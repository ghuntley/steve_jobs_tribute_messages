Bless you and your family Steve. I never met you but I somehow feel I've lost a friend and Can't help but feel saddened by your passing.&nbsp;
The world have lost an angel and the heaven has won a visionary: Steve Jobs, a man who changed the world and made the life better for all in this time.  My true condolences to his family and closest friends.&nbsp;
Forever and ever live the fantastic and incomparable Steve Jobs.   I am Brazilian and my memories will be in this man who became such in my life!&nbsp;
Steve's awesome creation, brilliance shapes the technology of today's entertainment. His creations are everywhere in the world, making bond with billions of people. His stamina, energy really make me think. He is truly a "Superman" to me. Today we have lost a great man, a inventor. He had talent to predict what common people wants. Wherever he is, may his soul rests in peace. Steve, we will remember you always.
Steve was one of the greatest humans ever to live and inspire human   innovation. He lives among the great names of, Ford, Disney, Edison,   Rockefeller. He will be sorely missed.&nbsp;
I loved every second I worked at Apple. Steve Jobs built the best technology company the world has ever seen. He will live forever through the inspiration he has put out into the world.
The iPhone that Steve Jobs has created has been more than a huge part of my life, as well as many other peoples. Only someone with a mind as brilliant as his could provide the world with technology with the capabilities instilled in all of the apple products. Even though not many of us were able to meet Steve Jobs or get to know him personally, everytime someone picks up an iPhone, iPod, or iPad it will be used in memory of Steve. As we continue to upgrade with Apple, every purchase, phone call, text, and download will be figuratively dialing into Steve's soul. These devices are now more than a phone, tablet, computer, and walkman, we all have a piece of Steve Jobs. Tech God.
Wish there was a mega-Nobel for innovation that changed the world for   good. I'm grateful and proud I've been a Mac person since Day One:   1985, and never used another kind. "Insanely great. The future is you."
 Thanks Steve Jobs for making the technology easy for everyone.
 My thoughts and prayers go to Steve's family, may God bless his soul. Rest in peace.  You really brought magic to the way we work, play, and comunicate. You will be missed.&nbsp;
We saved hard and bought our 1st Apple II when they came into the UK, as designers we knew personal computing was the way to go and Apple was the machine that made us go Wow!   Since then I have used an Apple product every day. For many years I had to endure other machines at work but coming home was always good because my latest Apple was there.   My Son is 24 years old, as an infant he learnt to stand by operating an Apple IIe with a joystick. He has never looked back and now has a career as a software engineer coding on Macs and on these he strives to always write the most elegant code.  I am grateful that I shall enjoy these retirement years of my life with Apple products keeping me online, informed and entertained. The Wow! has never ceased.  For the past 30 years and the years to come,   I Thank You, Steve Jobs.  My condolences to The Jobs Family and all Apple Company members.
I think of him  every time I text on my iphone I think of him every time I type on my mac I think of him every time I listen to my ipod... 
Dear Apple, My condolences to you all! Steve will be missed and remembered by all.
My very heart-felt condolences to Steve's family, friends and to all those at Apple who worked with him and loved him.  As someone who has grown up on Mac's from the first Apple Mac in about 1986 (in Australia), I have benefited from Steve's extraordinary creative genius and vision. I am so very sorry that he is gone but so very thankful for all that he did during his life.  He is an inspiration to me.<br>
The single most amazing individual of the 21st century. He has led the world with his gift to the world. I salute you Mr. Jobs. The small town Canadian, and the world has the utmost respect for you and what you have stood for.  Regards and deepest condolences.   
Steve Jobs created the coolest products on the planet. My whole family will miss him very much.  We pray for his family, friends and the whole Apple family at this time.
My younger brother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer recently. I sent him Steven Jobs' Stanford commencement speech which I found inspirational.  Steven Jobs has changed the world, and always delivered products that exceeded expectations. Unbelievable.&nbsp;
Our world lost one of the most important visionary... 
Mr. Jobs was an inspiration to me as a teacher of elementary school students!   I can remember cherishing my first IBM computer and marveling at the pure magic of it all when I was a child.  Now that I am an adult, I am blessed every time I see one of my students work with an iPad or iPod.  I see a spark of creative magic that Mr. Jobs himself would have been proud to see.  I could only imagine Mr. Jobs having the same spark of genius in his eyes when he was their age.  I pray that Mr. Jobs was able to see the final good work of his hands with the iPhone 4S!   I am hopeful that my students path will be just as bright as the path Mr. Jobs and Apple blazed before them.  Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs, the world is a better place because you lived!
I'm gonna miss you man! You will never be forgotten! You are my hero! 
Hi Steve,  I hope you are there hearing me. I know you are in my life, everywhere I  go, anybody I talk to  you know. You are my iPhone, MacBook Pro. You are  one of the greatest innovators that ever came.  Rest in peace
Thank you. Your creativity has made it possible for me, as a musician  and composer, to realize my dreams - from first recording music in my  bedroom, to creating music for feature films and tv shows, your machines  have changed my life and made the impossible possible. I can sincerely  say that every piece of music and art I've made in the last 15 years has  happened with the help of the tools you innovated.  Thank you for everything.&nbsp;
Thank you for everything. Im happy to say that eventually my kids will  learn about you in school and your name will be with the greats like  J.D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford. Great American Icons that  revolutionized the business world today.
 Even though I never met Steve I feel like I knew him just by following what Steve and Apple did. I feel like I am part of the Apple family and I will miss him and wish all of the apple and job's family my condolences. Rest in peace.
Dear Steve,  I honestly was not very familiar with Apple and Apple products until the past few years, and I didn't realize you were the man behind the apple until  a couple years ago. I've always admired your products, and never dreamed I  would own any until I was a lot older and working in the real world (I am currently in my senior year of college). However, through hard work I have done now, I acquired a Macbook this past year, and was surprised with an Iphone by my parents for being on the Dean's list. Those who know me eventually got annoyed with me constantly saying, " I can't believe I have a Mac, I  can't believe I have an Iphone." Your life's achievements are incredible. You were blessed with a gift, and  you shared it with the world. Not many can attest to that. As I mentioned,  I do not know you aside from what I have read. I know you through the Macbook I am currently typing on, and the Iphone that is next to me. Regardless  of how I know you, your passing strikes a chord with me. It is so hard to see someone with so much to give be taken so soon. Even as I type this I am  at a loss of what to say. A part of me doesn't even know why I feel this need to say anything at all. I'll end with condolences to your family and friends. And a thank you, for  being who you were, and doing everything you did while you were here.&nbsp;
I still remember being 8 years old or so (1990) and wanting a computer that was "fast and looked good." I was standing in a computer shop, which at the time consisted of ugly beige boxes with logos designed by engineers. The first time I saw an Apple computer I knew that was the machine I wanted.  Steve's obsession with design and usability should be a roadmap for any engineer, programmer, and CEO. Thank you for putting together the world's best and brightest to create that which changed everything.&nbsp;
Our condolences to the Jobs' family. Steve Jobs helped bring this world   closer and it became brighter with the help of his technological   innovations. May you rest in peace. 
We have lost a man who in his short years did more for this world than  many are able to achieve in a lifetime. His legacy will never die and he  will never be forgotten; a true visionary and inspiring legend. Goodbye.
I am an artist and I am a nurse.  Steve Jobs and Apple have had a really profound impact on my life, not just because of the all the amazing products which this former PC geek discovered, bought and which are part of my daily life, but because of his courage despite illness and his talent to lead the also very talented people who are part of Apple.  My deepest sympathies to his family, to his friends, to his team.&nbsp;
Never met him, but I certainly admired and respected him. 
The legacy you left behind will never be forgotten.
Wishing Steve's family my most sincere condolences.  He was a wonderful and i nspiring man - the world will miss his ability to Invent and inspire!  R.I.P . <br>
Your work inspired me &amp; so many others. Thank you.   "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." RIP Steve.   
He introduced a passion for technology in my life! God bless the genius, the man, husband, father, son, the visionary Steve Jobs was.
At a time when American Industry has badly lost its way, Steve set a  shining example of excellence and success by the plain and simple virtue  of envisioning great products, and then making that vision  happen---without compromise. While everyone else was racing to the  bottom, Steve marched Apple to the mountain top. Thank you Steve, for  showing us real productivity isn't about accounting tricks. It's about  innovation, quality, and design.&nbsp;
Thank you for enabling our creative genius.  Your spirit will live  forever in our work and dreams. 
In Ireland instead of mourning the loss of a life, we celebrate the life  a man lived and talk about what his contributions were.  We will be talking about Steve for some time.  RIP Steve.
 Steve Jobs was a remarkable man.His inventions and innovations have forever changed the world, and the way we work.He will be greatly missed. My condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues.
My condolences go out to steve and his family. Truly, one of planet earth's greatest minds in innovating technology. Once again the world has and will change, being so blessed with living during the life time and passing of Steve. May God bless him.&nbsp;
I am not sure where this email will go, but here it goes...  We have truly lost a visionary person that this world will never forget. His passion for life, inspiration, and true inspiration is what makes a unique leader.  I truly want to thank Steve for creating products that people will be using for generations to come.  More importantly, for helping my child communicate more effectively to us through the iPad.   Rest in peace and ensure that our prayers are with his family.
My prayers goes out firstly to the Jobs family, friends and people at large who his life's work affected. I just had to thank God for his life. Through his work he literally changed my life from my first encounters with a Mac way  back in the mid-eighties at college, through to becoming a graphic designer  right up until today. Thank you once again Mr Steve Jobs, who made expressing my creativity a complete joy. "once your a graphic designer, always a graphic designer" especially with a Mac to work on. -  Rest in peace.
My deepest sympathy and condolence goes out to Mr. Jobs and family.  The  world has lost a truly brilliant man that worked as long as he could.  I  think of him as one of my fellow soldiers that gave his life for the  happiness of others. May he rest in peace!!!&nbsp;
You changed the world.
I just hope Steve knew how much he was appreciated. He touched the world  in ways he probably didn't know. I know majority of the products that  come from Apple are as a result of all the talent there but his vision  and guidance and ability to look into the future helped shaped the  company. Steve has been an inspiration to me, I wish I was able to meet  him in person to express my appreciation for his passion that showed in  the products he made. He did make the best products in the world. He  really did care about the users as it showed in the products he made. We  love you steve.
Thank you Steve.  Your spirit and vision will live forever.  You were taken too soon from us, but you will never be forgotten.  RIP.
"Stay hungry. Stay foolish." S.J. Thank you.
steve jobs is a visionary. he is  like a distant family member we have never met, but praise all the time.  his products have permeated our lives for as long as i can remember. he  will be missed, but never forgotten. may his family find comfort it  knowing his vision and legacy will live on.
I never met Steve but wished one day I would. Living a million miles away we think of you as our guide to the tech future, and admire your innovations. Millions will miss you and I know we will remember you each year. I know ill be telling my son about how I lived in the years Steve Jobs was around changing the world. May the angels be there for you and may god have a place in heaven for you. May god comfort your family through hard times and give them strength.
I am very sad that he has passed away, he changed the world in many ways. I wish the best for his family and hope apple continues to do what they do best create amazing products. 
 I'm so sorry for your loss, Steve was a great man and he will be truly missed!
Steve has left the foundation of the way that the human beings interact with  machines. He always will be there, no matter what kind of equipment humans will use. His curiosity has shown that anything is possible in technology. We will miss him and his contributions to improve the quality of life of all  mankind.&nbsp;
In June 1980, my parents gave me an Apple II+ (I mean, an Apple ][+ ) for my birthday. I think I would still put it at #1 on my list of All Time Greatest Gifts Received, ahead of the Green Machine, the Atari 2600, and my baby brother.  Thank you, Steve Jobs. You may be the most creative, innovative businessman in American history. You made the world a better place.
Thank You Steve, You are and will alway be one of the great visionaries. You will be missed greatly.
No words can ever describe the impact Steve had, has and will have on the world. He may have gone, but his memory, effort, desire and vision reside in his creations. Thank you Steve!
A Great Man has passed, his innovations have opened many doors in my life being Apple user. God bless enjoy paradise.
Thank you not only for creating a company that inspires through innovation, but for sharing your journey with others.  Besides using Apple products to help me connect with my family, the commencement address&nbsp;you gave at Stanford helped inspire a greater connection between me and a younger cousin who was adrift.&nbsp;
 Thank you Steve for being a man whose vision was bigger than life.    You had a hand in every computer I have owned.  From the Macintosh   SE30 I bought in 1988 to my Mac Pro today.  You opened up the world of   computing to those of us who didn't possess a degree in computer   engineering.  I will miss you and your creative spirit and your always   intriguing "Oh.... and one more thing..." at the end of your keynotes   that always meant something exciting was going to be announced.  God Speed on your continued journey.  Blessing to your family in this   time of grief.
Thank you for your dedication to pushing technology further than anyone could have dreamed, in such a small space of time.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the greatest person anybody could ever hope to be. He has brought technology into the world that has literally changed lives. As I sit here and type this on my iPhone I recall as a 16 year old boy buying my first i Pod. The excitement level was overwhelming. As I grew up my apple collection  evolved and the release of every new keynote by Steve would leave me in tears, marveling at how possible the impossible had become. You haven't just given me a product Steve. You have inspired me to be better in life. You are t he reason I try harder every day at work and why I turn negatives in my life  into positives. You will always be my hero. Rest in Peace Steve.&nbsp;
This is such a sad day. I'm truly at a loss of words. Steve because of you and your creative genius I was able to tap into my own i nnovation. My music is what it is because you. To my regret I never got to m eet you, but your spirit and energy will always be present whenever I work.  Thank you for your time on this earth,  You will truly be missed. &nbsp;
As I type this from my iPhone I can't help to feel like I own a piece of his  history. He was a genius without a doubt and he will surely live on in our home, office, phones, and music! May you rest in peace
You will be truly missed Steve.&nbsp;
May he rest in peace. He was truely a genius in the Apple company. My sympathy goes to all of  his loved ones. 
The man who changed the face of the world. You will remembered forever.  Rest in Peace sir. 
Thank you for your incredible genius. Thank you for always supporting us through thick and thin ( even responding to my emails and input!-who knew ). Thank you for vision, belief in the why not and being the pirate instead of the navy. Here's to you, Crazy One. You changed the world.&nbsp;
 My condolences to the Jobs family. Steve Jobs was by far and  away my idol, and if I could one day affect the people in my life in  HALF the ways that he affected THE WORLD, I would be lucky. I always  viewed Mr. Jobs as a person who not only worked incredibly hard at his  job, but loved it. From what I could tell, giving up his position was  something that he would not have chosen to do if he had the option. I'm  a fifteen year old girl, and I really don't have any idea what I want to  do with my life, but I would hope to one day grow up to be as dedicated  as Mr. Jobs. I can say that the world has a lost someone who cared about  the consumer, which I believe is a rare thing in the corporate world.&nbsp;
Today we lost a great person. Of course he was a top innovator of our  time, but he was also a person. Everything he did he did not do for  himself but for his family and company. You never hear him in an  interview talking about himself, but about Apple.  He gave us things that today we cannot live without. As I'm writing this  I noticed that I am writing this to you on a MacBook Pro with the mail  app. I used the original iPod in 2001, I am an iPhone user and have been  for sometime, I have always wanted an iPad 2 but cant afford it yet,  (but will get it someday) haha. Apple has been a huge part of my life I  wouldnt be able to get through school without my MacBook Pro. So I would  just like to thank Steve and Apple for everything you've done for me  personally, the world would be a very different place if Apple didnt  exist.  Long live Steve. 
Today is truly a sad day for all of humanity. Steve Jobs, the same man who dropped out of college, and was kicked out of the company he helped start at the young age of 21, ended up changing the world.  We remember many innovators for their one lasting legacy and innovation. However, Steve will be remembered for many. He gave us the gift of the first real personal computer, Pixar, the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. With these products he not only changed or started a new market, he changed society.   R.I.P. Steve Jobs  You will be deeply missed but Your lasting legacy will be remembered and admired for centuries.   Gutenberg, Shakespeare, Edison, Einstein...Jobs. 
My generation has lost a brilliant and genius mind! Rest in Peace Steve Jobs, you will be missed. 
Rest in peace Steve, you will be dearly missed and are a huge loss to society. 
Steve Jobs, you gave me and countless others the tools to make our dreams and visions come true, all thanks to yours. A True Visionary.&nbsp;
First and foremost, id like to wish my deepest and sincerest condolences  to the Jobs family.  I know what it is like to lose some so close to  you, and i hope that you find some happiness knowing that the world  loved Steve.  I never had the honor of meeting him, but i feel like i  knew him because of his amazing work.  Its amazing to know that he  leaves millions of tiny pieces of himself all over there world in all  the inventions he pioneered.  
I want to make a record of my feelings to the family of Steve and the  whole  Apple's  family. The world certainly lost a great human being, a great genius, but his  legacy will be remembered for generations. I'll go on record my gratitude for all he did for society. A hug from Brazilian  admirer of his legacy.&nbsp;
There are a lot of firsts I remember in my life.  The first time I went on a picnic. The first time I got an A on a test. The first time I kissed a girl.  But nothing compares to the first time I picked up and listened to the iPod.  All in thanks to Mr. Jobs. Rest in peace. 
To all at Apple,  I may not have been a fan of Apple computer's and most of their products, but this was a truly great, innovative man who never gave up, even facing overwhelming odds.  For a man who continually reached for the stars his whole life, he finally got them.  God rest your soul, Steve.  You will be missed... &nbsp;
While I never personally knew the guy, I have had the honor and privilege to work for the company that Steve Jobs has started, for a little under a year. Even though I have been with the company for a short time, I credit Apple with helping me become a better person not only professionally, but personally as well. The culture of the company Steve created allowed me to meet a wide range of amazing and inspirational people. Never have I been able to wake up and enjoy going to work every single day. You’re company has changed my life not only by the products that you have created, but by the people chosen to represent the brand. I will be forever grateful.  Thank you Mr. Jobs, the world has lost a hero.
Dear MRS steve:  I am deeply sad to hear the loss of your steve,My condolences to you and your family. Hope you can get over it soon.  I will remember  steve and the words he said.&nbsp;
You are an amazing man Steve Jobs.
I feel as if I've lost a close friend. One that I've never met, but was part of my life every day. Steve Jobs will live forever in the minds and hearts of any person who has been fortunate enough to have their life enriched by the products and ideas that he has put before us. His life has inspired millions and his memory will continue to do so.&nbsp;
  You have touched the world. I doubt we'll see someone of your ilk in this lifetime. Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
As an adopted child I struggled with issues of identity and self-worth. I learned while very young that Steve was adopted, and this led me to look to him as a role model, an inspiration that lead me to study business and strive to think different every single day.  Thank you Steve, I directly attribute my success to you.  
Thank you Steve for making it cool to be the geek, and giving the world that  other choice.  I know you are now looking down on the world from heaven, but your spirit will always be with us.  Thank you.
Steve Jobs will be missed by all. Deepest condolences to his family and friends. Steve is a great inspiration and motivation to me. He has accomplished so many things, a terrible loss.
        Godspeed Rest in Peace, Mr. Jobs.  You were an incredible person and an inspiration to many.  The world has lost you in a physical form, but you live on through all of your amazing technological advancements.  You will be dearly missed.&nbsp;
Dear Steve-  Thanks for being awesome.
Perhaps my grief over the loss of Steve Jobs is a bit selfish. Being that I am realizing that the time is past of the possibility that I could thank him personally for the inspiration he has given me over my life. If you're out there surfing the infinite and manage to hear, "Thank YOU".&nbsp;
I was born in 2001. Then, on 2004, i tried out the old macintosh pro II. After, in 2007, I had my own iPod touch, now, in 2010, I have my own iPad, now,  2011, i have an ipod touch 4. I will miss steve jobs and his wonderful ideas that made Apple Inc. A success!
Mr Jobs has helped make lives much easier around the world. I can only thank  him, he will be missed!
Life is so beautiful and sometimes so sad. Thank you for all, Steve. You will be in my heart forever.&nbsp;
Steve you didn't die. Look around, pieces of your spirit lives inside each of us The struggles of the ordinary person to become the rebel, the extraordinary leader lives on. Thank you for your exemplary life. Live on...
 Although never met, I have enjoyed the happiness and convenience his Apple brings. And his courage inspired me. An Apple girl&nbsp;
JFK said "Some people see things as they are and ask why?  Other men dream of things that never where and ask Why Not?" No truer words represent such a person as Steve Jobs.  Our deepest sympathies and condolences go out to Steve's family, friends, colleagues and admirers.  A sad day indeed.
Thank you for a life well lived and for showing so many the endless possibilities of dreams becoming reality.  You will be missed.  Love, thoughts and prayers to your family left behind.&nbsp;
Thank you very much for your inspiring speeches. I got motivation from them. May your soul rest in peace. I will miss you!!! 
DEAR STEVE,  YOU'LL BE ALWAYS IN OUR MIND, FOREVER  &amp; EVER!   WE LOVE YOU!
 Steve Jobs changed the world with his vision and passion, and was a legend in his own time.  His short life on this planet was a gift to all of mankind.     He will go down in history as one of the most brilliant geniuses of all time, and students will learn about him for generations to come.  He was a groundbreaker!  While his early death is a loss to us all, his spirit will live forever!
As I sit in my home office today, surrounded by Apple products big and  small, it makes me very sad to hear of Steve's passing. I am struck by  the many ways I've been able to express myself through your products . .  . I designed that artwork on an iMac . . . that blues song I wrote was  recorded in GarageBand . . . I sent that poem to my wife through  MacMail. Sure, I guess I could have done all those things without Apple.  But Steve's vision made creating those things more enjoyable.  Thanks for giving a way to express ourselves, Steve. You'll be missed.
i would like to thank steve for his speeches and creative thoughts he  inspired me..he made me believe in my powers i hope i can be half of you  steve. thank you for making apple :) 
In a world where entrepreneurs and CEOs are exorbitantly paid for low  performance and running their companies into the ground, Steve stood out  as a man who made excellence at Apple a contagious virus. His vision,  his encouragement of innovation throughout the company has spread that  delightful infection to everyone who has ever used an Apple product.
I am profoundly sadden by the passing of such a visionary man who has touched so many lives.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family.
Steve offered the world new ways of being human together. A remarkable life. Truly.   The apple website tonight says it all.  Thank you.&nbsp;
My first association with a computer was in High School in 1985, programming BASIC for Apple.  For many of us Steve was there from the beginning of our personal tech revolution.  For many of us, Steve was the Gold Standard.  For most of us Apple remains the Gold Standard. 
Although I rarely used your products, I know you changed my world more than I can imagine. 
This day when Steve died ... Part of me died with him!  I always want to meet him one day , but unfortunately ... He was the man who give me a reason to do what I'm doing ...  Thank's Steve !  
To Steve's family, friends, and colleagues,   It deeply saddens me to hear of Steve's passing. He was an inspiration for me and all of us in the tech industry. His was a bright example of what can be done by those who do not accept the status quo.   I know there is nothing that can be done to bring him back, but please let me know if there is any way I can help to make his passing any more bearable. Steve will forever be fondly remembered by me!
Dear Steve,  We have never met, but yet you made an impact in my life.  Your passion, drive, and creativity is an inspiration to me. Your life  tells not just a story but leaves a legacy to all.   You are a legend. I thank you !! &nbsp;&nbsp;
dear steve, our star  &nbsp; now you became a real star ... are you there in the sky? &nbsp; You did make the world differently You did build new dreams You did change our mind and thinking &nbsp; thank you steve, goodbye steve &nbsp; we are so sorry for your loss, steve &nbsp; &nbsp;
Nothing I can say will ever relay how great of an impact Steve Jobs has had on my life. I could tell you about all of the iPhones, iPads, iPods, hardware, and software that I've purchased or used... but that's not the telling piece.  I admire Steve Jobs - the leader, the visionary. His family saw him as a dad, a husband... I can't even imagine the pain their hearts are carrying right now. The world is mourning today, Steve, for you changed the lives of millions and millions of people. Thank you for being one of the most profound human beings this world will ever see.  My condolences to his family, the Apple family, and all of the lives he touched during his short time on this Earth. God took Steve much too soon. I hope one day I have the chance to say, "Thank you, Steve."  God bless.&nbsp;
Steve jobs you will always be remembered. i just want to thank you. RIP!  
Hi Steve,    I'm Rakesh from India and know you very well… I'm a staunch believer of science and your work... but eventually both are the same.  My hearty condolences to you sir Steve Jobs.
  Goodbye Steve Jobs, your hard work has been an inspiration for this world, your vision of innovation has rocked this world!! you are a legend. Your body  might perish but your vision of innovation will remain. Goodbye Jobs... GOD  always be with you. rest in peace.
The world lost a true visionary today.  Rest in peace Steve. 
I almost feel like I lost a part of my family today. I've been buying and using Apple products since 1983 and most of my friends and family think I know Steve personally the way I talk about him and the company.   My sincere condolences to Steve's family, friends and the entire Apple community.  This is truly a sad day.
Thank you for your passion and innovative spirit - the world is a worse place without you. &nbsp;
Who knew I would be this saddened about the death of someone who I   didn't know personally. Thank you Steve Jobs, for your vision, passion   and always pushing others to create the impossible. Because of your   stellar tools you helped form my life and career.
Dear Apple/whomever will read this,  I grew up watching Steve launch new products in the way only he can ever do. He was and still is my childhood hero and taught me to always reach for the stars. His message was subtle but clear: you determine your future, make it worth every second and live life to it's fullest. It was through the keynotes I'd stay home from school to watch and save every penny I earned to buy anything Steve launched, that I learned to follow my dreams. Steve, wherever you are now, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for being everything you were and an amazing role model for me, even though the closest I ever got to meeting you was sneaking into a WWDC Keynote in 2003. The world has lost the most innovative and creative person to grace the modern world and I've lost a personal hero. RIP Steve. You will be missed severely.
RIP Mr. Steve Jobs,  I have never written a random letter like this but I just want to thank you for being a great asset to this world. Especially, for bringing such innovation in our technology. I have been in a long distance relationship with my fiancee. &nbsp;iPhone and Facetime has made everything soo much easier for us to communicate- it feels as if he was not even miles away! We are planning our wedding &nbsp;still apart from each other, but thanks to iPhone, wedding planning and preparations has been easier! You are amazing, and I just want to thank you for your brilliant mind. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
His life will continue to be an inspiration, but I am too sad for words right now.
If it hadn't been for Apple, I would never have discovered how much I   love design...and I probably wouldn't have become a designer. You have made a huge and lasting change in the world, and your life's   work helped me discover mine. Rest in peace.
10.5.11 Dear Inspiration,  Steve Jobs was the person of the world. It is hard to believe he died today. But he will live in our hearts forever. To me he was the best. One thing I always wanted to do was to meet him, but I never got the chance. Even though I was never able to meet him, I already feel like I know him through his awesome products. He really changed the way this world worked. I am just baffled. He is a legend that will live on forever. R.I.P Steve Jobs. Feb. 24 1955 - Oct. 5 2011&nbsp;
You have been an inspiring icon for me.  I used steve as a model of innovation, human being and strength.  We will always keep you in our hearts.&nbsp;
Steve inspired, invited, and got us excited about the future.    In a world in which so much of the future seems bleak, this is immeasurable.  Thank you for showing us a world we're excited about. 
You have changed computing and our lives.  Rest in Peace a great soul. 
Though we do not know Mr. Steve Jobs personally, we felt his genius around us. His work and his creations have inspired us, that nothing is impossible. We pray for his family and friends. We were blessed with Steve Jobs. Life will never be the same without his ingenuity.  God Bless.
A great loss to the world, for humanity and technology.  Rest in peace.
Steve is almost the father of the computer as we know it today. He built an amazing empire that is prolific and still growing. I say thank you to Mr. Jobs because without him, the modern informatic wouldn't be the same, at all.   Thank you and rest in peace.&nbsp;
My thoughts and prayers go out to Steve's family, friends and the people of Apple. He has changed all our lives for the better with his vision of using technology to enhance our lives.  He will be missed dearly.
 I wanted to write all of you together to let you know how saddened we were to hear of Steve Jobs passing.   He was, and will be present in every moment of our lives.  I'm confident that his creativity and extraordinary capability of envisioning the future will  guide us towards a better world.  Our sympathies
One of my role models since I was very little, and am sure an  inspiration for the world. Rest in peace   Mr. Jobs 
Steve, I cannot take in what is going on right now. You were a visionary, a  mastermind, and most of all, a great human being. Looking back on what  you provided the world and invented for all to experience is nothing  short of perfect. You were my role model, the person I looked up to, and  I find it so hard to realize that you are gone. It makes me so sad to  know that I will never see you unveil new products anymore. Your  keynotes and ideas always inspired and amazed me. I'm sure you are in a  better place now. Please Rest In Peace Steve. My thoughts and  condolences go out to your loved ones, friends, and colleagues. You gave  me so much and I am truly greatful for that. I wish it could all be  taken back. You are amazing. I will miss you more than ever. Thank you Steve.
The one CEO that earned his pay and more.  Sad to see a good guy go.
Rest In Peace Steve. Thank you for all your innovations. All of our lives have been truly changed by you. Whether we are a Mac or a PC, your visions have made it's way into our products. Your products have been used to produce most of the entertainment we consume, especially that from Pixar entertainment. Steve Jobs, you are an icon, and will be greatly missed.
I am at a loss for words.  This is a very sad day for all.  Steve was such a visionary.  He had the ability to create excitement in people!  Very rare.   
 What an amazing leader and visionary we have lost way too early.   Aaron  "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" Leonardo DaVinci  
‎24 years ago, a 5-year-old version of me sat at Epcot Center, listening intently as the narrator's voice described the future, promising that one day I would hold a phone and be able see the person I was speaking to on the other end of the line.  A few months ago I connected to Facetime for the first time. On the other end of the line? My father. 800 miles away.  Thank you, Steve. 
Steve changed the world, literally.  When one thinks of success, Steve come s to mind.  Steve will be remembered by children, and will be a name mentio ned in the far future, to resemble the change in the technological world.   Steve is the reason i have this beautifully working machine in front of me,  and the reason music has influence on my day to day life.  the only messag e the world needs to send to him is thank you. Thank you. 
Thank you!!!!   Thank you for supplying the world with many devices  that i love and  millions other love you may have gone but you will not have been  forgotten
For years now I have followed the broadcasts of Apple Keynotes that  always featured Steve in his familiar, trademark dress. Watching him, he  acted like no other CEO I've ever seen. He was always laid back, casual,  and spoke on a personal level to his audience. Watching the Keynote felt  like inviting Steve into my own living room, and having him talk to me  like a friend. Keynotes will never be the same without him, and neither  will the world. May he rest in peace. 
To Steve Job's Family and Team  I have followed Steve's story closely since 1986. I have read many of the articles, books (I have some on my bookshelf and two on my iPad), websites and anything else I could get my hands on.  His life has been an amazing and inspiring journey.  It is his passion, his thinking and commitment to the experience of the user that I admire the most.  May you all find peace and may Steve's legacy live on. &nbsp;
Very sad to hear of Steve's passing. Thanks for giving us your vision!
Steve, your iSoul will remain in every Apple user and product has your vision and creativity will inspire us to think, and step, outside of the box.
Me and my family are deeply saddened by the death of Steve Jobs   Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. My entire family is an "apple" fanatic and would save to buy apple products.  We will all miss the voice of Steve , an  amazing human being, who relentlessly give 110% all the time.  We extend our heartiest  sympathy to Steve wife and family. R.I.P&nbsp;
A deep condolences for our Steve Jobs, a big losses  of my iPhone 4 creator. Thank you Jobs 
In 1985 I went to an open house at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto Ontario Canada. It was a High School trip and while there I saw the coolest thing, a computer that had actual graphics on the screen, a picture of a lion as I remember. It was my first look at a Macintosh computer. A couple friends had Apple IIs at home but I had never seen one running, this tiny computer with a handle and mouse totally hooked me on computers. I went on to take Advertising and desk top publishing in college, Apple is the industry standard computer in this field. Steve was an inspiration to me, ignited my tech juices and passion. The world has lost a great entrepreneur, visionary and pioneer. His work helped change the way the world did everything. Goodbye Steve, God bless you and may the people you leave behind continue your legacy and take all that you have taught and given them onto bigger and better things in your memory.  Thank you,&nbsp;
For all my life I have heard about Steve Jobs as if  he was some changeless fact of Universe. So it really feels strange to hear he has  passed away and, though my interest about him has never been beyond my school books, I feel really sad to know that such a genius and special man is not among us anymore. Steve Jobs was an alive legend and his departure from this world surely leaves a sense of emptiness. To his family and friends, I would like to say that I am sorry and that I wish him to rest in peace.                                                     With all my respect and  admiration
It's very complicated/difficult to understand how Steve changed the  world to make people comfortable with computers.  There was something  special about how he simplified our electronic/mechanical connection  with them; he had a feeling of how computers should work with people to  make us all feel good about our Macs, iPhones and iPads.  There's a hole  in in the computer continuum. I'm not sure he can be replaced.&nbsp;
Steve  insipred many to follow ideals, to be themselves and to not be  afraid. He lives within all of us, and within Apple itself.
You shaped the aesthetics of a generation.  Thank you, Steve.
He made a dent in universe and is a source of inspiration for us to know that we can all aim do the same.  He will go on to serve as an example to human kind in the future. He showed us how raising the bar makes things 'just work'.  I will go to bed at night thinking how we change the world because of you. 
I don't have many heroes, but I am proud to say that Steve Jobs will always   be my hero! He taught me how to dream. He taught me how to live. He taught  me  passion for life. He taught me how to die! I will always love his  example of  life!  Praying for his family. May he rest in peace!!!!!!!&nbsp;
Thanks for all your hard work and accomplishments, Steve. You are a  great American innovator. God Bless and Rest in Peace. 
Dear Apple Family,  I work in Oncology Clinical Trial Research and specifically on a pancreatic clinical trial trying to develop a cancer drug that will help those patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. I truly know how horrible this disease is. I lost my mother to the same disease this April. I work hard everyday to help these patients and hope that one day we can improve patients' lives and cure this disease all together.  I am very sorry that Apple and the world have lost Mr. Jobs as he was a visionary and an excellent business man. My strong condolences to the Apply family! It is such a profound loss. I will take his memory and continue to work towards the development of cancer drugs!!
You will be missed Steve. All day I was using 4 of your products that made my life easier. Thanks you and I will never forget what you did for our world.  
To the world a great lost, obviously. To the Apple a eternal guiding light. To me a special man who brought me hope and inspiration. Thanks Steve Jobs, you made a great job.  
The legacy you have left behind &amp; your memory will live on forever. THANK YOU, and may your soul rest in perfect peace.
The world has lost a true pioneer .  I have had the pleasure of growing up in a generation that has seen technology go beyond what anyone could have ever imagined.  Thanks Steve for opening the future not only for myself but for my daughter who has only seen the beginning of what technology has to offer.
Being a Mac fan has been a part of my life for a long time. For three years in Middle school, in fact, it defined me: I was the Apple kid. It feels like... losing a favorite uncle who is also your personal hero. So I might sound pathetic when I write this... but it's what I feel.                  Why must genius die so soon?            Is it because the stars that burn the brightest                            Burn the fastest, too?                Thank you, Steve, for lighting my life                             And so many others                   Your life's flame has gone out                 But it will burn on in a million hearts                             That you ignited.
God bless Steve, thank you for making our world a better place.  Paul     
Thank you Steve.  You will be Missed.  I have admired your work for 30 years.  I am very sad.  My condolences to Laurene and his family.&nbsp;
To someone special,  Your revolutionary visions have changed my world and inspire my   children. We have always been and will always be in admiration of your   creativity. Steve, you will always be remembered. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Our deepest condolences to you and your family.  You will be missed but your legacy will continue.
I'm very sad. As an engineer, he is someone I looked up to. A visionary and a leader.
Here is to a man that built computers the best way he knew how. Thank you, Steve, for your life.&nbsp;
Steve, you're still alive on those you touched with your words, your imagination, your presence, your humor, and your leadership. i didn't meet you personally, just thru the media, but it was enough to know the kind of person you are. a kind one, a brilliant one. the world will miss your presence.
Thank you for thinking different and challenging everyone around you to do the same!
Thank you for revolutionizing our lives.   
In 1984, Steve Jobs gave the world the Macintosh and the Macintosh gave me a career and a direction in my aimless life. Thanks, Steve. 
"Hopefully you can keep on eye on us from up there, on your iCloud"
I was very close with Steve Jobs on a daily basis through the use of   the my MAC.  He was an extraordinary man with an unstoppable passion   for his creations.  I will miss him and his vision for Apple.
I work for this Company and would like to thank you for all you have done, my family is in debt to you, we love you Steve to you and your family.   I would be working somewhere i did not like if it wasnt for you Steve.  I love this Company and we will make it shine for you.  Respects from my family   Please let me know what we can do in memory of him &nbsp;
im sorry for the best and only genius man in the world . we were going  up with him but now we are going down . REST IN PEACE . 
Apple is like a family member to me... I've loved my power mac g3 tower, My ipod brick, my silver nanos, my glistening white ibook, my airport, my 17" macbook pro, my ipad and my iPhones... And we've lost our papa bear!!!&nbsp;
This man was one of the most amazing men in the world, and for that, I salute you, in heaven, where you belong.
To Apple, Steve Jobs has always been an inspiration to me as I progressed through  school, and even more recently as I've graduated and had to start  thinking about what I'll do with my life. Jobs' success after not  completing college, starting his own business from humble beginnings in  a garage and taking the world by storm has shown me that you don't need  to be a part of a system to succeed and that one's character and  perseverance will cause you to be admired and loved by everyone. Steve  Job's story and life has taught me to be steadfast and passionate about  what I do, excel in my strengths and improve on my weaknesses. Thank you so much for introducing me to a true role model.
The world has truly lost a true leader in technology.&nbsp; No other single person made me more excited about a product even before it came out.&nbsp; You will be missed 
A true inspiration. I've been a fan for many years and can safely say your vision has made my life better because of the products you so passionately pioneered. May a great man rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thank you for everything that you have given to us and all the inspiration you have given me, you have changed the world.
Thank you, Mr. Jobs for the impact you had on my life. My humble work  would not be possible without your great vision and spirit of  innovation. You are an inspiration to us all.
Hello.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  My first Macintosh.  1984.  I   was a graphic designer, and my world was about to change.  I embraced   it, and never looked back.  THANK YOU Steve, with all my heart; for permeating all areas of my   personal and professional life.
Thank you Steve  for being so creative and inspirational.  I cannot imagine how it must  have been like to be able to work with someone like you.  You fought a  courageous battle and I am so sorry you had to leave.  You have to know  you left the world in a much better place!!  Peace be with you - the  World is going to miss you.
Mr. Jobs was the Thomas Edison of our generation. If it wasn't for him,  i would not be typing on this mac right now. He really did change the  world we live in today. RIP
Rest In Peace Mr. Steve Jobs, you were what started the new era of technology we live in today... Thank You.
 I remember the days when the Internet was dial-up; the days it took minutes to load a screen. I remember running to class hoping to be the first in lab to get the computer I desired. I remember the day I woke up on a bright sunny morning, snow outside, and the fireplace crackling. I remember the joy I felt on Christmas Day, the unwrapping of presents and the smell of delicious breakfast awaiting. I remember the moment my eyes caught a glimpse of a large box awaiting behind my parent's back, that Christmas morning.  They say the last gift you receive is something meaningful, no matter the size of the box. I never believed in it... I remember the moment my hands laid on my first Apple; a strong joyous feeling I will never forget. And I will always remember the person who was behind it all, Steve Jobs, who not only changed my life for the better, but better for the lives out there.&nbsp;
 Thanks Steve your vision will be missed!! :(
I will miss him like a family member. His vision and focus was and is an  inspiration to millions. Peace be with you my friend.
I never forget you, rest in peace, you change my word, your dreams make my dreams&nbsp;
Through this message I would like to express my sincere sorrow for such  an enormous lost for Apple and for humanity, Steve is an example for the  future generations. This is something I can tell from experience since  he has enlightened my sons  as a model of a successful person.
Millions on Earth are touched by your creativity every day - all will  miss you and your genius - rest in peace. 
May God welcome Steve Jobs as a person who&nbsp;made the world a better place&nbsp;through  innovative technology, inspirational vision, and and desire to provide many  conveniences more accessible to people the every place on earth.&nbsp; The marvels  made possible by the inherent talent&nbsp;by&nbsp;Steve Jobs, worldly citizen&nbsp;of the  century,&nbsp;provided&nbsp;advancements in sound, music, telecommunications, internet  accessibility and, video imagery.&nbsp; The technological&nbsp;advancements guided by  Steve Jobs, though Apple,&nbsp;gave us the world over a better sense of enrichment, a  value&nbsp;of appreciation and, sincere gratitude through the dedicated&nbsp;work&nbsp;by Steve  Jobs.&nbsp; His&nbsp;unyielding sacrifices and desire of perfection&nbsp;can be seen though the  quality products, that earned&nbsp;respect the world over.&nbsp; Steve Jobs, you will be  remembered, never forgotten and&nbsp;appreciated for&nbsp;all you have done to make this  world a better place!&nbsp;
he will be there with us forever.. and everywhere wherever iphone, ipad, imac, itunes, ibook is......   rest in peace. 
Thank you Steve for making my life as a travelling mum easier.&nbsp; My kids (4 years old and 1r old) can easily use the ipad and skype me anytime they want to speak to their mum.&nbsp; It makes life as a working mum easier with a peace of mind..&nbsp; I wish your family peace and comfort in missing you in their lives.&nbsp; May they be comforted with your legacy.
Apple today would not be the same company and be the market leader in computing without the vision and ambition of Steve Jobs. The world has lost a great man. No doubt his legacy will remain for many, many years.  Thanks Steve, for everything he gave us as the co-founder of Apple, and as a human being.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
He will be remembered in history along side Thomas Edison and Benjamin Franklin. I feel fortunate to have lived through the transformation of personal computing he led. I think he shake things up pretty bad up in the sky with the big guy... 
Wow! I am deeply saddened, at this time, to hear of the passing of Mr.  Steve Jobs. I am a very big supporter and consumer of all things Apple  and was disappointed when I learned of his resignation. I can only hope  and pray for the strength of those who are affected by the loss. I will  feel the void anytime Apple is mentioned or whenever I utilize my many  Apple devices. He was certainly an innovative, genius, and seemingly  kind soul. He will surely be missed by myself and others.
Thank you for giving the world innovation and inspiration, not only pushing Apple, but in turn everyone else to be better.     While I do not own any Apple products I always regarded Mr. Jobs as a very important figure in technology, and always will.  The genius that is Steve Jobs will be never forgotten.     My condolences to all the friends and family
 I am still in shock...the news hasn't yet sunk in.  This couldnt be true, could it? This man changed technology like no one ever has.    One of a kind.  May his soul rest in peace.
Because of you Mr. Jobs, we will always "Think Different". Rest in peace.
It feels just like yesterday when I sent an email to Jobs at age 9, saying how great Apple and all of their products were. He quickly replied "Thanks Mike, I'll make sure that we live up to your expectations." What he said couldn't have been more correct. Steve was a great leader and innovator, and without him, Apple would not be what it currently is. I express my deepest sympathies for Steve's family, friends, and colleagues.&nbsp;
You changed the world. You changed the way we live our lives. You're innovation and creativity will inspire the world for generations to come. You will be missed – and never forgotten.
Thank you for all the wonderful things you brought in to this world. And thank you for making it so easy to comprehend technology. You will be missed. Thank you for everything. Having a part of your technology makes it so  much more and better. 
To his family, friends and the people of Apple-  Mr. Jobs was and will remain an inspiration, particularly to those who  are driven and creative.  May God bless his soul and may his friends and  family be comforted. 
Thank you Steve for all the greatness you left in our hearts and in our hands! I'll always ride the wave of your legacy.  To Steve family, friends and colleagues at Apple I send you my deep condolences.
What an amazing, creative force Steve was.  We are saddened to hear of  his death. 
When  you have tears hearing about someone passing on and have never met  that person, it is a sign of someone who has truly affected this world.  I am an artist making a great and fun  living in this world because of  Steve Jobs. Wow! 
I always admired Steve he was an awesome Entrepreneur, Visionary, Inventor and now he has left a big hole in the map of invention in USA which cannot be filled in.   May God bless his soul and may he rest in peace. May God give his immediate family friends and his employees the strength to deal with the loss.
Though this is a moment of sadness and loss as surely we have lost a great mind, innovator, and icon, I can't seem to shake the following phrase in homage of a legacy still not even fully realized:  "iLive On."  Mr. Jobs-I never knew you but for your quotes, charisma, drive, and technological genius, which is to say I must have known you well. You will indeed live on, sir, as an inspiration for us all.&nbsp;
I fell in love with computers when I first saw the Apple IIe.  You made computers fun, exciting and most important ensured the human interaction with machine was perfect, seamless, elegant.  You created and recreated what Apple is and in a way groomed a generation of technologist to think different.  Thank you for all of your innovation.  You have changed a generation, one person, one product at a time.  You will be missed but never forgotten.
Love his products very smart man you can tell by his past speeches and  development of apple products rest in peace steve maybe he will bring as  much education to the next life we will miss you steve 
I cannot type so many thank you in a row, so i will do it once for all  of them.....THANK YOU. 
I just wanted to say goodbye to the man who played such a pivotal role in my technological development. Steve, you have changed my life without ever meeting me. Thank you.&nbsp;
Steve you have been my mentor all my life. You created the iPod touch and now the iPhone. You have been an inspiration to the world. We will all miss you and we know you will be still inventing and using your creative mind in heaven. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.
What a sad day! Steve Jobs, RIP. Thank you for your vision and amazing contribution to the world.
Steve will truly never be forgotten.  His love for changing lives was always shown. 
My first computer was an Apple II.  My first encounter with the web was using Claris Communicator.  The company's products were a meaningful part of my childhood, and now I am the proud owner of a small business that uses Apple products exclusively.  My thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family.  His contributions to technology and humanity rightly earned him the legacy that lives on.&nbsp;
This is a Sad Day for the Tech World. I want to Graduate with a Degree in Computer Science and work for Apple. Steve Jobs' Ideas were very inspiring to me, and will continue to live on through our thoughts of him. 
 So very sad to hear that Steve Jobs has passed away.  We have lost one of the great ones.  Sincerest sympathies to his family, friends and colleagues.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs changed the world for the better.  Our lives are enriched   for what he created.  He will live forever in his ideas and inventions   of the IPhone, IPOD, Mac and think Pad.  My condolences to his   family.  He was taken too early.
Steve, We will be with you forever. Thanks for everything you have done for us.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs now belongs to history and he will forever be included with the great inventors he followed. He will be greatly missed, but never forgotten. I work on my MacBook Pro, communicate on my iPhone, listen to music on my iPod and explore the world on my iPad. "Thank you Steve".&nbsp;
Our deepest sympathy for the family. Our family feels as though we have  lost a friend.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an inspiration to our generation of college students.   He revolutionized the tech industry and will be forever missed.&nbsp;
 I am sad to know that Steve has left us. I use the products that he leads the company to create and produce. I am typing this email with a Mac Book. The spirit of his and of his company that he has delivered this spirit too, have already changed part of my life. He not only changes the world and he also changes our thoughts in a positive way - we can do anything if we are brave enough. When I see my Mac products, I will always remember Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
You made design sell. You knew it was important and we thank you.&nbsp;
Our sincere condolences on the loss of your husband, father, and visionary leader.  My family has enjoyed the Apple vision since our first Mac Plus in 1988, which we still have and still works.  My son grew up with the user centric, user friendly Mac system that Steve was responsible for.  Steve shared with all of us a creative mind and vision that believed devices should be about enhancing life, not numbing our minds to blithering followership. He was never one to toot his own horn, the whole was always more important than the one. I am thankful we were able to benefit from the fruits of his vision. His zest for life was infectious.  May he rest in Peace. And may you find comfort knowing how much he was loved and appreciated by so many.  He made our world a much better place to live in.
Sad noises keep playing in my head. The picture on apple.com shows Steve in his prime. Unstoppable passion. He will be missed. :( 
My heart is breaking for your children, your wife, and all those you've touched. Truly a great man in a world which desperately needed your example, dedication, determination. Thank you so much for being an inspiration to us all.   Brightest Blessings, love &amp; light for you and your loved ones.&nbsp;
Steve jobs, you were always my hero. I will never forget you. Thank you Steve jobs for everything. I will miss you. Good bye. :'( 
Your creations have singlehandedly dragged me into the world of  technology. So much that my future is focused on it. For that, I thank  you. Rest in peace. 
To remembering Steve,&nbsp;He leaves us with great memories. All will be instilled in our hearts  forever. He was an amazing man with a great mind. We will forever remember Steve  as a tremendous leader and devoted CEO.   May he rest in peace.
  I'm deeply sadden by the news of mr Jobs passing, my prays to his family and the Apple family. We not only lost a genius, also a father, friend, boss, example to follow, an american. But also he was a world renown human being. I know you will have a foundation on his behalf for his decease. God have him in his heaven. Steve Jobs rest in peace, and the Apple family continue with his legacy for years to come.             
Thank you Steve, for the smile you put on my face when I unpacked my first Apple IIe, and countless smiles ever since.  God bless you, your family, and friends.        
To his family, God give them confort in this trouble times. To Steve, thanks for your legacy, vision and for inspiring us.
Mr Jobs made my life better, more productive, more fun, more rewarding.  
Rest in peace Steve Jobs. Thank you for all the amazing staff you invented through your life. Thanks to your knowledge, I can use all these amazing staff, such as an iMac, which I am using to write this short, but significant paragraph. Thanks to you I could hear my music wherever I want, with my iPod. Thanks to you I can use a tablet, which is much easier to carry. You really did something good for the world. You changed it. I don’t have words to thank you for everything you did. THANK YOU STEVE JOBS. REST IN PEACE.
Why is it that the brightest stars burn quickest? Stay hungry, stay foolish. 
  Life is a book in volumes three- The past, the present, and the yet-to-be.  The past is written and laid away,  The present we're writing every day,   And the last and best of volumes three   Is locked from sight - God keeps the key.  I will always remember the day I was given my very first Mac computer, a Mac Classic. and ever since, I have been a true believer in Apple. and will always.   Thank you Steve... you will not be forgotten.&nbsp;
My condolences to Mr. Jobs and his family and friends. He was an inspiration to all. 
Steve Jobs was a genius and will be remembered 300 years from now, as  Michelangelo, da Vinci, Einstein and Darwin are today. This is certainly  a sad day.&nbsp;
He brightened my world in so many ways, I can never express how many  ways he enriched my life and my family's - we will forever be  "connected" because of him and his wonderful company Apple.  May his family find peace in all the wonder he created in this world.   His memory will be with us always.
       For those of us fortunate enough to read of Steve Jobs, and the projects of which he was the key component, the phrase to me is  " truly a great American businessman".   Right up there with the greats of all time Ford, Edison, and Jobs, in no particular order.                            
 Although I vastly prefer the PC over the Mac, without you, none of which I enjoy today would be possible. You have my full respect. May God bless you.             
Just a note to one of my heros. Thank you for changing the world. 
Like the great inventors before him - I thank him. I thank him for enabling me to work faster and smarter in my career as a designer.   Please maintain Apple the way only he would - for tomorrow - always thinking about the future. I am honored to have shared his time on Earth.
What can we say?  It's so sad to lose Steve. We love our iPhone &amp; iPad so much. Our whole family is Apple thanks to his brilliance. We will miss him &amp; wish the best to his family &amp; his Apple family.&nbsp;
You helped to shape the future of technology and the way how you it as influenced our life. Your great inventions are an inspiration to our generation. You will be missed and your work will live on. May god watch over your family  and keep them safe.  May your soul Rest in Peace.
Hello Steve:   I know you are tired enough and this is not a world you interest any more, because you have already made us crazy than nobody else can do. But one thing you must know , that is we love you and are pretty impressed by your speech, your smartness and everything about you!!   I do not know how to say something accurate to show my mood. I just wanna say, thank you Steve, you are always and forever my mentor!
My deepest condolences to the Jobs family. My father is battling cancer as I type and he may be gone before the end of the year, so I am experiencing some of what y'all have experienced these past few months.  Mr. Jobs' drive and vision and given life to computing and inspired a generation. While there will never be another Steve Jobs, I know that his spirit will live on in all of us.  Best wishes to Apple's employees. I trust that Steve has built a great team that will do justice to his legacy.  Thanks for great products and thanks for great vision!&nbsp;
Although I never knew Steve Jobs personally I was blessed to be on the receiving end of his genius that he shared with the world..  What a great mind &amp; a tremendous gift to the world &amp; how I admired his vision..     RIP Steve &amp; my deepest condolences to your entire family &amp; your extended family at Apple..     What will we do without you..&nbsp;
Today, I lost a mentor, a visionary and someone I wish could have been a friend.  His early work with the Mac started me on the first 13 years of my career.  I will miss his direct infuence on my life and the world.  Rest in peace Steve Jobs!  You will be missed! 
I am a man who has, since childhood, always loved technology and everything 'gadget'.  Steve Jobs' Apple has always challenged innovation to the limit, and it continues to amaze me in what it is able to produce.  All of my biggest and best 'wow' moments when it comes to technology I owe to Apple and particularly to Steve, from the first Mac computers, to the iPod, the Mac Mini, the iPhone, the MacBook and MacBook Air, all of which I have owned or now own.  There is just something about these products, their design and their intuitiveness, that they almost 'know' you, know what you want them to do and how to make your life easier and more fun.  No other technology brand has done that for me.  So thank you, Steve.  I am deeply saddened that you are gone and my thoughts go out to your family and your devoted company staff at this difficult time.  I will continue to believe in Apple and I know that your legacy will shine on in the years to come.&nbsp;
 I have touted the genius of Steve Jobs since the 1980's when I first  touched an Apple computer. I've called him the "wunderkind" of all times  since Mozart. I am deeply touched and saddened by this news. Today, I am a Technology Coordinator at an elementary school in North  Hollywood, CA. I run and designed our Mac Computer Lab and teach my  students daily about the wonders of Apple computers. Sometimes the other  teachers think I'm always doing a commercial for Apple and I do my best,  and successfully, mind you, to convert the wayward PC users over to  Apple. They are fully aware that I play favorites when it comes to  Technology. Stick with the best, Apple.  Steve Jobs is a man I've introduced to my students over the five years  I've been at the school. I tell them about his genius and how Apple  started with the two Steves. Tomorrow, when I open up my Lab, I will  have a small memorial commemorating this wonderful man whom I've loved  since 1987.Thank you, Steve, for making this a smarter and more fun world because  of Apple. Now, it is up to Apple, Inc. to carry on that greatness and  keep your spot at the top of innovative Technology.&nbsp;
Solo, gracias por todo lo dado Steve!!&nbsp;
Some kids grow up aspiring to be great rock stars or astronauts. Some kids want to be glamour models or great heroes in the forces. Some kids want to grow up to be a leader, some want to be millionaires. As a teenager going through school I was inspired by the story of the two Steves, and though I will never have the privilege of meeting Mr Jobs in this life, I owe my own motivation in life to his story, his resilience, his legacy. I will forever remember where I was on this day.
Thank you Steve for Apple, Pixar and all of your innovations to the world. You will live on as one of the greatest visionaries of all time.  Rest in peace. 
We have enhanced opportunities to connect with the world and learn about each other due to how this great motivator led the talent he inspired.  To his family...no words can describe the impact of his contributions on technology and his tendency to thinking outside the box.  The world is a better place because Mr. Jobs was a part of it.&nbsp;
Although only a recent iMac purchaser I have always been fascinated by  Apple devices over the years (have owned quite a few), and although not  all were to my taste, their appeal, design and ease of use cannot be  questioned. RIP - a sometimes controversial but ultimately fantastic visionary in  the IT industry. 
hi everyone,  i'm young enough that i barely remember that first big apple commercial - running down the aisle with the sledgehammer and throwing it at big brother (still one of my favorites) - but apple's innovations changed the way i thought about computers.  my world is a different place today because of what steve jobs did.  my thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues.  he'll be missed by us all.  but he left us a great legacy.  cheers dkw  ps. of course, i'm writing this on a mac.
A man who left the world a better place than he found it, an achievement we should all aspire to.
Rest in peace visionary&nbsp;
While I was not lucky enough to have known Steve Jobs personally, I frequently found inspiration from this great man. What better can be said then simply: "The world is indeed a better place because of Steve Jobs".&nbsp;
Hi,   Hope you're feeling better now. Steve's done such a great job these years and we all love him. He's a fantastic dreamer and what separates himself from others is he really made it. He will always be with us. Hope you could keep on. Stay strong, stay brave.
rememberingsteve team, thank you very much for this mail address. -  Hi Steve/Mr. Jobs,  You and my first computer, Macintosh, could change my and our life dramatically. And you could bring future to us. It was precious for me to see the future through you. Please let me say Hello/Thanks to you someday, somewhere. Good Luck and see you in heaven. Thank you so much, Steve.  Regards
Your brilliance and passion for your work will have a profound effect on generations of people. 
My sincere sympathy goes out to his family and friends.  He changed the world forever...for the better.  Thank you Steve   
Thanks for using what God gave you to impact the world.  My family is praying for the Jobs family. 
to Apple ... and the universe ... for offering up this genius and leader.  Steve Jobs' mastery of his skills -- and commitment to living a life that fully capitalized on those skills - have shaped our culture. Most importantly, the life he led - on his own terms - have shaped how we all will live and aspire in the future ... for as long as we are here.
Our Sympathies to Steve Jobs family and friends.  We just wanted to say he made a difference in our lives in so many ways.  He made technology usable and friendly. He brought our memories to life  and we are able to create laughter and tears using Apples amazing tools.  We can only feel a fraction of your loss but we do feel the loss and our  hearts and prays go out to you.&nbsp;
The world should be divided as follows: Before Steve Jobs and after Steve Jobs. From today we are at the after.
I was shocked and very saddened to hear of the loss of one of the greatest minds of this age. Although I never knew Steve Jobs personally, his influence has made a tremendous impact on my day to day life. I have become in my area (Philadelphia Metro) as the "iPostle" since I crossed over from PC to Mac user in 2007. I not only own multiple iDevices and Apple computers, but I managed to convert many of my friends and family to do the same, here in the US and in Europe. I used to kid around with friends saying that "Steve Jobs owes me money..." but in reality, I owe him a lot of kudos for making my life a whole lot easier. I always looked forward to his new product presentations at Keynote. I was also shocked when he stepped down as CEO a few weeks ago. Mr. Jobs' shoes will be very difficult to fill. I will never forget him. May his ideals and influence live on for ages to come.&nbsp;
You changed the world. Thank you.   
Steve Jobs was and still is my idol! He did so much for apple and even THE WORLD. He was amazing! If the world has someone who is just close to him, we will still be okay. No one can to compare to him. I will always remember him. In 20 years from now, and kids will all want the IPhone25, I can say, "I remember the first IPhone by Steve Jobs. He created the start of almost every electronic you have." He will be missed and never forgotten!<div><br></div><div>A fan who strives to be like Steve</div>
The 1984 commercial still gives me chills. &nbsp;Thank you, Steve, for what you accomplished first at Apple in the 1980's, then at Pixar, then again at Apple. &nbsp;You proved that the computer revolution was indeed a PERSONAL computer revolution. &nbsp;Then you gave us the greatest movie studio of our time. &nbsp;Finally, you gave us the sleekest, funnest, most easy to use and apply computer devices that literally put the computer in the palm of all of our hands. &nbsp;What a legacy. &nbsp;Godspeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;
   Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. You were simply the best  we will miss you             
Steve,   You have improved our lives. Thank you &amp; thank you!  Thank you and Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
He had a singular vision of how technology could be made to enhance the human experience.  The uncompromising will to transform sand and ore into a few mystical talismans.  A giant upon whose shoulders we stand.&nbsp;
I bought my first Apple Computer in 1981.  Everyone at the company I was working for laughed at me and said 'What is that?'  I drove to Miami to buy it; six months later, the company I worked for bought it from me, and it became a legacy item at the company.  Thank you, Steve, for everything you did for all of us over the past 30 years.  We will never forget you.  And God bless your family at this very difficult time.&nbsp;
I never knew him in person, but he has been a major influence to many.  Even me. He has also brought so much to this world. I wish I could grow  up to be such an influence and innovator like him. I wish I could've  gotten to known him in person. You will be greatly missed Steve. 
I'm so sorry for your lose, I wrote an essay about him last year,  because he was a huge inspiration to me. My condolences go out to his  family. RIP Steve Jobs 
I would like to send my Condolences to his family, his friends and those who worked closely with him.Unfortunately I was none of these things, but if I'm saddened by the news. I can't imagine what they're going through. Truly he was a pioneer of the greatest technology to ever hit the planet and as a big fan i know its not just about the product, It's about the man behind it. That's why I'm a fan of Apple, because I am and will alway be a fan of Steve Jobs.  Sincerely,&nbsp;
Remembering? How can I forget!. I have lived among Apple products since 1981, when I acquired my Apple IIe (still have it and works). I feel the loss as if it was part of my family. Steve jobs IS part of my family. He will live forever on every drawing that I made with Mac paint, on every print out from my imagewriter, on every email that I have ever written on my iPhone, iPad, Mac pro, MacBook air, MacBook pro. &nbsp;I will continue to listen and enjoying his legacy every time I start my Harley Davidson and my HD branded iPod nano starts to play. I live immersed in an Apple world. Mr. Jobs , thank you for making our lives so much better in so many ways. It's hard to believe than physically you are no longer with us but in my house , you will live in every corner forever.
God be with Steve's family, friends and co-workers.
The changes you have made in the lives of people all over the world go far beyond introducing some of the most revolutionary products the world has ever  seen. The iPhone allows me to make a difference in the lives of the Patients I serve as an emergency medical technician everyday. It has provided a pla tform for useful tools that allow me to be better at my profession. You have  changed the world in every facet imaginable and the world is truely better b ecause of you. Thank you for being a commited perfectionist for the betterment of the world. Look down on us from iHeaven. Hope to see you up there some day buddy.
It is such a tragedy that we have lost such an amazing person we will remember his contribution to the society's creativity and technology and will always appreciate all the amazing products that he had brought to us and that is not only the wonderful mac but also the encouragement and inspiration he has brought to the modern society and the improvement in technology everybody in this society loves steve jobs in different ways and this will continue and we will remember him forever.
No words i can say are expressing the loss the human kind encountered   for such a person who impacted the life of every person , directly or  indirectly .. May God Bless his Soul.
We are all fortunate to have lived to witness Steve's creativity and innovative genius.  May we all be inspired by his greatness and never forget his spirit.  Thank you Steve for sharing your gifts with the world.
Thank you for changing all of our lives.
My thoughts are with Steve's family and the Apple community.  He truly was an innovator and changed the world for the better.  Rest in peace, Steve. 
Thank you, Steve, from the mother of an apple family who usually gets  the apple hand-me-downs from her sons, but occasionally buys her own.  We've all learned &amp; designed &amp; produced &amp; kept touch through all of our  apple products over the years. We have all loved &amp; benefitted from your strong sense of design, your  innovations in technology and the the results:  beautifully functioning  products that continue to make our lives richer.  With all thanks to you &amp; to your families - both apple &amp; private.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was one of the most inspiring people in my life!!!&nbsp;In such short span of time, he made people experience future! He changed the world and turned impossible into possible. &nbsp;I am a huge Apple fan and i cant believe the Father of Apple is gone. I am feeling extremely low and sad today.&nbsp;Truly&nbsp;a Genius! God Bless him in peace and heaven! His inspiration will never die! RIP.
Steve, in many ways, was like a second father to me. He didn't even know of my existence yet he has been such an inspiration. I eat, sleep, and breath Apple, I love the products, even after having had my iPhone 4 for 16 months now I still get a nice feeling whenever I "Slide to unlock".I don't know what to say. I feel as if a close friend has passed away yet I have never spoken to Steve once in my life.All I can say is thank you Steve. You were an inspiration to me and many others. Stay hungry, and stay foolish up there in that iCloud.
  You made America proud to have a son like you;    You made the world proud to have human being like you,   You have done your own work on earth and in Bayangi tribe in CAMEROON we say    You will come again!!!    I Thank God for this 1st phase your beautiful short life on earth.   May your beautiful soul rest in peace until the 2nd phase.   NOW PLEASE KEEP THE JEANS AND turtleneck!!!     Thanks for everything&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was one of the best inventors of our time. If we had more people who thought like him, America would be in a lot better shape right now. RIP Steve 
I was shocked and saddened to hear that Steve Jobs passed away - what an  incredible loss!  He made an incredible contribution to the way we work,  communicate and enjoy technology. He will be missed by everyone - my  deepest sympathies to his family and friends.
Steve Jobs changed my world for the better. I didn't know Steve Jobs. I  never met Steve Jobs. But the thought of him, his quest for excellence,  his passion for life and everything that intrigued him, inspires me  every day to be better than I am. It seemed to me that Steve was all about character and living a good  life. Steve was a consummate teacher. In the end, this intensely private  person taught us how to live and taught us how to die. My heart goes out to his wife and his children. Although it is so very  sad to lose a husband and father at such a young age, what a blessing  for his children to have experienced him and to have been influenced by  him, especially these wonderfully creative and productive last few  years. Rest in peace.
 im sorry to here about steve jobs :( he made so many great products i own an iphone 3Gs 16GB its an amazing product im confident that apple will come out with more great amazing products  apple is the future of computers steve jobs left behind a legacy &amp; will be put&nbsp;in Earths history books
Muchas gracias Steve por permitirme trabajar en los "productos de tus sueños". Buen viaje y mucha luz para tu familia.&nbsp;
I feel blessed for living during a time in which such a creative mind shaped the ways by which we live. Mr. Jobs' ideas and products have had and will  continue to have great impact on improving mankind.  Thank you, Steve!
I just got my first Mac this week :'(. Thanks Mr.Jobs for making my  video editing dreams come true. RIP 
Steve Jobs was a brilliant human being!  All Brazilians pray for his soul.  Our condolences.
  Thank you Mr. Jobs for making some awesome dreams a reality to all. 
I think it is very telling that I write this to you on a MacBook Pro, which I think Steve would be proud of. We have lost a visionary, a pioneer and an adventurer. Nothing will ever be quite the same again. I never knew him but I am upset. He was such a revolutionary thinker and he always had a new way to do things. My sincerest sympathies to his family. He will not be forgotten. His legacy lives on in technology that we all use and love using. I think he'd like that. He saw what we should be doing and now, we're doing it! He was a marvellous man! 
I have been a loyal and faithful supporter of Steve for over 20 years. he has been my hero and a role model for years. His approach to business, his attention to detail, his vision for what his customers need, and his ability to deliver stunning pieces of technology has been beyond what anyone else has done. saving Apple and bringing it to where it is today. I am head of IT and am often been accused of being on Apple's payroll for my unweavering  belief in them and what Steve Jobs has delivered.  The world has lost a talented and awesome human being. The world has lost a true genius. One in a billion. God bless you my friend.
my thoughts are with Apple and my prayers with your family. thank you for  ipods and iphones and my macbook.
Just wanted to say how amazing of a person i thought he was. He was a huge influence in our lives and of all the lives to come. I wish i could say more that would really encompass how i feel about his passing. I noticed on facebook the hundreds of my friends who had posted sad status's related to him and i thought that instead of also posting something mournful i would celebrate his life so i said "Im sure heaven is decked out with YOUR stuff so everyone can continue to enjoy the amazing product you've given us"  totally meant it. words dont do him justice. just like the tingly feeling you get from watching an apple commercial...there is no word to convey the feelings of respect, admiration, and love.   May he rest in a delightfully happy and fulfilled peace.
 I think we all felt like we knew Steve because everyone looked up to him  as an icon and genius. There is no CEO that inspired people both in and out  of the Tech world as he did. &nbsp;To all who knew him personally my best wishes. Thank you Steve, you truly changed the world.
Thanks, for making my life better, thanks.
 Speechless. A visionary who changed the way we as humans interact and connect with one another. He will be deeply missed. 
Dear Steve,   As you now take in your heavenly breath may your loving spirit be at peace with the Lord of Creation.  Thank you Steve Jobs, you have changed the world.  Thank you for your beautiful mind, your inspiration and your insight to build a better place for people to reach out, to begin to know one another in a personal way, bridging cultural, social, and economical difference.  You will always be remembered with the greatest of minds, removing the delineation of place... in communication, in harmony, and in lifestyle shrinking a world that seems so vast with a click of the mouse.&nbsp;
Something as simple as calling someone you love, or being able to see  your family and friends using the little camera in your Macbook, is  something that  Steve Jobs and Apple have made possible. Thank you Steve. All your stuff ROCKS!!!!! 
Rest in peace. Thanks for all the innovation you made possible. 
For those of us in the technology industry, we will be forever changed my his innovation, drive, and creativity.  And for those of use who had a chance to meet him, however briefly, we can remember a truly unique individual.  You will be missed Steve.... 
Merci pour tout Steve. I have never felt that sad for someone I did not know  before. You invented perfect products that truely revolutionised our lifestyles. I will give my organs when it will be my turn.&nbsp;
People who created something new, who gave to people something that makes their life easier, who gave their life and soul for the benefits of many others are called Great people. Steve as an engineer and manager was, moreover, he is and he will be one of them.  We can say only "Thank you Steve for what you did for all of us". Our memories and acknowledgement to you will be kept in our hearts.  My condolences to Steve's family.&nbsp;
Although this may sound the same again: you have truly changed our lives. Thank you for being an incredible human being, role model, visionare and of course, a fighter. Every time I felt hopeless regarding any aspect of my life, I watched you speech in Stanford. That was absolutely brilliant. I was adopted too and what you said touched me deeply. I was amazed by your words and your attitude regarding difficulties and connecting the dots from things in the past.  Thank you once more, RIP and my prayers to your family.
Steve Jobs is the definition of innovation. Thank you so much.&nbsp;
You laid the foundation to advance us as a civilization- both from a   technology perspective and a human perspective.   
I would like to leave my deepest condolences and prayers go to Steve' s family at this extremely sad time. I know from loosing a family member recently what they are going through.   His legacy will live on with all that he has done and for what he did and what Apple has become.  I would like to thank him for all he has done as I have been a mac user from the original iMac days and wouldn't use anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;
I have no words to express my deep sorrow on the passing of Steve. He has always been an inspiration to me. He was bigger than life and represented what Silicon Valley is all about. I never had the opportunity of meeting or seeing him in person, but have always admired him. He was, and still is my idol. I will miss him. God bless him and his beautiful family.
When the notification popped up on my iPhone, I paused for a second in disbelief. A dark cloud immediately came over me, and I thought to myself why I would feel so deeply saddened for someone I didn't even know. I looked around at my iPad laying on the couch, my briefcase with my MacBook in it, the Apple TV my daughter was practicing her cheerleading on and the iPhone which has changed the way I communicate. I realized that even though I had never had the privilege to meet Steve, he was so intertwined with my life that he had become part of my life. It is a very sad day and my prayers will be with Steve and his family. &nbsp;
I don't know what to say! I feel like i lost a friend, yet ive never met this genius. Rest in Peace Steve, and thanks for overcoming all the challenges in your life to create such a wonderful company with so many innovative products, that have changed the lives of so many.
  Tuning in to Apple product launches has become a regular activity for me in recent years.&nbsp;I would look forward&nbsp;to them like a kid on Christmas morning. Even though I may not have been able to purchase the item on the day it was released or even shortly thereafter - &nbsp;I could dream.     My family and I are the proud owners of IPads, the ITouch and multiple IPods. I have a 4 year old who proudly knows how to use his daddy's IPad and our next laptop will be a Mac.&nbsp;None of this would have occurred without the leadership and vision of Steve Jobs! Thanks Steve and thanks to your family for sharing you with us all these years.&nbsp;
To Steve Jobs Family and his family at Apple...deepest sympathies to each of  you...a true visionary of our century has been lost, but with his hard work  and dedication he will NEVER be forgotten!  Rest Peacefully Steve!
 We will keep you in our hearts and god bless you, we have lost a great man on earth but today the almighty God has gained a great soul.
I want to start with sending my condolences to Steve's family and friends in this difficult time.  I've been working for Apple for almost 4 years now and it has been one of the most enriching and most rewarding carrers I've ever pursued. Working for a company that I love and stand behind, like no other. Even before I started working for Apple Retail, I admired the way Steve grew and developed this company and his ability to present and excite the world with some of the best innovations Apple has ever created. Getting hired by Apple was a dream come true. I am proud to be able to say:  "I work for Steve Jobs," one of the most inspiring leaders, mentors and innovators of our time. He built a company that respects and values its employees and customers in a way I've never seen any other company do. We are reminded of him every day by using the way he taught us to do business.&nbsp;
You've helped make this world a better one. You'll never be forgotten.
He built a following that was built entirely on his close and careful care to always ensure his customers were satisfied with their products. Nobody can or ever will replace a man who has changed the way we learn and consider using technology. RIP Steve Jobs. 
I obviously never knew Steve personally, but as most celebrities and great minds, his impact will be felt until long after many of us have passed as well. Thank you Steve for your amazing contributions to technology throughout your life, surely it would be impossible for millions of people all over the world to forget you when they enjoy a little piece of you every time they press play, make a call, or launch Safari.&nbsp;
I wish to offer my condolences to Steve's family, friends and colleagues. He  changed the world, he was a true visionary and he was a wonderful person that touched so many people all over the world.
I've never met Steve Jobs in person. But everyday I thank him for everything he changed in my life.  Since I started buying Apple products, I had 3 iPods, 2 laptops, one iMac, one iPad, and 3 iPhones. And they made my life easier.  But Steve changed many more. He changed the industry from music to phones. And that wasn't his biggest contribution either.  He was a model for everyone. After I heard his speech on Stanford (the most inspiring ever), I saw how many issues he had on his life, but that wasn't enough to stop him from doing what he wanted. And he changed the world.  Thank you, not only for the amazing stuff you created and made technology simple. Thanks for showing us that you don't have to be a show off to be great. You can do all that on a turtle neck and jeans.
What a terrible loss to a wayward nation. Steve Jobs was an incredible  person with even more incredible ideas. HIs innovation will be missed by  all. I wish I could have met him personally, but his spirit will live on  through his devices and through his consumers. Consumers who will miss  him as if he were family. RIP.
R.I.P Steve Jobs! I couldn't imagine life without my MacBook, iPhone, or my i Pod! You will be missed, you have created a force that will forever improve l ife as we know it. Take care and Thank You for blessing us with your wonderful genius.&nbsp;
Steve thank you for your legacy to our generation and "think different" always keep in  my mind.
Thank you for being with us, bring us brilliant technology evolution, changes the way how we live, bringing happiness to people by your invention.  Rest in peace, Steeve.  Deepest condolences to Steeve's family &amp; friends for their lost of great father, great hunsband and great friend.&nbsp;
To a transformer of the way the world uses and excels in technology, thank you for enabling the generation to open so many doors to new innovations and ideas, for giving aspiring geniuses hope and drive in this life. You were a true legend and the respect that I, many other Mac's, and PCs even, have for you goes above and beyond. Thank you for giving me motivation to chase dreams, no matter how out of this world they may be, you're ideas and dreams put to real life are proof that nothing is impossible. May you rest in the sweetest peace, Steve Jobs.
Steve was a pioneer with a vision to blaze trails none had ever taken. His career has forever changed the way the world communicates. Our thoughts are with his family. God bless.&nbsp;
I met him once in a cafe. Honestly the nicest and smartest man I ever   met. He offered to show me the best thing on the menu. To   this day I still go there and only get that. I love you Mr Jobs,  Farewell
R.I.P Steve Jobs, you were an icon to all people across the world.  And your inventions changed the way we live.&nbsp;
One of the greatest innovators has gone. We'll miss you, Steve.    
There will be just a hand full of people in history that will make us  miss them even when we didn't know them, Mr steve is one of them. I know  he is now happy wherever he is. 
Thank you Apple for creating such magnificent products. Once you go Mac you never go back. Steve Jobs will be remembered, not for his amazing products, but for who  he was. I recently purchased my Mac Book Pro last April, and i must say i have  been wanting it for as long as i can remember. It truly is an amazing  laptop, but it's more. Thank you Apple for the IPod Touch, Ipad 2,  MacBook Pro, IMAC and many more wonderful products. Cheers!&nbsp;
Thank You Steve..... Me and my family will always remember you. Thank You for everything you gave us, your visions, your inspiration, you're ways of never giving up.                                                             Thank You 
My condolences for whole family!!!&nbsp;
Steve We are all remember you, remember everything you have done before for apple for all apple products and employees and fans. please take care of yourself in your world that you going to. We will miss you!
I grew up with Apple products, literally from the beginning. I met Steve  only a few years ago at the opening of the Apple Store on 5th Avenue. He  seemed so young and energetic as he came down the translucent spiral  staircase to his brand new sub-street level masterpiece. Thank you for  everything, Steve. Live Different.
I know what it's like to lose someone close to me well before they should be gone - I was 17 when I lost my mother to cancer. My deepest condolences go out to Steve's family, his friends, and all of those he touched - including all the employees of Apple. It's hard to lose a loved one and a leader and he was too young to go, despite it being his time.  Under Steve's tutelage, Apple brought the world into the era of space-age computing - things that, so far, you'd only seen in Star Trek and other futuristic sci-fi movies.  I remember being in elementary school (late 80s, early 90s), using the early Macintosh computers for programs like LOGO and having it spit giant floppy discs back at me when you didn't turn the lever all the way. And then watching my school district upgrade when Apple put out more products. When I was a sophmore in college, I bought my first iBook with the money I earned from my work-study job. In 2007, after working at UPS for many months to save up the money, I stood in line for 13 hours to be 4th in line for the iPhone - and I got it. I now work in advertising - an industry where the need for digital superiority mandates that Apple products be the *only*option.  I grew up using the products of Steve's imagination and continue to use them to this day and will forever be a loyal Apple fan. He made this world a better place with his innovative spirit and the world is most certainly at a loss.  I hope Steve's family and the Apple family can find peace in this difficult time. My prayers are with you.   Sincerely,&nbsp;
You were the one person I just had to meet, guess I'm late, sorry for being late, and thank you for all that you have done, for the rest of us…  my sincerest condolences to all of you at apple who had the awesome opportunity to know and work with him, and most importantly to his wife and children, remember his words and cherish the time you had.&nbsp;
He was a visionary, he was ahead of his time. it takes great men like him to see the world for not what it is, but for what it can be.  --                            God Bless
Your products have made such an impact on my life and so many of my family and friends. You will be sorely missed. I will pray for you and your family.
There is truly nothing that can be said. This man shaped much so much of  our world that we know of today.
 Our thoughts and prayers are with the Jobs Family. A true innovator will truly be missed.
THANKS Steve Jobs!
 Many thanks to Steve Jobs for creating products which have enabled me   to better live my life as a teacher &amp; to pursue my dream of being an   artist &amp; writer... &amp; hundreds of millions of other people too! I   believe Mr. Jobs stands without equal in our lifetime as a visionary   genius. Certainly, there are other creators of products... many   business managers but not one who possesses the style &amp; dignity that   have made Apple what Apple is... GREAT! 
iPhone and MacBook made my life much better. I'll never forget Steve. Sleep peacefully.
Thank you for reminding us to keep on searching... We always will.. RIP Steve
My mom went to work for Apple when the Apple 2 first came out. We were so excited when you gave her our first computer. Later she worked on the Macintosh program.We were even more excited when you gave her one of the prototypes. It still works today! Thank you for everything you have done for my family by creating this great company.&nbsp;
Greg and I send our thoughts and prayers to Steve's loved ones, He truly was a wonderful man, and he will be greatly missed by so many folks.  He will never be forgotten.  It is time for him to rest now.  Rest in Peace Steve.  
You will be missed greatly. Thanks for all the inspiration for us  designers :) 
Pioneer, visionary, humanitarian.  You will be missed.  Rest in Peace. 
Our hearts, thoughts, prayers go out to the Jobs family.  We were hoping  Steve would be able to beat his illness.  We are a family of six who have lived through the Macintosh generations  beginning with one of the original Apple Macintosh computers.  We  stepped our way up to the PowerBook G4 and now everyone owns their own  Mac computer, everyone has their own iPhone, and everyone has their own  iPod.  We also own an iPad 2.   How wonderful for us to be living during  this innovative time.  How wonderful the contributions Steve Jobs has  made.  His foresight, his intelligence, his management skills will never  be forgotten.  Thank you Steve Jobs. 
I grew up with my dad's Mac in the 80s and remember seeing pictures of Steve. Now I'm at university and whenever I do a presentation on my MacBook I think of Steve's enthusiasm at the Apple Keynotes. I just loved how he loved his work. He showed me how important it is to believe in what you are doing.  Thank you Steve!
 Steve has changed the lives of people all over the world! His legacy will continue! Condolences to his family.&nbsp;
A brilliant success story: An adopted Syrian-American develops a global phenomenon by following his passion.  A loss not only for the technology industry, but for the world of creative thinkers and innovators. May he continue to follow what lay true to him [The word of Gotama Buddha]
I Love you Mr. Steve Jobs! I will always be forever grateful to you. Thank you for making our lives much much easier. Thank you for your works. You are a great and wonderful person. Losing you is like losing a very  good friend. I am very very sad..     My condolences to your family.
The world has lost a incredible mind today.  Steve Jobs was the creative genius of our time and his contributions to society can not be over stated.  His time here was too short, but in that brief time he changed our lives in ways we never imagined were even possible. In that brief time, he gave us technology that we never imagined, but then then couldn't imagine living without. In that brief time, he changed the way we work, the way we play, and the way we interact with others.   In that a brief time, he changed the world, by putting it in the palm of our hands. In that brief time, Steve Jobs taught all of us that our time is limited and not to waste a single precious moment.  A message he preached and practiced!  What an inspiration Steve Jobs has been!&nbsp;
Steve thanks for your life, by your example, and Apple. Peace in your grave.&nbsp;
man i havent done this before but i must say out my first thought  about mr jobs death: this world is getting less intelligent. be in peace
I bought my first Mac in 1988 - a Mac Plus. &nbsp;I've been a devoted MacUser for 23 years. &nbsp;Thank you, Steve for all the innovations. &nbsp;Thank you.  And to the family, my prayers are with you.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs:   You have been an inspiration, and I cannot explain how much you have touched my life sir. Your technologies have undoubtedbly made this world a better place, enhancing the lives of billions. His hard work, passion, and love for Apple is unmeasurable. Steve, your hard work is inspiring and you have become known as the best inventor of our time.  RIP    
There are only  a few people in history that come to radically change  how everyone else thinks about the world they live in. Steve Jobs was  one of those people. 
Thanks for the Oregon Trail breaks in elementary school, the demise of my CD collection in college, and for the entertainment on cross country flights on my iPad in the now. Inspirational how one man can change the world so much and touch so many lives through business.&nbsp;
I just watched a clip of a speech Mr. Jobs gave at a graduation ceremony on Anderson Cooper where he talks about knowing that he will die, possibly soon, and it makes me want to live every day like him. &nbsp;I have always thought that people with a definite end date are the luckiest in the world. &nbsp;They don't have to worry about the unknown. &nbsp;They know that the only thing that counts is what you do today, because you might not get tomorrow. &nbsp;I only hope that yesterday, Steve was well enough to see the release of the iPhone 4s and that he was satisfied with the future of the company. &nbsp; Thank you Mr. Jobs for revolutionizing this world and making it a better place for all of us.&nbsp;
Steve - rest in peace. Truly mission accomplished. Nothing more to do here that you haven't already done in your short life. Hope you continue the same in heaven!&nbsp;
 Thank you Mr. Jobs for making the world of us who work daily with computers a better place, for the elegance of your products and specially their stability.   My thoughts are with your loved ones, friends, and anyone whose life you've touched in one way or another, like you have mine. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs made me love Apple. He brought the company back up and was a great source of inspiration for everyone. The world has indeed lost a great visionary and a genius. It is a sad day for me. I had always wanted to meet Mr. Jobs, now I can only wish that someday we can meet again! My condolences to the Apple family.
you change everything in better, you gave us dreams. Now we can feel that the world will not be the same without you. I miss you so much&nbsp;
Thank you, Steven Jobs.You are a great genius and you made a great company.You created so many incredible product and you lead us into a new time. Now we lost you, but we will remember you forever. 
 You have accompany my business and my inventions  with your ideas,  creativity  and products since more than 20 years.  Thanks!&nbsp;
I remember the joy my first iPod Classic gave me on the go, i remember  how the iPhone made my life so much more simple, and i love how my  MacBook is helping me write material that makes my dreams come true.  Thank you Steve&nbsp;
I will pray for peace of mind and heart for his family. 
First of all my best thoughts go to Steve's family. Steve was to my eyes one of the greatest man of this planet. His way of thinking, his vision, his products literally changed my life. He inspired me and make me realize how PASSION is the most important thing in life.  Thank you for everything you've done Steve. Be sure that your memory will stay forever in our hearts. Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;
Steve gave, hardly took, he focused on what mattered and did it from a spiritual place with passion, directness and vision. All I can do is thank him every time I turn on a Mac or other Apple product on, for enriching my life, heck even making me money as well! But more importantly, helping us, me, do something wonderful to pass forward.&nbsp;
iMourn, iGrieve the passing of a remarkable human being, Steve Jobs.   Thank you for everything - your vision and example. May you rest in  peace and rise in glory.
Thanks for the hard work and technology. We miss you already!! 
Dear Steve,  Thank you for your inspiration. For your ideas. For your genial inventions.  For creating the iMacs, iPhone, iPads and everything Apple.   You did it man. You rocked! You will be missed.
I had never had the pleasure of knowing Steve Jobs but  I was asked a  question on a site recently that asked if I could have dinner with 3  people who would it be. My first choice was Steve Jobs. The man's vision  towards the future allowed him to see the turn of technology before so  many of us could, even  in our wildest dreams. I consider myself an  "Apple Man" to which I can only feel as if that means being a son of  Steve. His passion was our passion. His vision was the twinkle in our  eyes as we gazed at heavens never before seen. I think that if passion  was life then he has lived a thousand lifetimes and in all we should be  envious of him for it, but we should never feel at a loss because that  passion that he exuded was spread in waves throughout the world and that  was what made him such a great man that we could feel. When he stood up  to speak all the world inhaled and held their breaths, our eyes widened  and our hearts soared. Steve wasn't a man that none of us knew. He was a  man that showed us a dream and handed it to us. As we all feel as if  we've lost our father, mentor, friend, let us not forget that passion  that he felt and shared. Let us feel that as we look onward towards the  future and remember him by taking that passion and building a better  world. The one that Steve saw.
Thank you for your best Advise  - "Stay hungry stay foolish" ... RIP Steve. 
It's interesting how in our modern culture we latch on to people we  don't know. When the world lost Princess Diana many acted like they had  lost a close friend. I didn't know Steve Jobs, but I know how he touched  my life. It was in a real, and tangible way. I look at things partially  because he provided many of us the vehicle to travel, to listen and to  see the world and who we have become.
Steve Jobs is one inspiring, motivational, savvy, man. Being only 11 I can speak for my generation, that we haven't known Steve Jobs for the longest time, but in our era he changed the meaning of computer and took the word electronic much further than it has ever been. He has lived a full life and sent a good message to everyone on this planet. Without Mr. Jobs, we would have been several steps back than where we are today. Mr.Jobs surely did "Think Different" and had a confident attitude. RIP Steve Jobs. Our thought go out to your family and friends. &nbsp;
So incredibly sad right now. I heard and I just started crying. I didn't expect that.  These products that he created have changed my life dramatically. And the things that make them work so great for me were the things that he was so passionate about. It wasn't just strategy for him creating that user experience that everyone talks about. A least I don't think so. I think it was love and respect for people. I really believe that. There's something magical about these devices, it's why people love them so much. And I think that magic is steve.
To Steve Job's Family  Apple has contributed so much to the human race electronically. Steve together with others have made our lives much easier to live. We can print, surf the net, compined electronics, etc.  Steve, u will NEVER be forgotten bec of Apple Computers..... &nbsp;
Steve Jobs has had a profound impact on every day of my life as long as I can remember. From experiencing youthful delight using my family's Macintosh Plus when I was a 4 year old to navigating complex and modern unique mental spaces that occupy my day to day work and leisure as an adult, I don't know what I would have done without his profoundly creative vision.  I'm glad he was able to create the Apple of today. His legacy will continue, I'm quite sure of that and look forward to what's yet to come.
I had the great fortune of working for Apple retail for a short period of time. It was the best company I have ever worked for, and was always thrilled when I would receive a company broadcast email from Steve as part of the "team." My wife and daughters can name no other CEO in any company other than Steve. I made sure of that, and they have fallen in line as being Apple fans as well. It's all because of what Steve and the incredible team at Apple have  put together. We will certainly miss Steve and his legacy. Thanks for every thing.&nbsp;
I fell in love with my first MAC in 1987, and have been in love with   Apple ever since.  Steve, your vision of what these products could do   enabled me and millions of others to express our creativity in ways we   once thought unimaginable.  I can think of no greater gift to humanity   than helping us all tap into our limitless potential to make art.    Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I am proud to live in the wonderful world that you have changed.  R.I.P
RIP, our genius master of technological innovation. Though you will truly be missed, you legend will live on forever, and the blessings from what you have taught us will continue to direct us where we advance to for years to come. 
Steve Jobs passing? I can't believe it. I am shocked. I am a news junkie, but I had not heard anything about this!   I feel that I personally have been touched. I loved to hear him speak of his plans. Yes, he had great vision. I really do not have anything to do with Steve, or Apple Computer.   But I own an Apple I-Mac, and I love it!  I am so much older than Steve, but I am not even close to his vision   and intelligence. Steve, may you rest in peace!&nbsp;
The world has lost a true icon. The genius of the great man was only surpass ed by his passion and determination in building a truly world class organiza tion dedicated to giving the world amazing products. He led the way in makin g simple design elegant again. May his soul rest in peace. My condolences to his family.
The world lost a great man today and I am deeply saddened by it. He's been such an inspiration to me in everything that I do. Steve said  "You've got to find what you love". There are 2 things in life that I love, Apple and Music. I am fortunate enough to have worked for Apple and I loved every minute of it, I was hired at the age of 19 and would have stayed until the day I died, but back in July, my singer and I signed a record deal with EMI Worldwide and I had to leave Apple for my other love in life, music. I wanted to let you know and everyone at Apple that when our single "Saving Grace" hits the airwaves, I dedicate it to Steve and the entire Apple Family. You will see us on iTunes in time.
There is only one person in the tech industry that I respect and salute as the legendary The Steve Jobs ....just passed away and I am so sad that can't even explain in words...RIP The one and only GodFather of iGeneration ,the creator of iPod,iPhone,iPad,iMac...world will always remember you....
Although I did not know Steve, upon hearing the news of his death, I felt like I knew him personally.  His inspiration definitely transcended his creative mind and touched the hearts of billions.  The world has truly lost an amazing person.  Keep up the great work, Apple. 
Thanks for bring such an innovator!  You will be truly missed. 
The world has lost an immense human being.  May his life and achievements inspire generations to come.   
I saw him briefly at Apple HQ cafeteria in Cupertino this summer while standing in line waiting to order sushi. I turned around and he was standing right next to me looking me in the face. I was a star struck bright eyed kid lost in a trance unable to look away, smiling ear to ear.  Steve was my idol and my great mentor.  Thank you.  RIP 
Steve made the world more accessible, and somehow, he did it while  revealing more of its own beauty and shine. 
He will be missed by the whole world,  may he rest in peace. 
    RIP, Steve Jobs.     And thank you.
I would like to pay my respects for Steve Jobs's family and all Apple  maniacs throughout the world. I recently became a full Apple user (iPod,  iPhone and iMac) and definitely he was a genius and yet, so simple and  charismatic - that is my feeling about him as a person. It is  unbelievable the coverage of his ideas (i am Brazilian) and the passion  it spread all over the world, that had lost one of its most important  figures. I am trully sorry for his death. I hope Apple as a company can  always and forever be inspired by him.  Already missing his ideas, my best regard for the Apple community
Steve &amp; Apple, Inc., Thank you for all the wonderful years of innovation. For re-inventing Apple at a time when we needed a visionary. You were truly awe-inspiring and unique. In a word...genius. Also, thank you for the Apple stock, it was the one happy surprise that I got to keep from my violent and dreary divorce.  God Bless you!&nbsp;devoted Apple fan since 1983, stockholder since 1992.  
Steve was, in a word, "magical." Sent from one of the many devices Steve Jobs pioneered.     
To the Jobs Family:I was so sad to read of your loss and I would like to extend my sympathies to you. Steve was an inspiration to me and so many other people who come to Silicon Valley- and California - to strike out on their own, with little more than an idea and the belief  that their dreams are not only worth pursuing, but can change the world around them. Steve was the true embodiment of the American dream and his comeback that most in the business world would have thought impossible was only  the first of many- you have no idea how inspiring that is to so many people  who often have nothing but the belief in their dreams and abilities. I know the days ahead will be difficult, but I hope that your grief is abated, even slightly, by all the millions of people who were inspired by him and mourn with you and for your loss. 
Hello,Steve Thanks for bringing us such a convenient apple phone,though I don't have one right now but I am planning to have a one soon. I feel really sorry about your leave. May you have peace in heaven.&nbsp;
To Mr. Jobs' Family and Friends,  I am so sorry for your loss. Mr. Jobs was such a creative man and he did so much for the technology world. Just typing on my MacBook, as I am doing now, shows his contributions not only to my life, but to many around the world. He will surely be missed by many people.&nbsp;
Today I was in history class and we were listing things of our generation and century and all of the listed things were things Steve created. iPads, iPhones, Macs and every thing else and the teacher crossed all those things out and just wrote Steve Jobs huge. Steve was a very big inspirtation to everyone. I would just like to take the time to remember Steve. 
Please accept my condolences for Mr Steve Jobs today. &nbsp;My thoughts goes firstly out to his family but also everyone his visionary ideas changed their way of life, career and way of thinking forever.
One can  hope our necessity to achieve in every way will grow as fast as the vision of Steve Jobs. If so we will always be amazed by what we have available to address our needs and desires.  Thank you Mr. Jobs, technological genius, maybe one of the  contributing architects of our future utopia, a man with a dream and the drive to make it a reality.  Your achievement will be a highlight in the annals of our History.             
Steve Jobs was a creator he knew how to create new things. The world has jus t lost the man that had changed the world of multimedia. May his family acce pt my deepest condolences.
One footnote to Steve Jobs' amazing life was his startup effort between stints at Apple - the NeXt operating system.  My company was an early adopter.  Steve came to speak to us in one of his famous presentations.  When asked how  this system could do what he promised, Steve answered, " It just works.". And it did.  The system was way ahead of its time. One neat feature was the ability to send embedded voice messages by clicking on an icon of lips.  You could also easily edit sound files, rearranging words.  This facilitated the ability to send a spoken urgent command from the CEO to come to his office (totally concocted from prior messages from the CEO).  This little anecdote highlights the fact that Steve brought a spirit of play to his products, a spirit that acknowledged that he was making machines for human beings that helped facilitate human creativity.&nbsp;
Steve, you will always be an inspiration in my life, my ideas and dreams. Rest in Peace, I know God has a special place for you.
It's not often that I genuinely feel sad at the passing of someone I've never met in person, but I can truly say that Steve Jobs' contributions changed my life for the better, and I will miss him.  Thank you, Steve, for everything you gave to your world through your tremendous vision and drive.  
If I could tell him know I would say thank you for doing it your way. We never even knew that we needed the gifts your thinking gave us. You will serve as an inspiration to others. Thank you!!
My heart goes to the Jobs' family, his friends, the Apple employees that worked with/for him, and the millions of people he has touched, like me.  Sad day for the world.&nbsp;
You are the man of these World...  RIP&nbsp;
My first computer was Apple II, I've learned how to program on that machine, and I continue to use products that Steve Jobs and Apple have created over the decades.  But it was more than just great computers that I liked: I became a fan of Steve Jobs ever since he came back to Apple and transformed not only the company, but the entire industry through one brilliant move after another.  It was one of the most fascinating things to behold in my life.  Steve Jobs was and will remain to be one of the greatest hero to me, who literally changed the world I live in for the better. I will miss him greatly.&nbsp;
When I first read the Commencement Speech at Standford University I was amused. This is a savy man I thought. Since that moment I began to admire him. He has been one of the few people I most admired. The death of Steve makes me very unhappy. God bless you! 
My name is Lisa and although I did not personally know Mr Jobs, I  feel this loss deeply. You are right we have loss an incredible  visionary.
You were an amazing inventor and entrepreneur. RIP, you lived an amazing life and made amazing products.
You started by doing your own thing, but soon it became “our” thing.    Thanks for the little changes that pepper our otherwise mundane lives.
May your soul rest in peace Steve.  To the family my deepest condolences. 
Steve Jobs is an amazing innovator and entrepreneur whose legacy has not only inspired me, but countless others throughout the world.  His contribution to society leaves the stepping stones for tomorrow's future leaders and creators to live up to.  He is a risk taker who commands the utmost respect and honor and for that, he will always be remembered.  Thank you Steve for your indelible mark that you leave with us.  You will be sorely missed.
One of the great creative geniuses of our generation .  .  . of history.
I never met nor worked for Mr. Jobs.  I am, however, one who has spent the past twenty years in IT thanks to Steve and his creations.  The Apple II was my first computer, and I have had many Apple products ever since.  As an IT Architect I was motivated to think outside the box to make my designs cleaner and more user-friendly, thanks to Mr. Jobs.  I watched all of his speeches, product releases, etc., and his passion for releasing the very best products was infectious.  He left the world a better place than when he arrived, and I thank him for making computing fun.&nbsp;
We've also lost the iCon of this era. But I'm happy that I could have an  honor to share the same moment with him on the earth even if it's a very  short time.  Thanks, Steve! 
 Dear Steve,        I would personally like to thank you, thank you for being creative and thinking outside of the box, your compassion for an art form that many did not quite comprehend gave us a portrait many could not begin to appreciate. You taught many to believe that with a little drive and a lot of heart you can make anything possible. Through that little bite in a an apple you will be remembered forever as a visionary, a humanitarian, but most of all a pure an utter genius!   Thank you Steve Jobs,  You will be missed.
our deepest condolences, indeed world has lost an amazing human  being..bye Steve &nbsp;
My heart felt condolences go out to his wife and children. The world has lost a great friend. I am fairly new to the Apple world but have grown up with Steve's vision from my early childhood. I am saddened by Steve's departure but he will live on in our hearts forever. He has built a great empire and has bestowed on us great products and tools for young and old so we too, can become genius.  Apple forever!
All,  I wanted to share my thought on how Steve Jobs made me think about things. The way he presented, the way he thinks and how he shares the information was so inspiring. I studied several of his keynotes and public appearances and tried to understand the genius.  I don't think that there is someone around that can match his level and his achievements.  A true hero and unfortunately he will not be able to see his next big masterplan, the new Apple Campus.  I'll miss him....I'll be an Apple fan forever!
Some people are just Apple people. Thankfully, I can say I'm one of them. That tends to happen when the I can distinctly remember the first computer I ever saw as a child carried the logo of a rainbow colored apple with a bite taken out. Fast forward a couple of years and I'm in elementary school and so is the Macintosh. As a child it seemed like every year when I returned to school so did a newer, faster, easier to use Mac. Macintosh II was there to help me learn how to take my Accelerated Reader tests. The first Power Macintosh and it's successors allowed me to learn how to type with PAWS, find Carmen SanDiego, hook my wagon to the Oregon Trail, and explore my creativity with Kidpix.&nbsp;
 I'm really really sad because whole world lost an amazing, brilliant,  genius man. He is the god for the new technology.  I'm speech less after  I heard this horrible news. RIP Steve. For sure, the whole world will  miss you sooo badly.  RIP STEVE   
The Heaven wins a genius.  Thanks Steve Jobs.
I was a hardcore PC fan until Steve Jobs introduced such revolutionary products such as the iPhone and the iPad and now everything I own from laptops to phones is from Apple. Thank you for changing my mind and the worlds Steve.
I'm writing this note using my iPad. You have changed the way we live and use technology. Apple has humanized digital technology and that would not have  been possible without your vision and guidance. You will be greatly missed Mr. Jobs.
You didn't just create products, you understood what technology would mean to people. You will always be an inspiration for everyone to be they best they can. Thank you.
Dear Steve,  You changed the way our generation used technology. You were a true innovator and an engineer in so many ways. You brought us inventions that brought ease into our lives. Inspiration flowed through your veins and reached out to us. Thanks for the iPhone, iTouch, and MacBook Pro that I am using this day! Thank you so much, Steve! I know God has a seat for you up there in Heaven. Rest in peace, Steve!&nbsp;
To have in some small way contributed to Apple under your leadership, is an experience I shall never forget. &nbsp;I shall miss your friendly smile and wave hello every morning in IL01, but most of all I shall miss your genius, your amazing vision and your unparalleled ability to see beyond what is possible. &nbsp;Your spirit will forever leave its indelible mark on Apple and each one of us. &nbsp;Here's to the round pegs in the square holes. &nbsp;Here's to the crazy ones. &nbsp;R.I.P&nbsp;
God obviously needed someone to help Him do things different up there.  Innovate with the angels and keep an eye on my data in your  iCloud...that IS up there in heaven isn't it?  Rest in Blissful Peace.
We are so fortunate to have such a visionary man in control of Apple.  Under the leadership of Steve Jobs, Apple has always been a leader of beautifully engineered devices that are a cross between exacting functionality and beautiful design.  A combination of design and art.  Steve Jobs was truly an engineer and creative genius that has no equal.  May he rest in peace..   
a true revolutionary . . . thank you for the gifts shared.  
I am a 15 year old teenager from southern California who loves Apple and  its products. I have the privilege of saying that I lived through the  Steve Jobs era. I lived through the products that Steve had created.  Although I may not have known Steve I have been influenced by his works.  He has been a great influence in my life. He changed the world of  technology.  Even though I will never get the chance to meet him, I feel  as though I already have, through Apple.
Steve, thanks for all, you were a genius.....we will remember you in each Ipad, Iphone, IPod that we will see now and in the future.
For you helped shaped how we view and use new technology. I grew up  learning on an Mac and I make a living using Apple products. He was  truly a visionary and was sad to hear of his passing. Condolences to his  family and friends as we the Apple community feel we have lost a family  member.
Thank you Steve for making my life so much easier and efficient.  Blessings to you and your family.
When I was 6 years old my father brought home our first computer, an apple 2 plus.  He excitedly put me on his lap and said "this thing is going to change the world!" Two years ago I visited my father, now a father myself. I excidedly showed him pictures of his granddaughter's birth on an iPad exclaiming to him "dad, this thing is gonna change the world!" Thank you Steve Jobs from just one of many MAC families that will miss you and our thoughts and prayers are with your family and loved ones. 
Steve Jobs was many things. He represented the zenith of so many things great men of history aspire to be and achieve. But what strikes me most is that he is the first great man of our generation to be taken too soon.  I cannot imagine how much we've lost with this brilliant light now darkened by the eventuality that waits for us all.  "...The loss of one diminishes me."&nbsp;
Thank you for changed my personal life and my business. You and your  company have inspired me to do better to my patients, employees and  myself.&nbsp;
One of the very sad things about Steve Jobs dying is that his visions   and excitement for the possible gave us a clear sign of what it means   to live.  Whatever his next journey may be I pray that the expression   of his soul continues to live out in those he trusted and loved. 
I can hardly believe that an amazing man like Steve Jobs can one day die and leave our world orphan! He had a huge impact on our lives and the actual world and succeeded in innovating and creating new and amazing technologies, by giving us what we want and understand our needs. Hope he died in peace! Rest in peace Steve, may your soul be amount those living in paradise.
A true inspirational leader has left us and I feel for the Family and the Apple Team. He has changed the life of so many in such a positive way.  I won't ever forget him and his impact on my own life beliefs.&nbsp;
you dared to dream and make it happen. the world has lost today.
Dear Laurene Jobs &amp; Family,   God Needs a App in and for the heaven and he wanted Steve to come to him today and to be in a better place to develop stuff for him.  My Deepest Condolences and my heart and prayers goes out to you and your family first and then to Apple Family.  Steve left us with a legacy and always will be remembered.  God Bless you all.&nbsp;
Since I am greatly saddened as a customer, I can't even imagine how those of you close to Mr. Jobs personally must feel.  My thanks to his genius is enormous &amp; my thoughts are with all of you.  
Dear Steve,  I will never forget your great works eternally.  Thanks Jobs.&nbsp;
I inherited my first computer from my Father-in-Law and Apple 2e (I   hope thats right it was so  long ago 1984). Ever since I have loved   Apple and his work, stuck with the company through the bad times and   sailed with him and the company when he came back! He has given the   world a great gift, that machines are here to help us not hinder us!   Love you and my prayers to all you family and friends.
 Steve,  You will be missed by all who enjoyed your visions and your impact will be felt for years to come.   I never met you, but have admired your genius from a far and i am a devoted Apple fan and consumer of many products which i am sure that will continue for many years.   My condolences to your family and your Apple Family as a whole, we all mourn your passing.
  乔布斯先生：          你好。感谢你创建了苹果，感谢你引领了世界电子市场的风潮，感谢你为这个世界说做的一切。现在你去了，你只不过需要好好地休息了。
 Farewell, Steve Jobs. Thank you for bring apple and its wonderful product to us. Thank you for your great acheivements.  We will never forget you.  May you have a wonderful next life.

People were and are enamored with you and your wonderful creations - both of which will never be forgotten and  now becomes a legacy and a legend. From this day forward, whenever i turn on any of my apple devices i will always think of You!!!&nbsp;

Peace and rest to a man who was a great role model and inspiration to many in and outside of the technical arena.  A visionary and man of great courage who will not be forgotten.  Go in peace.&nbsp;
Good-bye to Steve Jobs... today the world has lost...  an inventor, a creator, an innovator, a humble human being, a role model, a person who has changed our lives... who has made life more enjoyable, more easy... more wonderful!! The world will be different without STEVE JOBS!!! We will all miss him!!&nbsp;
  My heart is deeply hurted with this sad news. Mr Jobs will live forever throughout each fantastic invent developed by Apple.
Apple folks,  Deaths rarely move me to tears, yet this death... so many of my passions have been made accessible because Steve Jobs chose to dream, create then share.   I think this is worth sheding a tear.  Forgive me, if I shed more than one.  I don't know if my world is better, but it is so much cooler!  Steve, thank you, godspeed and may your family, friends, co-workers and employees know the peace that only time can bring.   You thought differently and changed the world.&nbsp;
Es una lastima una persona tan inspiradora como Steve Jobs y con tan grandes logros haiga muerto. Mis mas sinceros pésames para Apple Steve Jobs 1955-2011 
 I'm only sixteen, and I have some Apple products. I really love the proposals, at first was an iPod, then I've had another, and I started to follow the company. Steve jobs, I knew who he was, and could not stop admiring him. He was a visionary, a creative.. and that is admirable. From Argentina, I can only say by being just one more client, that the news had shocked me. In this email I'm sending greetings to the acquaintances, and my appreciation on behalf of many. Today the world is a little less intelligent, because that is what he was. People like him need these words, although they are too weak. He is no more among us, but he is part of a better future. Today is the beginning of a new stage and it is yours, apple. Keep on.            
I can't believe this icon is gone. A true inspiration to all I have learned in my life. I am and always will be everything Apple - all the time. Hats off to you Steve - you changed the world in such a short time on this earth. Thank you for that.&nbsp;
Thank-you Steve.  You leave this place better than when you found it.  Condolences to your family, friends, and the whole Apple community.&nbsp;
 Dear family and close friend of Steve: For me Steve was my hero, i wanted to be like him, he was such a genius he changed the way i see life cause he made apple bigger and gave apple prestige.  I hope Steve wherever he is, feels so proud of all the things that he did cause his death is great lost for everybody i know...this is another sad thank you for all the things and i know i'll never have the chance  RIP Steve Jobs My deepest condolences&nbsp;
Thank you for being a true inspiration, an innovator, a risk-taker, and a dreamer. Your great vision and your belief in excellence will be carried forward. Farewell Steve. 
Several weeks ago I told my children that I consider myself fortunate to have experienced both The Beatles and the vision of Steve Jobs &amp; Apple. They have brought me much happiness over the years.  I remain grateful.
I would just like to share how saddened I was to hear the unfortunate   news.  He didn't know me, but I felt I knew him through watching all   those Keynote presentations.  I have been a Mac fanatic for quite some   time now. Thank you Steve, rest in peace.
Steve Jobs: What a visionary.  The world is such a better place because of Steve.   He will be missed by the entire world! Rest in peace.
VERY SAD DAY FOR HUMAN KIND.&nbsp;
What can I say that has not already been said about Steve Jobs.  I have been in the Computer industry since the 1980's and until about 5  years ago have always been a PC guy.  After watching one of the product  announcements, I decided to try a MacBook Pro.  Wow! I wish I had seen  the value earlier.  Steve obviously saw the future in technology and  what people wanted from technology long before anyone else and had a  passion unlike anyone in this modern day for bringing innovative   products into the market place.  I would place him along side Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell as  a "visionary inventor" that blessed all mankind with his creativity,  passion, vision and drive for perfection.  He will be missed by us all for ever.  May God bless his family, friends and all those close to him.&nbsp;
After using your masterpiece iPhone4 and iPad, my life has been transformed in every respect. In your designed mobile world, I felt inexplicable impression and movement in my heart - you made me happy when identifying information,  reading article &amp; book, listening music and watching motion picture.  Jobs, I could activate fully myself in your beautifully-built-in mobile ecosystem, I never forget your endeavor and philosophy. You showed us what we prepare something for a customer.  Thanks Jobs for making me happy. 
Some words from my hearth. I'll will miss you. So much. You have taught me what really the Design is. I will never forget you. YOU WILL NEVER WALK ALONE. &lt;3 Rest in Peace. 
Thank you Steve,    for creating all the great Macs I’ve been working with for the last 22   years. Thanks for all the innovative ideas that made work easy fun instead of   hard work. Thanks for never giving up in hard times. Thanks for teaching me, that everything is possible, if you love what   you do .
Dear Steve, I will remember you forever and thank you for your contributions to mankind. The mold is broken, there was only one Steve Jobs, a visionary, a great man. Rest in peace brother!
More than one product we use the result of the dedication, concepts and ideas that fans regard as Uncle Steve, not only will the entrepreneur, visionary, but an idol, which showed that a genius does not need a degree but of dedication and by whether the place of his audience. Apple is not just a brand, but is a little Steve that was delivered to each of us. The body will, but it is a myth.&nbsp;
"The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are  the ones that do."  Goodbye, Steve.  The world will miss you.
Steve, If every CEO had your talent, drive and vision, we would be a thriving  country right now. We need more Steve Jobses to bring this country back.  So sad to lose  him. Apple will thrive forever, for it was born from this genius...Steve has laid the foundation.... Apple has only begun to touch the  lives of the world. 1 of a trillion fans!&nbsp;
I remember the Think Different posters! We decorated all of our school's  computer labs with them. I think we need one now with Steve and Woz on  it.  I'd also like to thank Steve for coming back to Apple. The day his  return was announced, I bought stock. I couldn't afford much, but that  stock put my youngest daughter through her four years of college. I  still have nine shares left. Steve's vision and his ability to enable other people's visions changed  the world. Thanks, Steve.
Thank you Steve for everything you have done in Apple. Thank you for the passion and ideas you had and for all your hard work. We lost a genius who made himself and changed the world with his ideas.  we will always miss you. 
I'm sure this will never be read, but I wish to share my deepest thanks to a ll of the employees of apple for relentlessly following mr jobs' vision. I can only imagine the pleasure that must be yours to have shared the amazing ride that was yours to have had and we, the world, ask of you to hold steadfastly to mr jobs' vision; stay hungry, stay foolish.
Peace. Love. Happiness. I will miss you Steve...your genius defined my  generation and childhood. It is ironic that when you passed, most of the  world learned this tragic fact on devices that you invented. 
What a sad sad day. I never met him but he inspired me so much throughout my  life. What he accomplished was akin to the Thomas Edison &amp; Albert Einstein 's of the world and even though it is crazy for someone who has never met him, I felt so sad inside when I found out.  He inspired me to dream about&nbsp;technology in a way that no one else has or probably ever will.  For that I am selfishly sad to here of his passing &amp; think he won't continue to inspire me like he always has.  My prayers are with him and his family tonight. Thank you steve, thank you!
Steve Jobs, we love you. you are a hero. you will not be forgotten. you are a  legend, a revolutionary, a god. you inspire us all to be brave, strong  and creative through everything. Your battle with cancer was well  fought. But in the end, cancer hurt all of us, with taking you, one of  the greatest to ever live. We love you Steve Jobs.  you will always be in our hearts.
Thank you for the best phone the best laptops and tablets. You were a smart man and help us all see the new way of technology. You will be miss but never  forgotten. Anywhere and everywhere you will be remembered. My you rest in peace. Thank you once more Steve.
I am so sadden by the loss of such a wonderful life. Someone who gave so much to the world in so many ways.  RIP Mr. Jobs.
Thank you so much for your contributions to the advancement of the computer age. You will be missed.
RIP: *Steve Jobs (1955-2011)*World Changer*: Never accepting average, Steve Jobs always believed in better. In that he will always be a mentor.  My prayers are with Steve's family and friends during this difficult time.&nbsp;
Back in 1977, when I was 10 years old, I was riding my bike down the Miracle Mile in San Rafael, and saw a neon sign shaped like a rainbow apple.  I stuck my head in and saw my first Apple computer. It has been my trusty sidekick since that day.   Thanks, Steve.   
Jobs&nbsp;My&nbsp;condolences to&nbsp;family, the loss of&nbsp;a&nbsp;great man.&nbsp;What&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;not only&nbsp;his contemporaries&nbsp;but also&nbsp;new generations.&nbsp;We lost&nbsp;a&nbsp;reference, but will perpetuate&nbsp;his legacy&nbsp;through the ages.
i would like to thank steve jobs for all he has done with his ideas from  iPod to iMac. He has shown me that the impossible is possible and that i  would like to thank him. My home is only filled with apple electronics  with iPod nanos, iPod touches, iPads,  mac books, and an iMac. His  products have helped me with my studies and his ideas are probably the  best i have ever heard. 
My thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family. Apple definitely changed my life - for the better. I am grateful. He made the world a better place.
Dear Apple, Steve's family at home and at work:  It was with great sadness that I learned of Steve's passing this   evening. I know he will be missed on a personal and professional level...there   at Apple and out here in the field. His genius has moved all the other professional photographers I know   and have worked with. I hope the company can look ahead and move on solidly without him,   may he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Mis sinceras condolencias a su esposa, hijos, familiares, amigo y compañeros de Apple. Descubrí no hace mucho la magia de la Manzana de Steve, pero cada día hace mi vida más cómoda, entretenida y grata. Que el sello de Steve Jobs se mantenga vivo y se proyecte con fuerza hacia el futuro en el mundo Apple.
Steve Jobs was one of the most innovate, and ingenious men in the world, he will be missed.
Hi,  We have today lost a genius human being who has defined the meaning of   smart technology and how it can change our lives. His knowledge and   thinking was beyond anyone's mind. Because of this visionary mind is   where APPLE stands today. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  I am personally upset and sad because I am a big apple products and   services admirer.  APPLE will never be the same.  Rest in Peace Steve...... 
Steve Jobs gave us the technology revolution. He enriched lives. He left the world a bit better than he found it. We will all forever remember our modern-day da Vinci and Edison.  Steve Jobs changed the world. 
His visions have changed the WORLD.! we will miss him.
Thank your inventions. &nbsp;The world is a better place because you let your innovations be part of  our life and help us become better citizens.
Please accept out heartfelt condolences on this great loss.  With Regards.
I remember Steve wanted to change the world. I will remember him as a guiding inspiration for the rest of my life.  I thank Steve for touching lives everywhere.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has deeply inspired my life.   A true magician.   Deepest condolences to his family, friends and coworkers.
I really appreciate what you did for Cell phone industries, and computers, without your imaginations I don't where my wife would be without her IPhone.     Thank you again, the world will miss you so much for your creativity.&nbsp;
1955 - 2011: "Great stories, great iDeas".&nbsp;
Steve Jobs,  Thank you for teaching me to see, but see with the eyes of those who have nofear of the unimaginable future. Thank you for making all my dreams come true without even knowing what I wanted. Thank you for anticipating the future.  Thanks for everything and see you soon   
As elusive as Steve Jobs was, I feel as if I have lost a dear friend. I love my Apple products. They make my life better. Thank you Steve and my sympathy to his friends and family.
Steve Jobs and Apple changed my work life as photographer literally overnight, from darkrooms with chemicals populated with strange enlarging contraptions to a keyboard and screen. Then you added iTunes and the incredible iPhone plus the iPad and more how you plugged into and imagined what could be, then you were able to realize it. Simply amazing,  thank you for the journey so far.&nbsp;
I send my condolences to his family. Stay strong, stay focused and remember him as a innovator that changed how we use computers! I remembered when the iPod came to the market . It changed the world, music , everything. It was a ground breaker! The Apple family and Steve continued to change how to we use computers, even until his last day! &nbsp;He'll always be remembered! R.I.P MR APPLE &nbsp; &nbsp; (Steve Jobs)
Dear Steve,  You've changed our whole life. Our thinking about technology. The way we communicate. Everything.  Thank You so much,   I salute you!  Rest in Peace.
this world is no longer the same. peace in another world.
It is with very deep sadness that I've learned of the passing of Steve  Jobs.  My heart goes out to his family, as they grieve the loss of their loved  one, a man we all loved and admired for so long.  There are no words to express the sadness I feel in seeing this creative  genius and genuinely good person, leave us much to soon.  Rest in Peace Steve, you will be remembered and honored forever.&nbsp;
Hello.  My name is Adam. I am in high school, and I'm fifteen. Steve Jobs has had an enormous impact on my life. How? I began using computers at the age of four because I loved Apple and Steve Jobs. In eighth grade, I began studying HTML and other computer languages, hoping to be just a little like Steve Jobs. I even began to wear my glasses daily. Every electronic in my house, whether it be a computer, phone, tablet device, or MP3 player, is 100% guaranteed to be Apple. I consider Steve to be my hero and an idol figure to me. I will miss him immensely. You will be missed, Steve. Your company will live on just as you will have wanted it to.
Steve Jobs was a visionary that will forever be remembered in the world  of technology and in our hearts. Though I have never had a chance to know him, I feel his passion through  the products that I currently use on a daily basis. Without his  inspiration and guidance none of the technology today would be available  to me. I have grown up knowing and using the evolution of his work and I will  forever remember him. I know you are in a better place now with no suffering and I hope you  will watch over us from the skies above. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs.
I am deeply sorry for the lost of such a visionary and amazing man that Steve Jobs was. He has changed the world and mine with his innovations  and products. Jobs has made our lives much easier and I hope that his  principles and thoughts that Jobs used in his creations will continue to  thrive in the years to come. I wish the best to the&nbsp;Jobs&nbsp;family and those who were side by side with him.
I write this from a device invented by Steve and Apple. I offer my respects to the whole world (and of course his family and coworkers) because our lives  will never be the same again in the absence of just one great, creative human being: Steve Jobs. Now his atoms will go back to the place we all come from: the stars.
  First and foremost I would like to say that the world wouldnt be the  same without Mr. Jobs he was truly an amazing human being that changed  the world forever. I would like to thank him for the technology he has  placed in my hands for they are a part of my everyday life. You will be  missed Mr. Jobs. My condolences to his family and friends R.I.P Steve  Jobs he will be remembered forever.  
   Steve Jobs has changed so many lives, directly, and indirectly. He was one of the greatest visionaries, if not the greatest. When Steve Jobs was announced no longer alive, it felt as if a part of me has died also. He wasn't just a CEO of a company, but was a influential leader. Steve Jobs is to me, someone to be recognized, someone I have a tremendous amount of respect for. He had something special that sets him apart from other leaders, and that he is a passionate, creative, most devoted man. Today we have lost a great man who has revolutionized technology, and was always a step ahead of everyone. I believe today October 5, 2011 shall be remembered as a sorrowful day of the death of The One and Only, Steve Jobs.
Thank you Steve Jobs. For everything you brought to this world. We love you, and we will miss you.
Thank you Mr. Jobs for making products even more beautiful than jewelry.  I treasure every one.
Somehow I suspected it wouldn't be too much longer before Steve left us.   Even knowing this, I still can't help but feel as if a large part of my  life has just left.  Even though I didn't, and probably never would have  had a chance to know him personally, I can't help but look around my  home and office and know how much he has influenced a large part of my  life and business.  My condolences go out to his family, friends and his adopted family  members that he worked with closely on a day to day basis.  Steve, you will be sorely missed but remembered for many lifetimes to  come. 
Truly a 'revolutionary'. He and his genius will be missed. Our first home computer in the early 80s was an Apple and that opened new horizons - mostly good - for my kids which I never had in my own youth. But more than anything - he is a good, kind person - inspired most likely by his Buddhist values. Steve Jobs rocks!
Dear family and friends of Steve,  I'm so sorry for your loss, Steve has inspired everyone his products have touched. Steve will be missed by the world.
Where to begin? Today passed a true American/Californian/Bay Area hero. Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
Sincerest condolences to everyone that knew, appreciated and loved Steve's work.  He is such an inspiration both in and out of the technology world.  I just wanted to say thanks as well for every amazing Apple device that Steve helped bring to life, and helping stimulate healthy competition.  God Bless all of you.
It has been an honor knowing that every apple device has a part of his soul inside, so he can live forever among us. Thank you for changing the world.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve - generations of New Zealanders to come will be inspired by your achievements
I recently watched a documentary about Steve Job's life and the genesis  of Apple Computers.  I became an Apple user in 1999 and have been one  ever since.  I am grateful to Steve Jobs and the other hard workers at  Apple for making things that work.  I  also recently read something  Steve said about living for your passion and it resonated deeply in me.  Rare people like Steve Jobs are certainly missed but more than that, you  wonder how things would be without their inspiration and innovation.
Our Entire family mourns the death of a great American inventor. Apple has been part of our family since the 80"s.
I was so sad to hear of his death.  I have bought apple products for years.  I feel like he has made all of us have better lives with his products.  I want to send my deepest sympathy to his family.  I feel like I have lost a dear friend even though I really didn't know him.  RIP.  Our country has lost a genius.&nbsp;
I've had dozens of Apples since 1986 and there's never been a rotten one in the bunch. Thanks Steve, you are and will be missed.
Thanks for all the wonderful products you have helped bring to life. The world will always remember you with every keystroke, touch, pinch, zoom and gesture we use on your state of the art IOS devices you helped invent. Our thoughts and prayers go to your loving family. &nbsp;
I just wanted to express my condolences to Mr. Jobs family, friends, and  all the employees at Apple. I heard the news from an app on my iPad,  text some of my friends about it on my iPhone, read the news on my  Macbook air, and am typing this email on my iMac. I use, love, and  appreciate the incredible products that Mr. Jobs and Apple create and as  deeply saddened as I am by the news, I have faith that Apple will  continue to thrive as a company that has and always will make him proud.  I am so sorry for his family's loss. RIP Mr. Jobs. 
Thank you Steve for what you gave us!  RIP 
I don't know where to start. I am so upset that as a nation to lose  a great  business man like him.he was a great example for me. I hope everyone follow  his foot steps. May he rest in peace.
My heart goes out to Steve's family and his friends, he lives on in all our hearts.&nbsp;
There's a piece of Steve in every iPhone, iPad, iPod, Macbook and iMac sold around the world. He will always be remembered. &nbsp;
  I have only had the pleasure of using Apple MacBook, &amp; iPhone for a couple  of years now, but I would just like to say THANK YOU. THANK YOU for being a  visionary, an innovator. THANK YOU for developing products that will continue to have an impact on this world for years to come!    My thoughts and prayers to the Jobs family. Your husband and father was truly an amazing individual!&nbsp;
my deepest condolenses to the family.
The world has lost a great innovator, thinker and genius. Steve Jobs  changed the way we interact and use phones, but above all he greatly  changed the way we live. Rest in Peace
   A wonderful, wonderful man has left us. The world's greatest innovator, marketer, retailer, and artist.  
I am hurt to hear we have lost such an inspiring man in this world.  You  will always be remembered!! RIP Steve. 
To all of Steve's friends and family: Steve was a great man, and you  should feel better if you realize this, he accomplished so much in his  lifetime. He created Apple which is a very successful company that has a  very bright future. He basically played a big part in creating the  future. I personally look at Steve Jobs the same way I look at Albert  Einstien, a pure genius. I wish the best for you and I'm sorry for your  loss. 
I always thought of Steve Jobs as the greatest inventor of all time. His creations, designs, personality, all unique, and all one of a kind. Whenever Steve came out with a new device, you'd think "Man, i'm don't think he can go any further with this" he'd prove you wrong. Like no other human being, he had the thought of only something he could come up with. Steve could turn the odds around just like that. I and many others will miss Steve Jobs. 
Hey Steve, Thanks for guiding us this far. Cant really say how much we will miss you.But you have ignited enough innovation among us.  RIP
I send my regards and wish the best for Steve's family and friends, and  the world has indeed lost a wonderful human being, may he rest in peace. 
Hi, Steve is a great man, a giant in dreams and more importantly, a man with relentless passion in finding and walking the road where dreams become reality. His passing is a loss to all mankind. Deepest condolences to Mrs Jobs and family... the world shares your grief. -&nbsp;
Steve did not follow, he lead the way with technology that he knew was   cool, never trying to figure what the public wanted. I've never owned   other than Mac products and have never been dissapointed. We were all   blessed to live in the era and witness a true visionary. Rest in   Peace, Steve.
Thanks for every thing, this world is proud to know you wrote the most  important page in the history of the best computer technologies!!! Thanks so much and rest in pace up there with father god!!!
Steve Jobs was a creative genius, and he always will be. He made Apple a  success, and his company will forever succeed because of his hard work  and effort. I love Apple, and I always will. He will be missed. I LUV  YOU STEVE JOBS!  
My wife and I would like to extend our sincere condolences to Mr Job's family and the employees of Apple. The world has lost today an amazing human being, who was not only brilliant in what he did but tenacious and hard working and never one to give up.  We mourn his physical passing but his imprint on humanity will live on forever.&nbsp;
He was a visionary beyond imagination and with his work has changed our lives like few other people in recent modern times. I'm certain his loss will be heartfelt all over the world. 
I've been an apple user for twelve years now, and this is definitely a sad day.  We've lost a visionary and I hope you rest in peace.  Thank you for all you've done. 
When I heard Steve Jobs was resigning I was really upset. He was a great person and he had a great life. RIP Steve Jobs 
Steve you've changed the way we view computers and so much more. You'll be deeply missed and I pray that Apple grows stronger with your passing.  My condolences to your family and friends.
Sem dúvida, na data de hoje perdemos uma das maiores e mais brilhantes mentes do mundo, não há muito o que se falar nesse momento somente relembrar os grandes feitos dessa mente brilhante.  desejo grande apoio a família. Morre um mito,  nasce uma lenda.
Sorry for my english. It's late here in Paris, France but I wanted to  write just some words and say I'm sad to learn this loss. I'm just a  french guy fascinated by so much creative man and I'm a real fan of his  work. I'm writing this message from my MacBook, so aware of what Steve  Jobs brought us all. Thank you mister.  Rest in peace.
Most of us that like tech can say that you were the most brilliant person that ever lived. You will never be forgotten by all who have seen the evolution. Thanks for all your genius. R.I.P 
Sin duda un gran cerebro se ah ido al cielo, que desde alla nos mande sus ideas.  Cambio el mundo, nos cambio a todos, y lo que falta por cambiar. Gracias Steve jobs..!!!&nbsp;
 I am writing from Portugal, from an old iPad 1, one of the many fantastic devices Steve Jobs left us with.  Steve, thank you for your legacy! You will always be remembered and you are part of the history now. No one deserves to suffer from that kind of diseases so I want to leave my condolencies to his family and friends. May our God be with you all the time.  Rest in peace.
I was saddened to here of the loss of Steve. His building of Apple has   changed the lives of many people including myself. I utilize Apple   technology daily and I know the pride he felt in the company. So many   innovations have come from his genius. I know he will be greatly missed. My sincere condolences to his family, friends and associates at Apple.  You are in my prayers. 
God lets go of those that are a wonder to the earth and to all human kind. Mr. Jobs continues to live on through his inventions. He will be kept in our minds and in our hearts. Our condolences to his family.&nbsp;
Thank you for all you've done, Steve. The world will never forget you.&nbsp;
 I am deeply sadden by the news I received today and my heart goes out to the family and friends of an extraordinary human, with a great mind and a bigger soul. I can't even imagine how much Steve will be missed, but his legacy will always leave with us...we will soon see beautiful and colorful apple shaped clouds in the sky.     God bless you Steve!&nbsp;
As I sit here typing on my Mac laptop, it's surreal that the man who  made all this possible has died. I cried two years ago when I opened the  iPhone that my sons gave me for Christmas. Some would think I was crazy,  but that, I discovered was the kid in me. I had more fun with that phone  over the Christmas holiday...learning, exploring, creating. Steve  Jobs and Apple have created a whole new world for billions.  We have all been touched by an amazing man. My prayers are with his  family and friends.&nbsp;
I've been crying since your passing. You introduced a new world to me, one that'll never be the same again. You did your thing, man. You went out like a  lion. Wherever you are now, I wanna see it revolutionized by the time I get  there.
My first computer was an Apple IIc. My grandfather gave my mom a thousand dollars and told her she could only spend it on a computer for my brother and I . We were the only kids on the block with a computer in our house. We lived in a poor neighborhood. All the kids would come to my house after school to play on the computer and it kept us from getting into terrible, life changing  trouble elsewhere.  Thank you.&nbsp;
Words seem inadequate to express the sadness we feel right now for the loss of a genius that changed the world not only related to technology but also to the entertainment business.  Thank you Steve for every wonder you created. We will never forget you. Our thoughts are with his family too.
 Steve your dreams and visions changed the world thank you...&nbsp;
 Thank you Steve Jobs.. Rest In Peace.. You will be missed.. Sent from my iPhone 
As many others, I was hoping for miracle.  It's heartbreaking and devastating that you're really gone. You left   us too soon... Thank you thank you so much.....   Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs   
Thanks for you genius and how you helped to take technology to a new  level.. You set the bar high.
We lost one of the most important men on the world... But never we are  going to lost his thoughts... Always in ours memories and soul... We are never  forget you STEVE JOBS FOREVER 
My deepest condolances to a genius visionary and a true inspiration.
I'm sorry to hear Steve Jobs has passed away. I send my condolences to his friends and family. I'm 11 and greatly inspired by him. He is someone that has changed tecnology in an amazing way. And he will always be remembered.  &nbsp;He was also a great inspiration to everyone inculding myself. He has motivated so many others as well. Steve Jobs is remembered and always will be. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thanks, Steve for creating Apple you changed technology by your genius  invention.  RIP, God Bless you.    
I'm a graphic design student from Brazil. Thanks for everything Steve's done to make people aware of how important  design is. &nbsp;Thanks for showing it's not only about technology, but it's about making  thinks easier and more human to use. In the name of all my friends that are also designers, we salute you and  wish a safe journey afterwards.
   Pray for you, the genius in this century. You just light on the PC and open a new life.&nbsp;
I switched from PC to MAC never looking back.  Thank you for an amazing  product and the vision to make the future brighter for all of us.  No  doubt you legacy will live much longer than even you envisioned. 
Dear Apple Family,  Supporting, discussing, and promoting Apple products have been  responsible for my livelihood for all of my professional career. But  that's really a small part of why I owe Steve a great debt. We all owe  Steve not because of what he's done for us in the past few years. We owe  him because of what has happened the last 15 years at Apple will change  our lives forever, or at least the next few hundred years.  I'm grateful to Steve personally and professionally. May God give grace  and peace to you all during this time of mourning. 
Dear Apple,  I would like to extend my condolences and sympathy to the Job's family.  I feel that Mr. Job's  changed the world with his innovative ideas. I  have only bought one computer in my  life and it is an Apple. I am  loving it even though I am still not computer savvy. The world will be a  poorer place without him.
You changed my life and empowered me with yours technology and inspirations.
What a great man. Very inspiring to me. Has made me turn my life around and turn things for the better or me. Very inspiring man, as he struggled to over come his illness. My condolences. God bless.
Thank you Steve Jobs for changing our lives.  You will live forever.&nbsp;
I will severely miss you steve, you have been great inspiration for me. May your soul rest in peace.
Thank you, Steve, for many jobs well done.
To the Jobs Family        We would like to express our deepest condolence to the Jobs Family on the passing of Steve Jobs.....A truly great and visionary man.     His contribution to this world will be remembered forever.&nbsp;
I was asleep when it happened...I woke up to a text from my friend  asking if I'd heard the news -- I was shocked when he told me. Life is  so fragile and can be taken away at any time. My condolences are with  his friends, family, and the people at Apple. May Steve live on forever  in our hearts...
I would just like to thank his family for sharing him with us until the end!
A real down to earth person who had the vision to enable technology for every person to use in the most competitive market. A pure genius who I wish I had met. Love live his memory
Thank you Steve Jobs for all the great things you gave to the world! I   am sure God had a plan for you and you succeeded in all your tasks.    Job well done! God bless you. Rest in Peace.  
My first reaction was that life without Steve will be like like driving  into a concrete wall, but then I realized because of him we could  drive through the wall.  Thank you Steve for changing everything.
My condolences to Steve's family and loved ones, and to us all for this  great loss.  Apple has changed history and revolutionized life as we new  it.  Apple IS the information era.  Thanks to the valuable contributions  of  this great man, a mastermind. &nbsp;Steve, you made a huge difference! You have transcended!!!!&nbsp;
I was impressed by your 2005 commencement Stanford.  Thank you for you &amp; your company product.  Hope you rest in peace. &nbsp;I pray for you and your family.
Thank you for providing the wonderful world technologies. You are my inspiration and the best of mankind in this universe. Your path of success is a learning chapter for people who are seeking to be better and successful.
Thanks for making me interested in technology again, after becoming disinterested in the 90's, my twenties, I became bored of what was happening. With the iPod, and everything else that came after, I saw the quantum leap that only apple was making, and I became a huge steve fan, and maybe more importantly, an apple convert!
I was not always Steve's Jobs' fan, pushing any jealousy aside.  Sometimes I resented his assertion  that his way was the only way, even if he was significantly correct.     If not for Mr. Jobs, computing would have remained a stodgy magic of technical wizards, or worse, the control mechanism for big business. Instead he brought technology into the light, and when it was seen, it was beautiful, useful, and utterly appealing.     I can only hope that his legacy can be continued with his departure, as Humanity was better for his contribution.     So long Steve Jobs and thanks for making the world a better place.
To hear about the passing of Steve Jobs has really put me in a state of pain and mourn. Since 2002 Steve Jobs has been my idol, it wasn't only till last year I realized because of him I wanted to be a technological genius. Apple has lost a valuable piece of the company, the CEO and the mastermind. My dream was to meet Steve Jobs and tell him thank you for making me the person that I am and want to be, but I guess its too late. I will always have Steve Jobs in my heart as I move out of middle school, to high school, to college, and even when I start my own technological company. I know Steve is looking at us from above and will always protect Apple Inc. Steve Jobs: A genius; a mastermind; a visionary MY IDOL! THANK YOU STEVE!
The Schuth household wishes to extend our saddest condolences to the Jobs family. We hope the outpouring of love and respect from around the world helps you through. Our prayers are with Steve, and with you.  Sincerely,   Joanna and William Schuth  --  "I calculated the odds of this succeeding versus the odds I was doing something incredibly stupid...and I went ahead anyway." 
Few words there are to say at the loss we know this day a moment of silence but forever remembrance of a man who realized his dreams  and showed us all how to do the same.   You will be always missed, Steve.   We'll stay hungry and foolish.  
My condolences go out to Mr Jobs' family and friends; The world has lost an amazing person. I would like to thank Steve for all his work in making Apple what it is today. I made the Apple switch (from PC) years ago as a young teenager, and I have never looked back. From starting with a small and simple ipod mini, then moving to an ipod video, ipod classic, ipod touch....and now iphone4; I must say I have never once been disappointed. Same story with my first mac (mac mini) and my now current iMac.   I LOVE Apple, please don't stop doing what you do best, keep up the fantastic work.  Rest in Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
We lost a genius! My sincere condolences to family and Apple.
Technology has lost a genius that changed the world! RIP and Thank You Steve Jobs! 
 I am very sorry to have to send this email to give my condolences to the company I love most in the world and always say that I greatly admired Jobs and bring her into my life his words. My condolecias by Jobs for me and everyone.             
Thank you so much for bringing so many songs, photos, videos and so much pleasure to my life. A true technological genius, businessman extraordinaire, and visionary.   "People don't know what they want until you show it to them".  Thanks 
 We truly have lost a genius.  He was the Einstein or the DaVinci or the Alexander Graham Bell of our life time.  I have two iPods, one iTouch, a Macbook pro and will soon get my second iPhone!  He put the world of my music in my pocket!  Thanks for all you gave us....Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs have been one the most inspiring person I have known in the world  and inspiration have kept going with me in order to be a better professional and a better person.  My condolences go to Steve's family, friends, and to apple.  We are going to miss you forever Steve.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to Steve job's family and his colleagues and  coworkers at the apple family. My prayers and my six year old son's go  to Steve and his great and bigger than life soul.
Steve,   Thank you for changing our lives..you surely be missed!                    REST IN PEACE.
I felt his passion through his products, though he never personally interacted with me, he knew what I and millions of others craved.   I feel privileged to have be around in his lifetime.  Rest in peace Steve.
A man who has made a revolution the computer world has left. A true inspiration and mentor for many people, including me.  Today the world has lost one great visionary. I wish he'll be remembered though history, with the respect he deserves.  My condolences to everyone.
You will be remembered and greatly missed.&nbsp;
We just lost a giant, a visionary, a maker. I doubt any of us will live  to see another, but as promised, he changed the world for the better. I wish his family well; many are mourning and remembering right now. 
There no words for this lose, i've been a fan of apple who is Steve jobs for  a few years. Reading about his past, how he got to where he was is inspiring. I loved hearing his interviews his insight and just hearing him talk. He brought so much to this world and will miss him, every time i hold my iPhone or a Mac its his legacy that im holding. There are no words that i can say to the family, but i cry with them and my prayers go out to them that the Lord may give you strength.&nbsp;
Although I never had the pleasure of meeting steve I feel truly sorry to hear of his passing. It is a reminder to us all how fragile life is, and that we must do everything in our power to make this life count. I truly believe that he did just that. I want to extend my deepest sympathy to all his family, friends, and everyone else that had the privilege of knowing him. I hope Mr. Jobs had a personal relationship with God, so that I might have the privilege of meeting him one day.&nbsp;
God Speed Steve!!!!  Thanks for your brilliance and sharing it with the  world!! 
October 5, 2011  Our thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Jobs' family, friends, co-workers and company in this time of great sorrow. His presence will be missed in the days to come, but we know those who loved him will take comfort in realizing he is at peace and in no pain.  Should there be any service a stranger could offer, you have only to ask, as we would be happy to assist.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve, for all of your brilliant work, and visionary insights, into just what is possible through Imagination, and then making it a   reality!!
 As we mourn the loss of our generations Edison my thoughts and prayers  go out to Steve's wife Laurene and his 4 children. Thank you Steve for  changing my life with your vision. Amy  
 Anyone who's ever used any apple product would never forget how inspiring and inviting his/her experience of using it has been, an ever lasting memory. For those of us in the creative world of design, Steve Jobs has and will always be an inspiring source. May his soul rest in peace. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Steve,            RIP Steve. You will be missed by each and every gadget lover  all over the world. Thank you and love you for all you have given us.&nbsp;
 If anyone takes the pioneer medal, it will be you. You had it all Steve, you had it by passion, ambition &amp; hope.
 This is such a huge loss. As an Apple retail employee, I share the  sadness of all the ones that from the beginning knew that Apple was just  something else, created by a person with no mental boundaries. My  condolences go to his family, friends and all the ones that admired and  cared for him. &nbsp;
Steve, we needed you. You inspire us, younger generation to be perfect in whatever profession we are. To bring forward our best, each time. Man, you were the best of best. You made sense in this world of so much non-sense, every product I've used from Apple, has brought joy to me and my family, we all are a great fan of you. Rest in peace and be sure to come back again, after enough rest. Apple engineers and employees, please do not let Steve's vision tarnish in future.  God bless greatest soul on earth! 
My prayers and thoughts go with Steve's Family. I hope God gives them patience on such a day. They have lost a wonderful man with great vision. He will be always remembered.
I bought my first iMac two years ago and it opened up a universe of   new possibilities in the projects I want to accomplish.  I admire the   beauty and elegance of Apple products and how they merge with function   as ONE.  Steve's ideas changed the world, changed what we thought was   possible.   I feel a sense of loss in "the world" now that you are not   on earth any longer.  Thank you for everything.  We will miss you,   greatly.
The Apple finally fell from the tree. Steve Jobs opened, re-opened, and redefined doors of technology. Creating gadgets to make the human life a simpler  place. To think he was a year younger then my father, brought me to tears. He was a great man and loved what he did. I hope his family feels joy for what he did in his life, not the sad ending. God bless His family and Steve Jobs may his soul finally be at peace. 1955-2011&nbsp;
It's even more depressing when you think that had he lived another 15-20  years; what else would of come out of his brilliant mind.  RIP Steve,  and thank you for the inspiration. 
Steve Jobs was the man whom made the modern technology to the place  where it is today. Without Steve Jobs "smartphones" wouldn't have come so far. Without Steve Jobs "laptops" wouldn't be so fast, thin and look so unik. Without Steve Jobs there would be no tablets yet in the world. Steve Jobs gave just made the best of the best.And last but not least Steve Jobs was the greatest of the greatest persons on earth  What i would have wanted to say to you was that you was "The god of  modern technology and if we didn't have you the world would look  different".  May you Rest In Peace after a successful life full of given to others  you didn't even know.  
You are the greatest man ever. You changed the whole world. We love you  Steve Jobs and won't forget what you have done for us !! 
The world is not going to be the same without you.  Goodbye Steve.
You were simply a genius. Thank you for your legacy. We will miss you Steve.
I am a certified Apple Addict! Thank you, Steve, for creating such  wonderful, innovative products. You will be missed.
Dear Steve,   You have been an inspiration to us all. May you be as luminary in your next life as you have been in this.   Condolences to the family. May you find solace in knowing that Steve was beloved.&nbsp;
 Dear Steve Jobs,  You are the most amazing and creative person in the world. You produce such a smart phone to made a change in our daily life.  I'm sad to heard that you are gone but I know this will do you good by not continue to suffer from your illness. May god be with you and rest in peace. I will always remember you and love you as always.&nbsp;
steve was the guy that made viruses a thing of the past in our home we all will miss you bro
Steve,  Although I didn't quite realize it at the time, I have been a fan of yours since 1980 when I sat down at my first apple computer in 3rd grade to use the "Turtle Draw" program. Today I am an illustrator and compositor, still drawing on my computer, a Mac Pro. You are a personal hero of mine. Your exuberance for life and the design you and your great team at Apple put into your tools and products have enriched my life in so many ways. You will be greatly missed.  Though I never met you I considered you a friend.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs left his mark across the globe. My condolences to his family,  friends, and supporters.&nbsp;
R.I.P. Steve Jobs Your vision, innovation, ethics and tenacity have inspired me as long as I have known of you.  Condolences to his family.&nbsp;
All I have to say is today we lost a man who helped shape the human life more so than almost anyone in recent history. His contributions to modern society will remain unequaled in my mind and minds of many others. I want to send  my condolences to the Jobs family, the Apple family, and all those families  whose lives this man had touched.  The scope and scale of this man will not  be reproduced, and those who will come close will do so inspired by him. Rest in peace, Steve.
We have lost a Genie in IT World! I remember him forever.....&nbsp;
My first Mac was a Mac SE.  I've been in love ever since. Thank you for sharing your vision!&nbsp;
The man that changed the world with his vision. RIP-Steve Jobs&nbsp;
just arrived in office and opened the Apple web site like every morning...my day will be very sad knowing that one of the most representative human being of the Planet is not more with
thank you for sharing your gifts May you rest in peace. God Bless you  and much sympathy to your family and friends and all your Apple family. 
What a legacy he leaves behind!  My deepest condolences to his family and fr iends...and to all the Apple fans in the world.&nbsp;
And thank you for being such an exceptional human being who showed through his entire life what it means to develop his full potential. He was one of the reasons I studied IT and I'm grateful for having shared with my family not only the iPod, iPhone or iPad but his messages on video. His legacy will live forever because he truly changed our lives and made a positive impact in the way technology can help us be better people.     Steve, thanks for helping the world being a better place to live and giving mankind useful and lovable tools. We all love you for that.     My condolences for Steve's family.     So long, Steve, you were a role model and an exceptional human being.
Shock an despair...I am so sad for his family and friends who suffer a  great loss.  Thanks to him, my 3 year old Chase has been mentally  stimulated since 1 years old using an apple phone and enjoying simple  applications.  He has brought such joy and ease to our everyday life.   His brilliant insights and ability to transfer this to historic  technological advancements in communication, will forever live on and  impact the world.  Much love and courage to his family in this time of grief.  Stay strong.&nbsp;
I remember holding the iPhone in my hand for the first time in 2007 and thinking "This is it.  This is what we've been waiting for."   RIP Steven Jobs.  You changed all of our lives forever.&nbsp;
The first computer I ever bought was an Apple  which I still have in storage! I designed my first golf club with it and  went on to get it patented and sell many thousands of them. I have and  use many Apple products  everyday as I'm sure many people around the  world do. I'm sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs and my heart and prayers  go out to his family and friends. He will be forever remembered as an &nbsp;icon and one of the people that COULD...
I never knew Steve Jobs but he had a huge impact on me and my family. We bought our first Apple product, Apple IIE in 1985. We couldn't afford it, but we grabbed onto the future. I and two of my children directly built careers working on Macs. We've all enjoyed the ride and he'll be missed. What an amazing person! We'll never know how much.   Good luck to Apple.&nbsp;
He will be missed and always remembered he was a one of a kind man and  his mark on this world will never be forgotten and his influence has  touched countless people in so many ways Our thoughts and prayers are with his family
Rest in Peace, Steve. Thank you for everything you've provided to the World.  We are definitely better off thanks to your visions. You will be missed, but your legacy will always live on.
The world has lost an illustrious son. 
 When I was 12 my parents bought an Apple ][+.  He may be best known for Mac and iStuff, but that machine  changed my life.  Thank You, Steve.
My condolences go out to the family of Steve Jobs, to those who worked  with and for him, and to his many personal friends.  I thank our Creator  for this mans very existence.  He will be missed.
Apple and the world are going to by different, because you're Apple and Apple is  the world. We're never going to forget you. Rest in peace.
Hi,  I never had the chance to meet Steve Jobs in person, but the sudden realization that I never will just struck me down with the most indescribable sadness. His life was an inspiration to us all, a lesson on chasing our dreams (and catching them), a fire on the shadows of conformism, the proof that true innovation comes from following your own path.  Half the globe away, I found the foothold I needed in his words on Standford to stop wasting my time and start doing what I really wanted: build my own company.  We are still struggling, since dreams are like adventures, and have uncertain destinations. I have been developing for both Mac and iOS for the last few years, out of business and pure pleasure. I hope we can eventually succeed, but if we don't, at least it was worth it. Sometimes the journey alone is worth it, and Steve sure made the Apple road a sight worth seeing.  My condolences to all others, who just like me, have just lost their most beloved flesh and blood hero.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for made my dreams true. 
He's the reason I'm an Apple customer. You'll never be forgotten, and your legacy will live for years to come! The world will feel this loss.  RIP &nbsp;
I am made extremely sad with the news of Steve Jobs' death. I hoped to someday work for Apple and be able to meet him in person. Now I can only hope to follow in his footsteps and bring his name honor. He was 1000 times the visionary any of us will ever be and he reinvented, redesigned, and redefined today's society. R.I.P. Steve Jobs...
I was once an aspiring writer and filmmaker, the products and software that Apple under Steve Jobs have produced have helped me continue to move forward with that aspiration to be, it's Steve Jobs passion that showed me I no longer have to aspire to be, but that I can simply be.  From the bottom of my heart, thank you.&nbsp;
  I was just going through some article today of your passing and came across about your brilliant work with Pixar. I will be forever thankful of your creativeness and ingenuity for setting  a new standard on animated movies. My children for one are fond of pixar movies especially Monster Inc &amp; Toy Story among others. We will be forever grateful of the work that you have done. We're such a fan of Apple and  will always be reminded of your greatness everytime we look at the apple gadgets we have. You're a great genious and an inventor of the modern times. You will be forever miss and will be remembered. Thank you and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve was the best man in the world, he gave us a different vision of  the world and changed our lives. Steve will live forever in  our hearts.
My condolences to the Jobs family, and the Apple family.
History has achieved a new milestone, as the World has lost a genius.
upon hearing the news, my ten year old son asked with a worried look, "who will invent the ipads?" he has touched so many lives. our thoughts and prayers are with his family, his company and his fans.
 A brilliant man, who will never been forgotten. Steve Jobs's legacy is certainly a gift to humanity. Game changer.              
I am really sad, but also happy that maybe people will now understand what he help create.&nbsp;It is a strange mix of feelings.  Working at an Apple reseller in the early nineties was grim. Falling sales, old technology and knee-jerk responses to competitors products were the hallmarks of the Apple product line. There were gems in there, but the future looked bleak. The return of Steve Jobs to Apple marked an almost instant shift in the perception of the company by those who worked hard at selling the product.  I hope Mr. Jobs' passion, diligence and determination will continue through the company he helped create, save and make so prominent in western culture.  To Steve's family and friends, I hope his passing brought relief and closure. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs made my life better through his love of Apple, and it was because of his iMac  and Final Cut Pro that I have such a love for filmmaking. If every CEO were  like Steve Jobs, the world would be a better place and people would be inspired to live creatively every day. Thank you, and God bless your family, friends and everloving Apple family.
The digital generation will truly miss you. Your revolutionary approaches taught us that dreams, if and when persuaded, are the essence of our existence.
My deepest condolences to the Jobs' family and to his closest friends. Steve  will forever live in all the people he's inspired with his brilliant creativity. He's inspired me to express my true creativity and not let anything in  life hold me back.
Deep sympathy to the family and loved ones of Steve Jobs.  An incredible  man to whom the world owes a great deal.  His achievements will never be  overlooked. 
I didn't personally know Steve, but if my life could have only 1% of the  impact his has had on the world, I would be a fortunate human being. My life has been blessed by the gift he gave in his.
As a 63 year old retiree, I feel very blessed to have lived and witnessed the extraordinary era of Steve Jobs and his legacy at Apple Computer.  He had wisdom and vision that was unsurpassed, which touched people the world over.  The message he passed to the graduating class at Stanford University, "Find What You Love," was wonderful and inspiring.  And, it was just him.  Thank you Steve Jobs for all your gifts to us.  Not only a genius in the technoworld and business, but a wonderful human being.  God bless him as he rests in peace.
iSalute Steve. Few are the times the world experiences a loss like this. 
We have lost a wonderful piece of our day! Thanks for the opportunity to say -- so sad! 
Steve is a symbol of hope, a beacon of possibilities, one of my greatest idols. He will be greatly missed and his spirit will live through his words and actions forever.  R.I.P Steve, I miss you already.&nbsp;
To the Families of Mr. Jobs  Families both biological and corporate have suffered a tremendous loss in the passing of Mr. Jobs.  Visionaries and innovators such as Steve Jobs come few to a generation, and he will be dearly missed. That  the technical genius of Apple has improved human life, there can be no doubt.  Thank you for your tireless work and inspired genius.&nbsp;
He is the most amazing person which has really drive the most innovative technology into every human heart in the planet. I have always admired his high fighting spirit to deliver only the most innovative and best products to the whole people in the world. He is really a revolutionary person... Steve rest in peace , let your spirit and innovation be with us till the end of time...&nbsp;
Dear all,  I believe everyone sees Apple as seeing Steve Jobs... we feel his spirits have built in with Apple and whenever we're using Apple, we acknowledge to his existence.  Love Steve Jobs Forever.
You were all what a human being should try to be... to have no limit in  his own capacity !!! &nbsp;Thanks for being
Don't cry, because Steve, now, is in a better place. Now he will create a new "cloud" with God. In every Apple in our hands, we, the world, will remembering you. &nbsp;
I'm so sad more than I could ever say.. Although my English is not good please receive my deeply meaning. I'm IPhone user and I'm very proud of Jobs. You make not only me new world and convenience life but also all over the people. Actually, I was hoping to get better your healthy but...........  With all due respect.. Jobs! I remember you. We remember you. I'll pray where you there in heaven. Good bye, bye Steve Jobs! &nbsp;
The world has lost a truly amazing person today. Words cannot express the loss, he was the mentor and friend I never met but felt close to in my heart. 
There used to be time in my life where I felt lost, didn't know where to go and what to do in my life. That was the time before I knew about Steve Jobs. What he said in Stanford Commencement Speech 2005 gave me guidance and inspiration. The first iPhone I bought, the 3GS, inspired me. I had never seen something so amazing in my life. Steve Jobs have showed me that I can do great things if I love what I do.   Thank you, thank you, thank you, Steve!  To Steve's family, thank you, and be strong, and be proud. My prayer is with you.      
Steve Jobs was a wonderful person and what a gift to this world.  Your products are so elegant and flawless and a bit of you is in each one.  Thank you God for this man, we wish he could have stayed with longer. Please take care of his wife and family and his wonderful Apple.
 You changed my life style, have brought joy to me...Thank you, I'll miss you
My condolences to family , friends, and colleagues of Steve Jobs. I have been an Apple Computer user since the first Mac Plus desktop computer. Thank You Steve for your genius and for the amazing inventiveness that you have contributed to your company and to humanity, you have enriched my life.
 My sincerest condolences to both his family and to his friends at Apple.  The world lost one of its shining lights today. He was a true visionary  in a world sorely lacking in them.
He accomplished so many incredible feats.  Truly incredible.  
We are sorry you have passed and that your time here to do the things you loved was cut short. Thank you for sharing all your creativity and generous imagination with all of us. So many of us have such good feelings from the things you did so well, it's all around us and it has helped millions to be more creative, more efficient, to have fun and always to learn. You inspire us and at the same time you gave us such practical and irresistible dreams.  So many people continue to stand on your shoulders, we created companies, you always made us want to be better..  Peace.
  Steve you change this world forever.... Peace... 
I was one of the people who appeared in the original batch of Switch ads, back in 2002. It was a different time for Apple than today. But  already, back then you could see this was a company in the midst of a  remarkable rebirth, thanks to the creative genius of Steve Jobs. I was  happy to lend a hand when I emailed Apple way-back-when, explaining why  I took a chance and bought that first iMac when I launched my new  company a year earlier. It wasn't just that Steve was the head of a  company that made great products that helped in my own personal rebirth,  building my business into what it is today. Steve set an example for so  many of us: the best way to give a damn about things that matter to you  deeply is to show it with great work that moves and inspires others.  Thank you, Steve. I'll keep giving a damn, putting my own dents in the  universe.&nbsp;
 I am so sorry for hearing his leave. He gave us the great product like ipod and iphone. I wish the apple keep in mind of steve's things.             
Since I started to use the apple products and follow them I wished to find Steve Jobs walking on street, take a photo with him and tell him how much I admire him...So sad that dream will never be real.
Although I never personally met Steve Jobs, I am sitting here tonight with tears since hearing the news.  I have been a dedicated Apple user for 15+ years and as a graphic and web designer, I cannot be more thankful and appreciative to what Steve, his team and everyone from Apple has done to make my job not only easier, but allow me to be faster and more creative.  From using Apple products to just simply visiting the Apple store, the geniuses makes the Apple experience innovative and a one of a kind experience.  A 'family' experience.  My condolences to his family, friends and co-workers.  Steve, you will be greatly missed and always remembered by millions.  Thank you and please be in peace.&nbsp;
Apple under the direction of Steve has been an inspiration for us all to  achieve the unachievable.  I  will never forget Steve and how he changed  the world.  You will be missed and thank you for what you have  accomplished.&nbsp;
Hello, I cannot begin to express how sad I am about Steve's passing. I somehow hoped he'd get back on his feet again and return to us, but it wasn't meant to be.&nbsp; From my 1984 Mac sitting in the corner of my room, waiting to play pong and solitaire, to my Powerbook Duo, to my PPC, my iBook and my current Macbook, these computers have all changed and enhanced my life so much and I am so grateful for Steve's vision and perseverance over the years. Steve Jobs changed the world and made my life so much better for having the ability to make the magic my Macs have made for me over the years. I will always love him. In my heart, he's still the boss and his spirit is still with us in every Mac and everything made on a Mac, like movies and comic books, and magazines, etc. I pray that Apple will keep his visions alive and the company on the same track with visionary products and the "Think Different" attitude that made Apple the great company its become.
All of us, users of Apple products, and also the few that do not have any of its products, share the same feeling as you guys do!  We are all thankful for what Steve and you have been offering to the world and for the new visions that you have been providing to it. Please make sure that you will continue to keep this outstanding work ongoing.
I hereby express my condolences for the passing of Steve Jobs. He shall be remembered both as the great mind and person that he was. May his vision and creations be his everlasting legacy to this world.  Rest in peace Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs' vision enabled everyone to feel like we were actually in the future with such awesome devices. 
Steve was my generations Einstein. My first computer experience was with an Apple 2 when I was in 6th grade in the tiny town of Mount Hope Kansas population 500. It ignited a burning desire that still burns today in me. You will be missed, but never forgotten. Thanks for being different, thank you for being amazing. Your genius was only surpassed by your grace, Gods speed mr Jobs...  Thank you seems so inadequate....
 R.I.P. Mr. Jobs, you have done so much for the tech industry. You will truly be missed. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Steve Jobs, He gave us Lisa, NeXT, Pixar, Mac OSX, iMac, iPhone, iPad and that well  know startup sound "DUNG", just to name a few. This was a man who had a vision  of the future and acted on it, a man who saw what the world needed and gave it  to us, a man who I think wore a black turtleneck, blue jeans and new balance  sneakers everyday of his life. He is and his products will always be legend.  As a role model of mine, he will be missed. 
“Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple.”  I’ll go a step further and say that his spirit will forever be the foundation of many technologies and companies that exist today, exclusive of Apple.  Many of the products developed by competitors that we use today are as good as the are only because of the foresight and vision had by Steve.  We’ll miss Steve and all he did for our world.
Very sad when listening you go away, I am very impressive and graceful what you do for the world's IT. Your speech of "Find what you love" will permanently remain in my mind. Thank Steve, God along with you always.
Few times I've felt like this in my short life. Today humanity has lost  one of its geniuses, one of its heroes. Thank you Steve, I'll always  follow my heart. Thanks for everything. I wish I could have met you even  for a minute. 
He will be missed by everyone!  I'm sending out prayers and warm thoughts to his family and friends, may you find peace in your next place, Steve!  Thank you for all the amazing ideas and products that you have given to us.&nbsp;
His genius changed the world.  My condolences to his family, the Apple family and his friends.   Truly heartbreaking news - few will ever be so missed.  The world will always be grateful for his life.
If I could have only met this amazing man. His legacy will touch generations  to come.  The products have not only developed me professionally but even more so with the education of my children and the many more generations.&nbsp;
Steve, have a great passage. Thank you for updating our world. Apple friends, keep up the good work. I'm sorry for your loss.&nbsp;
I have been looking up to you and your creations since I was 5 years old. I am 24 today. My whole life has been built and shaped by machines that have come together from your visions. My professional life is only possible because of hardware and software that was once just a thought in your head and a vision for a better tomorrow. My personal life is more fun and enjoyable because of your want and need for a personal computer to be exactly that: personal.   I want to keep this short, as I cannot continue to write through the tears. There is no way to describe what impact you have had on my life, as someone that you've never met and will never know, but I thank you for everything that you have done.  Rest in Peace, Steve.  Thank you.
<div>Steve Jobs has changes the way I see tech products. &nbsp;The magnificent iOS is amazing. &nbsp;Its such a shock to know he has left us so soon. &nbsp;I can still remember him releasing iOS5 and iCloud this summer. &nbsp;I pay my tribute to Steve Jobs!</div>
I was introduced to the apple platform in 1989 a year after my son Alex was born. Apple has been the second most  impressionable experience of my life. My condolences to all those who Steve loved and held dear to his heart.  The world will miss you.
I plan on doing a full shut down of the 2 iPhone 4s, iPhone 3G, iPad 2, MacBook Air, and lastly the Mac Mini tonight in my house in a moment of silence for you. Will Apple ever be the same w/o you? I hope so. We can only wait and see. If they keep your memory strong we may end up with even more magical products! &nbsp; &nbsp;
 Thank you for bringing us to a whole new world.&nbsp;
I am honored to be living in the same era as our modern day Leonardo da Vinci.  My daily use of various Apple products has profoundly changed the way I interact with the world. Steve's creative genius is legendary and I can one day look back on this time and say, I witnessed the creations of a true innovator.  Thank you Steve for leaving this earth a better place.
Wow! Just saw the news on Yahoo... Condolences to the Apple family and to his wife, Laurene...May this great mind rest in peace! He touched a lot of lives with his work!&nbsp; 
I'm baffled and speechless upon hearing the loss a great visionary Steve  Jobs. All i can say is that Steve changed the way everyone does things  every where they live and work and he did it better than anyone else.  I  hope that his vision carries on at Apple so that people can live better  lives through products that the world needs not wants. My condolences  and blessings to all of Steve's family and friends.&nbsp;
 Sin duda una gran perdida para mi. Como joven emprendedor siempre tuve como ejemplo su vida y su manera de trabajar y hacer las cosas. Hace 8 años que soy usuario y cliente FIEL de Apple en todos sus productos. Me conmueve mucho su muerte pero me ha dejado mucho ...  GRACIAS Y MIS MEJORES DESEOS DONDE QUIERA QUE ESTES.
Steve inspired a planet and left the world a better place. We remember  him well by emulating the best in his character.
Steve has brought happiness into so many of our lives. He started by showing us all it is ok to think differently. He then went further and showed us that to think different can bring ideas more wonderful than our wildest dreams. His legacy will live through us all as we continue to love and use the products he dreamed up throughout our daily lives. He will never be forgotten for he changed the world while he was living and the world will never be the same without him.
Steve Jobs was truly a man ahead of his times. He will be missed by  everyone whose lives he has had an impact on. 
 I just wanted you to have know that you were truly inspirational to me in so many ways other than technology. You were a revolutionary and pioneer and a marketing genius. Always a market leader an envied in he technology field. You were able to established one of the best brands on the planet and you are a true rags to riches success story. You moved millions of people and inspired an entire generation to do better than what is already out there now. RIP Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Can't believe this actually happened. I thought that a genius like  Steve, a genius who created waves after waves of revolution, would also  be able to defeat the illness with his unprecedented talent. Guess I was  wrong. How I was wrong! But Steve, you know this in your heart: &nbsp;you are never alone no matter where you are. And  you do live forever, not just in the products that you created, but also  in the way how technology is supposed to serve life. I salute you, from  the deepest bottom of my heart. I salute you!
He will be missed, amazing life he lived. 
Una gran pérdida para la industria de uno de los grandes Visionarios en el Mundo de la Computación...  Descanse en Paz...!!!
I honestly am going to miss the man.  He's created so many brilliant things!  Hope your looking down on us. Love- One of the many users of apple products.
I was saddened to learn of Steve's passing today.  I have been an Apple fan and user my whole life.  Steve was a visionary, developing user friendly high tech products.  I will miss him.  The world will miss him.  My prayers are with Steve and his family. 
I am saddened by the loss of Steve Jobs. Please accept my sincerest condolences. &nbsp;- proud Apple Addict since 2001 (complete with Tangerine iMac) 
I am very  sad  and I just want to send my condolences to all of you and let you know that Steve will be in our hearts forever and ever.  Thank you.
The greatness about Steve Jobs, is that he helped to transform science, arts and technology into products, give them lives and delivered them to us. R.I.P. Mr. Jobs. 
He lives on in his products, in his company, and in the inspirational words he has given about the importance of following your passion. Great artists leave us their works, and in this way, live beyond their allotted years. Generations from now, his name will be mentioned with awe. 
If I achieve but 1 percent of what Mr. Jobs has done in his life time I would consider myself a success. My condolences to his family and loved ones. He will be remembered.&nbsp;
 I was saddened to hear that an icon of mine has passed away, however his brilliance and legacy can live on if we emulate and push ourselves to be better and do better.  I'll continue to "think different" because of Steve.  My condolences to the Jobs family, close friends, and the world.&nbsp;
I salute you for sharing your vision and creative genius to us. My family will remember you forever. Condolences to your family. May you rest in peace maestro.
 Thank you Steve for making technology beautiful and fun. You are one of a kind and will always be remembered. Rest in peace.
He has been a great visionary and an amazing person. R.I.P
I was sad when I heard that Steve Jobs died. My idol is Steve Jobs, I want to be like him someday. Steve Jobs thanks for all you have been done on Apple . You are Greatest CEO of Apple.   
Steve Jobs set out to change the world - and succeeded.
Steve Jobs changed the way we live. He drove the personal computer industry, allowing people to communicate with friends and family all over the world. He brought the iPad to the world; a magical device that can allow people with disabilities to communicate better. You have inspired many people, including myself, to create. The devices you have created have allowed filmmakers, programmers, photographers, and many others to express their ideas with the world. Not only have you changed the world for the better, but you have allowed others to do the same. For that and more, we thank you.  My deepest condolences go out to his family and friends.  You've inspired many, Steve, with your beliefs and ideas.  Consider the universe dinged.  
I am beyond grief stricken. An incredible human being has passed on and all of my prayers and condolences go out to his family. We lost a legend today. He will never be forgotten and will live on in our hearts and in the magical things he created to enhance our lives.   The world is a better place having had his presence.   RIP     
Hi Everyone,   I just learned that Steve Jobs passed away today peacefully. I don't know how I will survive. I really miss him. I feel hollow inside. I don't no what else to say except that I am very sad. He a great man and a very unique individual.
Steve Jobs you are one of if not the greatest innovator of our time. May  your creativity an imagination continue to live in Apple. Veni,vidi,  vici. You came, you saw, you conquered. 
Who could have known or envisioned that Steve Jobs would/could create a product, a revolution, a new beginning...&nbsp;Rivaled only by the only other "Apple"....to touch history and humanity...So deeply..... Bless you Steve for sharing a bite of "Your Apple" and awakening Your Dream....... in all of us !
I was a copywriter for 20 yrs, always using Apple.  I continually explained to my now 17-year-old son how much better Apple was far easier to use and less restrictive.  Two Christmases ago, my son did the searching for my new laptop, and my Mom gave it to me for Christmas.  Come Boxing Day with his accumulated money gifts, my son took advantage of the sales.  His first purchase was an Apple laptop.  Once again, Mr. Jobs, thank you for vision and determination.  Hopefully, we'll met in your next incarnation.&nbsp;
Thanks, Steve. You changed my life in many positive ways. You will be missed.  
I know that the world is a bit darker place now that Steve is gone.  I was just thinking what would happen when we lost Mr. Jobs and now I  hear that he died.  I look at what he did for Apple and the world with the things he helped  produce, he reinvented the world we live in time and time again from the  way we use computers, the was movies are made, to the way we interact  with music, movies, and so much more in the world today.  I hope that in the future we can still see the impact of all he had done  and be proud.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for sharing your imagination, your expertise and your true genius with the world. You have changed the way we work, the way we play and the way we live. Your legend will live on through the products and innovations you helped create. You will be greatly a eternally missed.
Rest in Peace, Steve. Thank you for all these wonderful products. 
I'm really sad.I didn't know him but he touched my life in more ways than one.
Hello Steve,  Just wanted to write this down pretending that you may read it, to thank you for giving me hope.  I once saw a video of one of your speeches at Stanford and I still remember some of the things you said, how everything we learn can be used even if what we are doing may seem unrelated, how perseverance and determination can make a person stand out from others, and how the love for something you do can bring a change in the life of millions of people. I appreciate your willingness to share your wisdom, and for letting me know that I may someday live the dreams I pursue.  Hoping we meet someday. 
Steve,     We know you are just archived somewhere in the Time Machine.  Your thoughts and spirit will always be in the memory of Apple and us.&nbsp;
Very saddened to hear the loss of a great man it is amazing how much influence he had on people around the entire world... R.I.P. Mr. Jobs and thank you  for all that you have done you changed the world as we know it
Dream as if we would live forever, live as if we would die tomorrow, that's what I've learned from you.&nbsp;
Well I'm a PC guy who has slowly been converting somewhat to Apple products like my iPod touch, my shuffle and my iPhone. I would like to pass on my condolences to the Job's Family and all the Apple employees who will miss this great man and his vision and passion brought everything Apple to the fore front of computing with their products and excellent service. He was a class act guy in my opinion who will be missed by many... world wide!!&nbsp;
 You are to me a leader of innovation, ingenuity, and most importantly of humanity.  I can not describe you in mere words because a man like you can only be  described in spirit.  My condolences to my fellow brothers and sisters for we have lost one of  the greatest family member today.&nbsp;
The Apple was the first computer system that I learned while in art school. I  never stopped loving them. I remember when I bought my first system-quadra  605, along with a keyboard and monitor. It got me through school.  He was an inspiration, genius and will always be loved and missed!!      
Steve Jobs was a hero to my 12 year old son. My son used to watch all of his  keynotes on YouTube. A better hero you couldn't ask for.
 Steve Jobs is a man that will always be remembered.  He started  an amazing company and shared with the world devices that exceeded the  expectations of consumers and really were 5 years ahead of the  competition.  He was a great man and everyone came to know and love him  for what he is and will forever be in our hearts.
Steve Jobs was a great leader, a good man! His memory will forever live on through his works and relationships.
May Steve's dream and legacy keep us company as the future continues to unfold!
The world has lost a great man today. He will forever be remembered as  an icon and a legend. RIP Steve, you were a great man and you have  changed the world. You have built the best company in the world and have  made Apple a phenomenon. You will truly be missed. October 5th should be  officially named as Steve Jobs Day.  RIP Steve Jobs.
I want to extend my prayers and sympathy to his wife and family. &nbsp;He left such an amazing legacy and was an amazing human.
Thank You for all the tireless hours building technology that we all treasure today! You are an absolute genius.
Dear Steve,  You will stay the best visionary and creative genius forever. Thanks for  all you did. &nbsp;
Merci Mister Jobs.&nbsp;

I've never met Mr. Jobs directly, but I've read so much about him and seen his videos, following news about him and Apple. Though he's somewhere out there faraway, he touched my life. Through his innovations, his thoughts, he has changed the world I live in. It's very saddening hearing Mr. Jobs has passed away, but his legacy will live on and the world will always remember him. Farewell Mr. Steve Jobs, may your soul rest in peace.
We will always be your&nbsp;followers and may you rest in peace in the Heaven . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
My thoughts and prayers are with his family and Apple.  My condolences.  Rest in peace Steve Jobs.
It feels like the John Lennon of technology has passed away...&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to a genius and his family, so sad to have lost such an inspiring and inteligent human being. RIP Steve.
Apple,  Please send my regards to Steve Job's family, friends and colleagues. Here in the Philippines, we were a late bloomer in terms of Apple products. But since having a Macbook, original Iphone, Iphone 3GS and iPhone 4, it changed the way we live our lives. Again, my deepest condolences to one of the GREATEST MINDS in HISTORY
I am sixteen years old and a definite Apple enthusiast. Though I have not be en around to see Apple grow over the years, I consider Steve an inspiration f or everybody who wants to truly make a difference in the world in which we live. I believe his enthusiasm and inspiration will live well into the future  of Apple.&nbsp;
RIP Steve jobs and thank you for your vision and amazing team at Apple.&nbsp;

 Steve was one of the best of his generation. He will be missed not only by Apple but also America will miss his enthusiasm and the products that he so well made. 
It feels like John Lennon just died again. 
 Steve jobs was the Walt Disney of my generation brought my imagination with iPod iPhone and all my Mac products. He was a great inventor but an even better man. I don't think anyone will ever invent so many things. R.I.P. Mr Jobs.
Mr. Jobs,     Thank you for your contributions to make this a better world for ALL of us.     All the best to his family.
For all the years I've worked on Apple products I've been aware that I have been privileged to use one of the greatest industrial designs ever achieved.  A constant source of excitement and pleasure from the sheer beauty of the way the software worked with the hardware and how they have both grown together over the years.  I'm sure that those of you who worked directly with him will feel his loss most. But how grand it must be to know that your work is beloved and relied upon around the world. And I'm sure that Apple will continue to grow in the years to come.  I'm grateful for what there has been and look forward to what comes next. A great man. And a great loss.  My thoughts are with all of you at Apple.&nbsp;
Thanks for everything you had created and inspirations. You'll always be living in my memory.&nbsp;
 You are a visionary. You try to see good when things get scary. You speak with wisdom and grace. No matter what, there is no trace of arrogance on your face. You may not have noticed, but man, you can teach. And you certainly reached many people with your speech. You spoke of following dreams, of life and death situations. Some things may seem impossible. But all one needs is dedication. And what you said about connecting the dots I sure liked that a lot You give people hope. No matter how steep the slope. And that why we're gonna get up and go. We'll reach high. Because I hope you know that your stories of the past have touched the future and nobody lasts so people lets get out of this stupor and go. Thank you Steve Jobs, your wisdom will always be remembered.             
I shall never forget what you did for this world. 
We offer our most sincere condolences to Mr. Jobs' family. Steve Jobs is a great source of inspiration to all computer programmers and for all who love working and playing with computers. He is the true embodiment of the American passion for invention and innovation.&nbsp;
Thanks! it's all i have to say to Steve, thanks for change my life, thanks for teach us to think different, thanks for All.&nbsp;
Gracias Steve por tener la visión y capacidad para lograr posicionar aparatos tecnológicos que hace 20 años distaban de tener una solida base para instalarse en el mercado global. 
Steve,  Thank you. You were willing to dare mighty things. I hope that one day I can thank you for the inspiration you've been to me as young entrepreneur. You will not be forgotten.
I am simply a fan of Apple and, more importantly, Steve Jobs. His  passing is a crushing blow to countless millions of people. His passion  and creative genius made him more known, revered, and loved than many of  today's celebrities. I just wish to send my condolences to all those who  had the privilege of meeting, working, or sharing their lives with  Steve. The world is rocking on its heels. 
 Im a very young adult and without what you did, I would have  never have been even as close to where I am now.    THANK YOU STEVE JOBS
Thank you for making the world a better place, for advancing humanity.
As I sit here typing this I can't believe he is really gone.  Although, it was clear that the end was near;  there is no way to prepare for the loss of a man like Steve Jobs. His brilliance will always be remembered.  56 is far too young.   I am truly heartbroken. I thank Steve Jobs and the whole Apple family for bringing me so much happiness through your products and your vision.
You have inspired me as a business man to keep going and not do the status quo.   I'm happy to say I am one of the crazy ones....just like you.
I can say with all honesty that I would be doing NOTHING that I do today, with the ability I have to do it, with the human passion that it encourages, without the vision of Steve Jobs. I am at a loss beyond comprehension.
 Dear Jobs Family and Apple Employees,  It is extremely sad and devastating to hear of Steve Job leaving the  world.  He changed the world in so many ways and I am certain he had much  more to give - and yet he passed away at age of only 56. Immense  accomplishments and an amazing human being. His 2005 Stanford speech is  still vivid in my memory and ringing in my ears. May his family be well  and his soul rest in peace. God bless him.
Thank you Steve.  I'm going to miss you.
I feared this day would come. I am filled with sadness.  I grew up using an Apple II gs Woz Edition. We had Apple II ce in  school.  The image writer II shook the table it was on when it printed. several  PowerBooks and MacMinis, MacPros, and iBooks laterE280A6  I now own an i5 MacBook Air, iPad 2, and iPod 4G.  I've owned just about  everything in between for the past 20 years.  Right after I received my MacBook Air, just this past month - I had  written directly to Steve telling him what a home run this Mac was.  I hope he, or someone- read it before he left us. If not; I still can  say this man has motivated me since 1984 as a seven-year-old child.  May Steven Paul Jobs rest in peace forever. Nobody has influenced me  more.&nbsp;
Never once have I used an iPhone or even held and iPod in my hands, and I'm confused to high heavens by Macs, but I have always admired Steve Jobs. He is a true technological innovator and someone who I aspire to be like. Steve has been an inspiration to even me, a 13 year-old PC for life.   Forever in our memories and hearts.  Thank you so much for everything, Mr. Jobs. 
Just here to share my sorrow and send condolences  from me, my friends  and family from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We'll miss you Steve.
It is only those with exceptional talents that seem to die young.  To Steve's family, strength and joyous memories.&nbsp;
I was introduced to my first computer, and apple II when i was 12 years  old at my uncles house and have been a computer geek and mac lover ever  since.  I may not always agree with a policy or a plan but i cannot  dismiss how much change has transpired because of Steve's vision and  leadership.  He was an amazing man that is in short supply in this world  and his impact will be felt for generations to come.  I am truly sorry  for his families loss and for apple's loss.
Steve was an amazing person, a remarkable genius; the world will miss  him very much. Please follow with his invaluable legacy. Thanks all the joy and satisfaction that we get from the Apple products in our work and in the free time.
Steve, you will be missed.  But the world is a better place because of you and you will probably be thinking of ways to make heaven better.
Dear Steve,  I have been a fan since I purchased my first computer, a Mac SE in my graduate school days. You have inspired our generation to follow our dreams and to make a difference in our world. You showed me faith, passion, courage, resilience, and perseverance as you created magic again and again in your pursuits.  I will miss you immensely. Thank you Steve.
Steve Jobs was a great man. At the time of his death, neither him nor   us know exactly how his company will affect us in the future. One   thing is for sure though, and that is that Apple has changed the way   we listen to music, socialize, and stay connected through the world   while at home, in the car, or just any where out in this world. He   will be deeply missed, and condolences are sent out to his family and   friends. Rest In Peace, Steve.  
 Que feo es tener que decir adios, nunca olvidaré la primera vez que manejé una computadora de Apple y en cuanto ha beneficiado mi vida, Grande Jobs!&nbsp;
Although I'm sure many are writing similar&nbsp;e-mails I want to remember  Steve not for the amazing products, culture, and company he created but  for showing the amazing capacity of what one person can do with their  life in a single lifetime, and in his case that life was cut short.  This should serve as an inspiration to&nbsp;all who have a dream, and want to  achieve it.&nbsp;I will miss that inspiration that came from him. 
Thank you for your vision.  Taken too soon.
Steve Jobs created a company that changed people's lives  and set the benchmark for design-led technology.  As a graphic designer who has used Apple products most of my working  life  it feels a bit like a death in the family.  I hope that Apple honour Steve by continuing to be the revolutionary  company he imagined  and the trusted partner to the creative community around the world&nbsp;
This world is ever changed for the better because you graced time - with all our love and gratitude.
Dear Apple,  Sorry to hear about Steve's sad demise. He was truly a visionary and was one of my role models.
I can't believe he is gone. He created and helped create so many things I use today years past RIP&nbsp;
Steve Jobs changed my life. There is rarely a moment in the day when I  am more than a few minutes away from a product that he was responsible  for conceiving, innovating or introducing from my Mac to my iPhone to my  iPad to my Apple TV and to the software that runs all of them. He has  improved the way I do my job, communicate with my friends and family,  produce my podcast, share my photos, listen to music and watch TV. I  will miss Steve Jobs greatly.
Your unparalleled vision will echo in eternity. Thank you for changing the world, and making it a better place. Thank you for putting smiles on millions  on faces. Thank you for being Steve Jobs. You will be missed.
Ever since I first opened the lid of an Apple IIe in the early 1980s, I have been a fan of Steve Jobs. May he now continue to guide the Apple computer company from Spirit, and may the execs now in charge of his legacy learn to listen for his guidance through their intuition.&nbsp;
I lost my HERO. Steve Jobs. He is an amazing, genius and professional. He is the Man. Who change the world of technology. Deep Condolance from me&nbsp;
The lump in my throat makes it impossible to swallow, just  as I believe  that such a remarkable spirt is really gone.  Steve until then!&nbsp;
         Thank you for giving us all that you have. We will miss you a lot. I regret that I never had the pleasure of meeting you. Apple will always be the world’s most innovative company thanks to you.  Rest in Peace.
 May your soul rest in peace... You will always be remembered as the father of new age technology...            
He didn't know me. I didn't know him. But he spent his life relentlessly pursuing perfection so that my life was more highly designed. His products care most about people. May his imprint be eternal and, like him, may we all find ways to positively move this world forward.&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened by the passing of Steve Jobs. I have loved Apple's  products since my first introduction to the Macintosh Plus at the School  of Design at North Carolina State University in 1982. In Steve Job's  leadership at Apple, Next and Pixar, his dedication and insistence to  always do things the best way possible, and to produce the absolutely  best products possible stand out as a stellar achievement and a model  for others in all fields of endeavor. We will miss you, Steve. &nbsp;
Steve is one of those people who left a true impact on the earth. He changed many things; made the technology what it is today. I look up to Steve Jobs as a role model, with not just who he was, a major figure in Apple, but what he did - create incredible technology. Please bless him and may he be remembered forever.
 Thanks Steve Jobs. &nbsp; A great fish of the river. &nbsp;Your brilliance shall guide us through the dark ways of the unknown technology and your revolutionary work will never be forgotten...            
Rest in Peace, our thoughts and prayers are out to Steve and his family.    Thank you for all you did, and your commitment to excellence.  The  world is absolutely a better place due to his ingenuity, leadership, and  innovation.
It is very hard to write this letter.  Everything what Steve Jobs was and what he did will keep inspiring all of us.
Ainda nao acredito!!! Nunca perdi ninguem da familia proximo a mim, mas com a  morte dele, que sensacao estranha! Perdemos uma pessoa extremamente inteligente! Fantastica! A Apple nunca mas sera a mesma, todos sabem! O mundo da tecnologia tambem nao. Nada! Impossivel acreditar... Sera que aconteceu mesmo?
My&nbsp;condolence to Steve Job's family.&nbsp;  Mr. Steve Job was a great man, he created an amazing company, Apple Inc.&nbsp;  May he rest in peace. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
It was one of my dreams to meet Steve Jobs one day. But I guess his work will always be around to remind me of him and inspire me no end.  Rest in Peace Steve. The greatest and The Simplest visionary of our times.
My sincerest condolences go out to Steve's family and friends. Steve Jobs   was an inspiration to me, he created a company like no other, one that   other manufacturers seriously envied. He put the smartphone on the map and   reinvented the MP3 player. A true genius and one that will always be   remembered and respected by me.  Rest In Peace Steve.
Today is a very sad day because we've lost one of the most creative minds of our time. Steve Jobs gave us all hope that if we had passion, drive, and curiosity everything was possible. Nobody will be able to replace Steve Jobs.  He will always be in my thoughts when I use my Mac, iPod, and iPhone, devices that only a genius could of thought of.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his family.  A big hug for everything that you did.
I'm twelve years old. The first time I actually heard of Steve Jobs was one year ago. It was when my dad showed me Steve Jobs' speech to the Stanford graduation class. I watched the speech and asked who that guy was. My dad replied, "Steve Jobs". At the time, I had just gotten my iPod Touch and absolutely worshiped it with all my life. When my dad replied that he was the founder of Apple, I screamed. I couldn't believe that I hadn't known this guy until now.&nbsp; Now that he has passed away, I think that this day will be one to go into the history books. "The Founding of Apple", the heading would say, and below that, "The Man Behind the Magic: Steve Jobs". This man will always be remembered for his great innovations.&nbsp;  RIP Steve Jobs.
I didn't always know about Steve Jobs, but once I did, there was no looking back. Even from afar his charisma, personality, and genius seem to consume you in awe. His contribution to technology past, present, and future is immeasurable and  he will be missed dearly. Best wishes for his family who has to live with the loss much more than we.I sincerely hope that Apple never forgets his "simple" touch. Continue to in spire and innovate, I'm sure that's what Steve would have wanted.  Thank you  Steve Jobs.
I must say. As a 14 year old boy, Steve was my hero. He convinced me to get majorly into computers. I idolized the turtle neck and jeans look. Steve was one of the few people I looked up to majorly. It comes to me with great sadness to find the news that he has died. During my school days, I would smuggle my iPod just to listen in on his key notes.   Thank you for your time&nbsp;
We are really sorry for the loss of a great man, and we hope the work he did in this world will continue, and so everything he did will continue and he, looking from the other world, will be happy that his effort wasn't done for nothing.
My apple devices will have a deep tie to the fallen innovator R.I.P.  
My heart is saddened for the loss of this talented soul.
My condolences to all Apple and PIXAR staff, all Apple Fans and people like me who had been inspired by Steve to live with no regrets.
Our deepest condolences to all at Apple and to the Jobs family. He was probably the greatest entrepreneur of the last century. He changed us all.&nbsp;
Rest in peace.  Thoughts and prayers to the family and friends and all the lives that he touched.  The world will miss Mr. Jobs' creativity. 
Hello Steve,  I always regard you as my mentor. Thanks for all your wisdom and inspiration. I'll do my best to make this world a little better in my own capacity.  Godspeed Steve.   Thanks for everything.
As one who recently purchased a Macbook Pro, I never cease to be amazed  by all the unique things this computer can do - kind of like if I can  think it my Pro can likely do it. Can't imagine how a human becomes  neurologically wired with the innovative mind that Steve Jobs employed.  Hopefully he would be pleased knowing that every Apple product in the  hands of someone doing good and trying to better the human race is an  extension of handiwork living on. You will be profoundly and sorely missed, Steve Jobs.
I still have my 128K mac.  Thanks for every new product since.
Steve Jobs to me was an American icon and a genius.  He absolutely  revolutionized America and all technology we use today.  The pure  existence of a personal computer can be attributed to Steve Jobs.   Everything Steve Jobs and Apple created revolutionized technology and  the way society functions on a day to day basis.   Steve Jobs was an  American Icon and his legacy will always live on.  Steve Jobs was a  genius, a visionary, a legend.&nbsp;
Thank you for founding such an amazing company!  Thank you for creating such innovative products that were not only  practical but beautiful and sexy and we all wanted to be seen carrying  them. &nbsp;I remember when I got my first Mac, my first iPod, my first iPhone, my  first iPad. I had such excitement, such anticipation to get my hands on  them. You changed the way we looked at those products. They were not  just a computer, just a phone, or just a music player. They were part of  us, part of our identity and you were in all of them. A piece of you  stayed with those products. They were your ideas, your dreams come true.  Your passion was what made those products amazing. Your dedication to  the company is what made it so successful. &nbsp;Your legacy will live on and Apple will be remembered as the greatest  company that was made successful by the greatest person and CEO an  american company has ever seen.  Nothing of course will ever be the same. I'm just glad that I was part  of it while you were still there overseeing every detail. You made me a  Apple fan. An Apple fan I will forever remain. &nbsp;I'm so sorry to see you go. You were not done. I'm sure you had many  great ideas to come. I wish you would've stayed longer. To your family I give my deepest condolences, for you were more than  just an icon to them. May your soul rest in peace. You will be forever  remember by all of us who love Apple.
Steve Jobs was more than the creator of apple for me he was a  inspiration to make technological advances in life.  He is my idol. I've  always bought the products he has made He was the reason why I love  computers and technology!  He will always be in my heart as a incredible  person who has done magnificent things in life.  But with his death has  motivated me to become like him and make products better than ever!    RIP Steve Jobs You will always be remembered   Hope to be like you one day and plan on it.
Thank you very much for all the products. Thank you for the Macintosh, iPod, iPhone and iPad. Thanks to you I started my career as an iPhone developer.  May your soul rest in peace. My deep condolences. The world will remember you.
I feel like a thank you is in order... especially one "sent from my iPhone." thanks steve.
We all wish for greatness but few achieve it. You did and are the   reason I fell in love with Apple. I will be praying for your family   and loved ones. RIP 
I never met Steve but I have owned Apple products since I bought my first Apple II.I've had and loved them all. Steve revolutionized computing, music, phones, digital capture and digital cinema cameras. Thanks for all you have given to me, my family, my life, my work and the world. The world was, is and will be a better place because of Steve Jobs. My heart goes out to his wife and children in this time of sadness.You were a true genius. Thanks!
Although you are probably receiving A TON of emails, I would like to say sorry for the loss, and that Steve built an amazing foundation for the modern world. I have never had the pleasure of meeting him, be it that I am only fourteen, but I am truly sorry about the loss.
Dear Steve,  You are a shining star forever in our lives.  You have given so  much to the world. God truly knows.  A special place awaits for you for a job well done!
It's truly a sad day for mankind.  My first computer was an Apple IIE.  Perhaps, my last computer will also be an Apple as well.  Something so complicated, was presented to us in such a simple way.  That is Steve Jobs.
Gracias por todas las cosas que nos has dado. Sin ti la informatica no hubiera sido jamas lo que es hoy en dia. Hasta pronto Steve!  Thank you, thank you for everything you gave us. Without you the  computer, as we know it today would not have been possible.See you soon Steve!   
R.I.P Steve Jobs. Thanks for Apple. Would be lost without it.
I am deeply appreciative of the profound effect Steve Jobs has had on the world in such a variety of areas. Many will try, likely through Steve's own inspiration, but none will replace him.  I am most saddened for the Jobs family and wish them peace and comfort in their loss.  Having lost my own incredible mother only a short time ago, I know well how they must feel.  My sincerest wishes.&nbsp;
   The world is a better place because Steve has gone through it.  Heroes are never forgotten, this is why you will be eternal for us.  
A legend has passed away, we will miss him a lot a lot, dear Jobs...you  have upgraded the world with some series of revolutions. Thanks and may  the God bless you.
Growing up in Silicon Valley, I had the fortune of seeing the computing industry develop.  I touched my 1st keyboard at 8-years old in 1972 and fell in love with computers.  It was such an exciting time to see all the players, especially Apple battle it out and make their own unique products.  You were such a tremendous influence to all of us in the computing industry.   We owe you for the inspiration that drives us all   We saw you through thick and thin but were always behind you.  You have touched us all.  We are all better people for having known you.  You stuck to your vision and did it your way.  I work in a IT Consulting Firm but am the consultant who get's all the Apple calls.   I will continue to be an Apple Evangellist as I truely believe in your vision. ﻿ May the Sun always warm your Face.  Aloha, Steve.&nbsp;
I'm a small business owner, this business, my business is my life, doesn't matter if is computers or a small restaurant, a dream is a dream, a man without a dream is an empty shell, i respect you steve, respect what you did for all of us, God speed! i'm sure you are able to dream again in a different place or maybe doing it all over again, i wish that's what Heaven is or should be. See you again
First I would like to send my heartfelt condolences to Steve's family. He will be missed by so many. Steve touched so many lives with his creativity and his never give up attitude. Steve was a GREAT man!!!!
GOD Bless The great Man. You will live in our hearts forever and for the vision. RIP&nbsp;
 Steve,   Rest in peace you talented man.  As someone once said, I never thought a company could be my soul mate.   Thank you for bringing that extra bit of light into our lives.&nbsp;
Thank you for all you've done and all that will happen thanks to you. 
Dear Steve's family and friends,  Be comforted because he saw and planted a future that now is a reality for all of us.  He surely shared love of work, and appreciation of his talents - not letting them go dormant or rest in his laurels.  Like a sparrow, now gone, yet he will still be here inspiring others to share the goodness of these marvelous gadgets and software that he help perfect. Steve take with you our appreciation for a job well done.&nbsp;
It's amazing yet crazy to think that I'm typing this email on an invention by the man himself. I remember I got my first MacBook and absolutely could not return to a PC. He's an inspiration for future businessmen and women, future inventors and everyone. May he rest in piece.  Thank you Steve Jobs for this black illuminated keyboard, my anti-glare screen and the quality Apple provides.
Memory Eternal to all those who are close to him. He brought forth a revolution in technology and he will be remembered for it. May God Grant him Peace.&nbsp;
Dear Mrs. Jobs, his children, his friends and employees,  My sincere sympathy goes to you. When learning of Mr. Jobs passing, my heart  dropped to the floor. He made geek awesome and he made this world a better place. God bless him, God must of needed a iPad personally delivered, I will miss him.   God bless, with my deepest sympathy.
What a superb genius and an icon of business, productivity and creativity.  May he continue to inspire legions. His memories will outlive him.&nbsp;
The world is a little less elegant tonight.   I only saw Steve in person once -- when the Apple II first came out.   It took a while for me to work my way to through the large crowd surrounding the small table with the Apple II on it (there were no crowds at any of the other display tables).   My condolences to his family. 
Steve Jobs -Rest in Peace, there can be only one Steve Jobs....  RMM 
Remember that inspiring speech in Standford? I can never forget your encouragement. It is the first time I yearned to be a leader of my own life. Thank you so much!&nbsp;
 STEVE was the person that make see more than i could ever see in all my life, his passion , the ideas that gave to the world were unique, for him billions of persons will be happy for many years in the future, he make a company that change the way to do movies , he gave helped to make the atari ¡that was incredible!, i thanks to mac for the way you gave him the helped and the loved that he deserved, FOR EVER STEVE JOBS IN MY LIFE AND MANY OTHER PERSONS.
It is with much sadness that I send my condolences and prayers to the family, friends and loved ones of Steve Jobs. Please know that he will be missed and that his thumb print on the world's technology will be forever engraved!
What will the world of technology be like without this great legend, how will it function??&nbsp; He built an empire this great only to leave it this soon.&nbsp; He will continue to live on within his creations. May god rest his soul in peace.  My deepest condolences to his wife and family. 
I just wanted to relay my heartfelt condolences to the Apple Family and Steve's family. I grew up, having been born in 1973, using Apple II's in school, lusted after my Algebra teachers PowerBook, managed to save enough money to buy a used Apple IIc in college and continued to marvel at the innovation that poured from Steve's mind in the ensuing years. At least in my life, Steve has had a most profound influence, even without ever having met him personally. His artful works, at Apple as well as Pixar, have brightened my life and my family's life. Even my son, of 9 years, knew full well the impact of losing Steve today. Steve has left an indelible mark on history. We will miss him greatly.
The world lost a visionary and and icon today. Steve will surely be missed. He changed the world for the better and we all lost someone extremley special today.  RIP Steve.
Thank you for making life so much fun with all of our sleek iGadgets!!!!  iHEAVEN awaits you!!!!!!  Rest in Paradise!!!  Sent from my iPhone 
I would like to thank Mr. Jobs for the fact that he has radically  changed my life and will do so. 
So shocked to hear that a legend has passed away. The man who built this great company with such dedication and spirit is no longer with us today but his work and great efforts will always stay. He will be missed.
May you rest in peace!      You've done an amazing job in your lifetime!  
In remembrance of the visionary that was Steve Jobs...may his genius and tenacity in both business and his person be remembered. My thoughts are with his family and friends. 
Even though I have never had the pleasure  of meeting Steve, it saddens me to think that a person who has contributed so much to the creation of products that has made the world a better place, products I enjoy and cherish and makes my life easier at work is gone.  Deepest sympathies to his family.
Sincere condolences - strangers like me feel like we knew Steve personally.  His dreams became part of our daily life.  May his memory be a blessing.&nbsp;
I can't live without iPhone and every time I use it I would be grateful   for your work. I will miss you and will tell my children what a legend you   have ever been.  Thank you, Steve Jobs.
           You Will Be Missed...        I can't express how much of a role model Steve Jobs has been for me. Steve Jobs was and is a very inspirational guy. I LOVE all of his inventions. Without Steve Jobs I would not be able to lounge on my iPad, FaceTime with my iPhone, or send this email on my iMac. Steve Jobs you will be missed greatly and my prayers and condolances are sent out. Steve Jobs will always be remembered.&nbsp;
What a loss to the world!  Rest in peace Steve Jobs.  Heaven has a brighter star tonight.  We will miss you immeasurably. God bless your family.
Not only did working for Apple change my life personally by leading me to my soulmate everyone I worked with, internally &amp; externally, shaped my life. He lead an amazing company and pushed people to follow their dreams and be better people.   His friends and family are in my thoughts. R.I.P. 
Very sad to hear that. The world has lost the spark to create innovative ways to do things better and easier!! Our condolences to the team amd family. Huge hugs from the middle of the world, Quito, Ecuador.. Hasta siempre Steve. .buen viaje!!&nbsp;
The first computer I ever worked on was the first little, tiny  macintosh...and I was hooked.  Today I make my living working online as  a web designer &amp; have graduated to the biggest, baddest Mac on the  market.  Steve Jobs' commitment to style, simplicity, and functionality  was an inspiration, and it will be a long time before anyone can fill  those shoes. 
I have believed in Apple Inc. and the brilliance of Steve Jobs from   the day i first landed on the shores of this country in 1991. He   embodied the spirit of America with: his courage, his optimism and his   perseverance. May his soul rest in piece, may his vision live on.&nbsp;
 ONE MORE THING,  Mr. Jobs, your contribution in technology will remain remarkable  forever.
My name is megan and I am in the 8th grade. I have dyslexia. My school has been providing Macs since they came to be. I have a macbook pro and it is a vision. &nbsp;This man single handedly changed my life. God bless this man. The genius of the century.  
You truly were a game changer. You took people with strong product  loyalty to your competitors, and made them a mac user. I'm converted  now, and I'm so sad it took me so long.  It's sad to lose a visionary just at the peak of everything. I'm sure  you already set Apple up for the next decade, because you were just that  innovative.  My condolences to your family, and to the rest of the world for losing  the great Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve jobs was the Thomas Eddison of our generation. A true visionary capable of driving innovation across a broad spectrum of industries, from computers to retail, Steve's abilities will be a huge loss to the world. His idea of how we should interact not only with our technology, but with society as a whole, was a brand in its own right and has changed how we all see and touch our world. Steve Jobs will be missed.&nbsp;
Steve's visions have changed the way we live, the way we will see the  world forever and I am eternally grateful. It was his speech at Stanford that inspired me and always inspires me  and reminds me to continue to do what I love and do all I can through my  company, to teach young people how it is do find out what you  love  and DO IT... As Steve said "Don't settle... have the courage to follow your heart  and intuition....your time is limited so don't waste it living someone  else's life.. Dont let the other voices drown out your own. Everything else is secondary.."
I am so saddened to hear of Steve's passing.  A true visionary, he will live on in our hearts and the technology that is so integral to our daily lives.  My thoughts and prayers are with his family. 
i can't really add anything of substantive value other than to say what most other people have already offered.  certainly a great loss.  perhaps one of the most memorable and lasting impressions of him that i will have, though, is his stanford commencement address.  that was truly inspired and i know i will come back to it often when i need some perspective and inspiration. for me, his words may just affect me more than anything else.  WWSJD 
Have fun up there in your iclouds! You have inspired and contributed a lot to the human race. All the best to all your loved ones.
Dear Steve,  America and the World will miss you immensely.  Thank You for making my world work so Well.  Your inventions, are Miracles.     See you in the Clouds, 
You changed the world. We'll miss you dearly. Thank you for inspiring so  many of us with your leadership and brilliant ideas. 
Sadly he has physically left our presence, but he motivated us all and will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the one I looked up to. He was my hero. He was a very  smart genius, but also a very important human being. Were all going to  miss Steve and always remember him in our hearts.
Honestly, I remember seeing the apple logo since I was three. My father and Mother owned an Apple-II in 1992. I never really got into Apple products until 200 when the first iPod was made. That was when I was immersed into the world of Apple and saw Steve's vision for what he wanted to achieve. I am a proud iMac owner and iPod user, and it's all thanks to Steve Jobs. May he be remembered in life always by his family, friends, and co-workers, and may he also be remembered as the man behind each product that touches the consumers.
Steve Jobs changed my life. Apple changed my life.
Can we imagine for a second that our Ipods and Macs never existed.. Its  hard to imagine isnt it? Each day I will look at my Mac and think of the  wonderful gifts that Steve Jobs has given to us.  RIP Steve Jobs, you will be missed dearly. 
 I honestly feel a little empty as I type this on my MacBook. He was a visionary and a great man. I'm truly sorry for his loss.            
R.I.P. He is always in my memory! 
I overheard someone mention his death in conversation and it was like hearing "Thomas Edison has died". Just about everything in my room that lights up has the Apple logo.
Thank You.  I started my software career, in high school on an Apple ][+, in 1980. I bought my first of dozen Macintoshes in 1984, and immediately coded on it. I actually worked for Apple's spin-off company Claris right out of college in 1988. I shipped a NeXTStep application in 1991, and was in NeXT's booth at a few Seybolds. I started developing iPhone apps in 2008.  I have a dogcow tattoo.  My family and I owe Steve and Apple a wonderfully fun, and exciting career developing for Apple products.  As Douglas Adams said "The Macintosh may only have 10% of the market, but it is clearly the top 10%."  RIP Mr. Jobs Nicely Done.  
I am deeply saddened by the news of Mr. Jobs passing. My prayers are with his family.
My thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family!    May God cushion your hearts!!
Steve was an example of a true visionary and leader.  In school we learned about Edison and Einstein, yet with Steve Jobs we lived through innovation.  It was an honor and inspiration to have this genius make and change technological history in our lifetime.
My deepest condolences to the Jobs family, he will always be in our hearts.
Hi The loss of such a human being is a big one for the world.  Steve, we hope that your trip is as awesome as the amazing creations that you left us with! We will forever be amazed with your kind of imagination and creativity, you were a gift for us all! Our son, had an assignment from school in which he was supposed to pretend to be a person he admires... he chose you! He made a big poster with a computer and put his face through it and started talking about all the amazing things you had created... I just told him you died (he is 9) and he sat down and sobbed...&nbsp;We will miss you.
One of my best Memories was when I got my first computer it was an old Apple PowerPC, one of the best machines Ive ever owned and Thank You very Much Steve for creating a whole new generation of technology and dreams. 
I was driving this evening on the way home listening to NPR when the broadcast was interrupted with the news of Steve's death. It came as a tremendous shock, I am still numb from the news.  I came to America in 1988.  Through the years I have been following Steve because of the inspiration and motivation he has provided in my personal life. I left Mechanical Engineering for the  computer world because of Steve.  I have now been in IT for 13 years.  He was the manifestation of courage in the Technology world. We have lost more than a leader, we have lost a true friend.&nbsp;
The technology world is at a standstill. Steve was the most innovative man ever  to exist. Sure it can be argued, but everyone has had the same opportunities. There were innovators and genuis' in every time frame of the world. Someone had to figure out how to stack the rocks at Stonehenge. Some one had to figure out how to build the great pyramids. And someone had to figure how to make our lives easier. Steve Jobs is in an elite group of humans. A man of his  stature doesn't come around too often. Once every hundred years I would guess. He has been a very important role in how we live today, I would have been  honored to know this man. After watching documentaries and reading what I can on him he had a love for what he did and that made him, "him".
Mr Jobs was a person that i looked up to. He was a great man. He was smart yet humble. He has inspired me to follow my dreams. He's the man! Thank you Mr Jobs for all you have given to this world. Now enjoy heaven. We miss you. Rest In Peace. 
Rest in peace Steve Jobs. I have known many who could not when they would, for they had not done it when they could...  
Thank you for sharing your Brilliant mind with us all! You truly changed  the world for the better!
This is my generation's Kennedy/John Lennon moment. It is a loss to the  world but the legacy is formidable and lasting; few get the chance to  make such a difference and have their difference make such impact.&nbsp;
I want express deep sorrow.       At one point I counted, 3, number of my family, 4, number of Iphone and Ipad, at my house.     This world today has lost great man.  Even though, I live far east very far away from silicon valley, life of Steve gave great influence to all the people in the world.        
 You have put more than a ding in the universe, you have left a everlasting mark!&nbsp;
So sorry to hear about Steve Jobs as he was an amazing visionary and I had the highest respect for him.  I only buy Apple products and he will not be forgotten.
More then most losses from the list of extraordinary Change Agents, the loss of Steve Jobs is a massive void.  An icon has passed, yet the impact of this man's work and life will be witnessed forever. A sober and sad day!&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your innovation and persistence over the years, you will go down in history as one of the modern world's true genius in design and marketing. I am truly saddened today to hear the inevitable news of his passing, may he rest in peace he certainly deserves it and my heart felt condolences to his family and friends.
as a big fan of apple,  as a big fan of steve,  i am buried in grief.   i will always remember him and what he have done for the world.    he will be living forever in everyone's mind.  rest in peace, steve.&nbsp;
Steve, you will never be forgotten. You have changed my life, and the  life of many others. You changed the way we think by thinking different  yourself. You have changed the universe and will never be forgotten.   -An Apple, and Steve Jobs fan. 
Someone on NPR rightly called Steve the Thomas Edison of our age.  They  also said, he was unparalleled as an innovator and without peers. I certainly agree.  And there was something about his spirit, - the  playful, excitement that showed up when he launched his 'babies.'   An  amazing man. He is a model for how to imagine outside of the box every day,.... in so  many lovely ways.  He will be missed, as our world does not see the  brilliance of a creator shine so  brightly so unmistakably. 
From a garage to the sky. Bye Steve, and thank you.
    And in the end...the love you take...is equal to the love...you make.            
Steve, you have inspired me to Think Different and be an individual with  a keen eye for success.  RIP to the one of a kind. 
Thank you for everything, Mr. Jobs, you will be always the fount of our inspiration for keep searching a better world with inovations that can change lifes.
I'm a Mac guy and a better marketer because Steve Jobs worked his craft so well. Thanks for the lessons, Steve. You will surely be missed. 
Thanks for everything Steve, you let us a better world! Good Bye dear Friend!
"Style is a simple way of saying complicated things"  Jean Cocteau. &nbsp;A true loss for this generation, Steve was that kind of man that was so conscious and aware of the world in which he lived that he could understand it and express it in simple and marvelous way. That kind of man it called a genius.  I send my thoughts and support to all the Jobs and Apple family. 
You have made me who I am. I was born with a learning disability.I have huge issues with legible writing. my grammar is almost non existence. That was until I got my first iBook in 2001. It changed my life. I was able to write and read it over. My ideas became concrete on the page. But as I, and Apple evolved I became more creative. Programs like GarageBand, Keynote, iMovie became20 my voice and my vision.  I have been able to thrive in several different fields. I went from shy and scared to outgoing and a voice for others. 46rom presenting ideas with keynote to taking it online with iWeb. My  integrated ilife has allowed me to succeed.  If it wasn't for Steve Jobs and Apple  I would not be who I am today. Apple has transformed society, whether it be me  sitting at a local civic committee meeting, to a government minister with an iPad. Thank you Steve Jobs.
We offer our sincere condolences to his family and all the people in Apple. We admire his life, his innovative ideas and we enjoy using Apple products.  We will keep his spirit in our hearts.
*THANKYOU STEVE :)*&nbsp;
 Steve, Rest in Peace. You've changed my life, you are a legend.
I feel as though I lost a friend today even though I never met him. Without a doubt, Steve, you are responsible for the direction my life took. I'm sorry I never had the chance to say "Thank You" in person.  thank you!&nbsp;
I have been on Mac for three years, but an avid follower for five. Apple has changed my life. Steve jobs is a source of huge inspiration to me, for his perseverance, and his charisma. He built Apple out of nothing, running from his parents garage. Every single time he went up on stage, or released news, he did it in only a way Steve Jobs could do so. He was a great man, a great businessman and a person whom I would have given anything to simply shake his hand and say thank you.   My thoughts are with Steves family, friends and colleagues  Goodbye Steve. Thank you.
I send my condolences to steve and his family and everybody who knew him. i feel like i lost a close buddie. he changed technology forever.  R.I.P Steve Jobs we love you 
His innovation in personal computer back the 1980s inspired me to embark onto a wonderful career in IT.  I can vividly remember when I started kindergarten in the fall of 1986, the Apple IIe was the first computer I ever saw in my life then.  Being a little boy with a strong curiosity like a cat really drove me to sneak over and press a key to see what happens next.  I even mistaken the monitor as a small ordinary TV.  Throughout my years in grade school, Apple Computers especially the Macintosh were my only favorite computers that I have depended on heavily on many occasions and I was heavily defending the Macworld side throughout the 1990s as a teenager.  Even when college required me to convert to PCs, I continue to remember and appreciate the legend that Apple Computers have done to inspire me to be one of many successful IT professionals to this day and I can only credit Steve Jobs for all the inspirations he had given me with his wonderful innovations in personal computers. 
Steve, was one of the greatest thinkers ever he will always be  remembered by everyone as an inspiration. RIP Steve Jobs  
Thank you for changing the world Steve, we will miss you.
I don't have any words, don't understand either why such a great man leaves this world so early. All my best to the future of Apple and strength for Tim Cook, I still love Apple like the first day. Thank you Steve, is all I can say right now.&nbsp;
To the Jobs Family and all of Apple,&nbsp;I am very sorry for your loss. The world&nbsp;is definitely a better place for all that&nbsp;Mr. Jobs&nbsp;brought to realization, not only for Apple but all of the industries that he was a part of and the other companies&nbsp;that he&nbsp;pushed/ challenged&nbsp;to be better than ordinary. 
And Steve Jobs' vision has enriched our lives in many more ways than we may ever know.
This is very sad news indeed. The world will deeply miss Steve. Even so, he will forever live in our hearts. Safe journey back. Wherever that is... R.I.P. 
You were one of the most creative people to ever live. You made machines  so beautiful and useful. God bless your family.
Thank you Steve Jobs for the Apple technology...Rest in Peace.
You never showed any fear or doubt about your dreams and through it all you brought to the world your thoughts and creations.  Leaving us leaves a vacuum that can never be filled, but Creator/God needed you more than we did.  Enjoy your new life's journey.
I'm 38 and I'm based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  I was 13 when I first worked with an Apple macintosh. I designed pages for a magazine and printed out sheets of text, which I placed on papergrids for the printer.  Now I work at a printshop and design websites. I still work on an Apple.  Steve, thank you for giving me these tools, so I can make a living for myself, my partner and my kids.
Dear Jobs.  I live in South Korea, I have visual impairment.  Your more creative products help me to overcome my disability.  In Korea, students with disability be supported own university. But  if they graduate from university, they are not help anything. I graduate from university. I can't small size's text and books and unfortunately  I don't have any solution to overcome.   Steve! I remember you say "The ipad is my best". i agree!  Your amazing Ipad chage my life obviously! I can read book, and text.  i don't need to some zooming devices or copying paper devices.   Now, so many visual impairment people use iphone or ipad. You give  them some light!   We can't meet you agin, We remember and love forever.  
Steve Jobs is the modern day Leonardo Da Vinci. He will be sorely missed by millions around the world.   Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs. You have touched us all immeasurably. Thank you for making the world a better place.
After years of the rise, fall, and the rebirth of Apple...Steve Jobs made the most undermentioned quote ever! "This is our Renaissance!" His revelation made during the opening of a post 2000 keynote will always be the most amazing thing he ever said. Besides his humanity that we all admire, he claimed a world wide win for a company called Apple. Cheers Steve!
Let today, October 5th for always be remembered as the Steve Jobs Day. I  praise the spirit of a man that changed the face of our generation. His  vision inspired us, motivated us, and enabled us to become the  generation we strive to become. Steve Jobs was a not only a pioneer, but a mentor to US: the youth of  today's world. To every son or daughter who yearned for a strong role  model we find it in him; a man that believed in us, a man who proved  nothing to be impossible. His legacy has forever changed the future of our wonderful world. He  leaves behind the platform for the unimaginable, the limitless, the true  inner creative potential of all human beings on this planet, and for  that and all else, we will forever be grateful to you.  Thank you, Steve!    
 I can't stop crying over the sad news. I have always admired Steve Jobs. The world has lost one of the greats, but his creation will live on forever!  God bless!!             
Steve,  Thanks for everything. You'll definitely be missed.   Apple For Life.
I would not be where I am and enjoy what I do if it had not been for  Steve Jobs.  His innovation and energy was a driving force to make Apple  what it is today.  Your genius was insurmountable and the world owes you  for your inventions and vision for the future.  There will never be  another Steve.  Thank You.
We have lost a very special person in the world!  May his spirit live on  for eternity.  He revolutionized the world and I am grateful for what he  has done! You will be missed Steve Jobs!
Steve Jobs was much more than a mere CEO of a company. He was an inventor, innovator and above all, a magnificent brain which has revolutionised this world with his creations. iPods, iPhones and iPads have changed the lifestyles of billions.  Only a few among us can do that and Steve with his very simple personality did that. With his death, not only Apple has lost its Chairman, the world has lost a magnificent, creative mind. I'm heart-broken... RIP Steve!&nbsp;
... mas no la inspiracion que nos ha legado.&nbsp;
 To Steve's family, friends and colleagues, and all those who loved him,  please accept my deepest sympathies.  It's a sad sad day for the Apple  family today.    
The industry has lost a tech god and mankind, a great soul. May God bless his soul and my prayers and thoughts are with his family. May his untimely passing sow the seeds of more Steve Jobs.    " A tiger dies and leaves its stripes, a man dies and leaves his name"&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the best. He owned the best company in the world. I feel  sad for him and his family. 
A Great Loss To Earth but a great gain to heaven.&nbsp;
I am in shock.  What a great mind and visionary he was.  He will forever be in my thoughts.&nbsp;
How sad.   The world has lost a genius, who forever changed the way we  do things.  Lost but never forgotten.....&nbsp;
You are the Thomas Edison, the Leonardo Da Vinci and the Aristotle of  our time. Since I have been alive I've used apple products. It's for me  to even rap my mind around these events that just transpired. Rest in  peace Steve Jobs the legacy you have left is unbelievable, and in my  mind you will never be dead. My prayers go out to your family, and  everyone battling the awful disease of cancer. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.
Though I was not fortunate enough to know Steve, I was lucky enough to own his products. Though I am both technologically ignorant and not business-saavy, I recognized early on that Steve Jobs was the creative force and inspiring visionary behind the most elegant and user-friendly computers on earth. I became an Apple investor in 1997 and my very small investment grew to become the foundation of my retirement account. I thank Mr. Jobs and Apple for helping me that way! But most of all, tonight, on hearing this sad news, I offer my sincerest condolences to Steve's family and friends, and that includes the legions of loyal Apple employees. God Bless You Steve Jobs and God Speed. 
I do not believe that is true. S.J is my idol with every aspects from life to work. I just think he leave apple to take a rest, and I am sure he need a rest. But,morning I am so crazy with the news S.J is go forever and I do not  have a chance to see him (not on the stage, just like an audience like ever yone who comes to see new apple presentations).Hope S.J rest in peace. You are always in my mind. The truly icon of new modern Americans.   Thank you so much. My english is not good. Hope reader understand and share my view.
For a man I never met, he sure has moved my life.
So young, so sad.  Thank you Steve Jobs for your genius in giving APPLE  to us -  a brilliant legacy, one which we enjoy every day.  Vale.
Steve Jobs was a great person and it's a huge loss for all of us... He changed the concept of technology and with charisma won the affection  of many users of Apple products and others that know him by best C.E.O EVER! R.I.P Steve Jobs We're going to miss you! 
My condolences,  he was a great contribution to apple, 21st century  technology and our society. We will remember you. 
Steve Jobs transformed the lives of so many, and indeed made the  social revolutions which are transforming the Middle East possible.  Without the iPhone Facebook would not exist.  He transformed how we  get music with the iPod. He has made the modern world, and it is too  tragic that he cannot live another 30 years to continue the work of  his creative genius and enjoy its achievements.  My thoughts are with his family. I feel a personal sense of loss.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has taught us one important lesson, the vision comes from the heart, from the heavens. Many battles fought just one important battle lost…..  I have thought about this many many times in the last months, I knew the end is unavoidable. Rest soft, rest in peace and most of all a heartfelt thanks for your vision, your passion and most of all for YOU.
just wanted to say so sorry for the loss of Steven! He really shaped our world we live in today.&nbsp; My deepest sympathies go out to his family.
Steve has been such a large part of our lives for many years now and he  will be sorely missed.  The world has just lost a true visionary.
Sincere, meaningful and forever cool. 
The world has lost a visionary. Technology will never be the same without him, my condolences to his family. He will be sorely missed by the entire world.  
Steve Jobs was a visionary who changed the shape of the world. The technologies that he has pioneered have not only led to new forms of media and entertainment -- they've also found use saving lives and spreading freedom. His loss is a loss to the world, and we will all miss him dearly. My thoughts also go to the members of his family and his friends, who have seen him taken away far too young. I hope that in time they will be able to take strength from his memory and follow in his path. 
Sadly missed, thanks for the hope and aspiration.
I can still remember my first Mac in 1989 at Sprint, and I knew Macintosh was going to define technology. Steve Jobs you did that. We will remember you for years to come. You were a Genius. In the book of technology you are at the top.
If history misses men like Isaac Newton, Graham Bell, Galileu, Thomas Edison and Einstein, I'm certain that it'll remember and miss Steve Jobs Forever. "Stay Hungry. Stay foolish" Goodbye, Dear Steve. I'll miss you.&nbsp;
   Steve Jobs was the quintessential example, living proof of the concept that "Inspiration is the Essence of Execution"     His inspirations resulted in great concepts which Apple manufactured or executed into fantastic products.     Competitors who look at the finished Apple product  and try and imitate will always fall short - because they simply never shared in the thought processes or inspirations that went into the products execution.     If he had been an Australian - he'd have been a Queenslander for sure - huge heart, indomitable, courageous, fearless to the end - a true winner.     I dip my head in deference to the man - my condolences to his family.&nbsp;
A truly genius mind was silenced today, his innovations will live on   to inspire generations of thinkers well beyond our current time. Steve   will be missed for what he has contributed to our generation, but he   will surely never be forgotten. R.I.P 
Just gonna miss him.&nbsp;
I understand the loss of seeing someone you love and admire lose their strength, both mentally and physically. My heart goes out to Steve's family, both personal and company.  My Father passed away on June 17, 2011 from Cancer. When I last spoke with my Father, took images, video and audio of him, it was with an iPhone 3GS. We were estranged for so long and the Flip camera I used last year to get video of him stopped working as soon as I got home. I still haven't seen that footage but Apple made it possible for me to see him today and every day.  People talk about how he made gadgets sleek and beautiful. For me, it was the integration which changed my life. His innovation empowered users.  Thank you.
Rip Steve thank you for all the innovations&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for everything you did! You will always be remembered.  Alex
Condolences to Job's familiy and colleagues.  You made my life so much easier.&nbsp;
Truly a remarkable human being. A sad loss at such a young age.
Hello:           Maybe you don't know me, but Mr Jobs really is the world made a contribution. He has changed our lives, changing our world, only this and offer our profound condolences, open a webpage, heard the news like a bolt from the blue. Have a safe trip home.
There are very few people in the world that nearly all of us would agree that our lives are better because that person lived at the same time as we have.  Steve Jobs is in fact the only one I can think of.  I am very thankful to have been able to be along for the ride.  Rest well, Steve.  My condolences to his family, and to all of those affiliated with Apple who are feeling this loss.
 Thank you, Steve.  Thank you for everything you have done in the computer, music, and tablet industries.  Thank you for being a great person who was very determined in your work and who was a great role model for many people.   I know how hard this is to go through because my dad had some of the same i llnesses that you had and at one point looked exactly like you.  I pray for you and your family, and hope that you know you were loved and now missed.  Rest in peace Steve, I know you are in a better place now.&nbsp;
We are merely users and big fans of anything Apple. His memory will live on.  With heart and prayers.
Steve Jobs' entire life and legacy is so inspirational to me, as I'm sure it is to millions. His story is incredible and it makes me want to be better at my own endeavors. He was amazing. The world has lost someone truly irreplaceable, but more importantly, his family has. My most positive thoughts and condolences are with the Jobs' family. 
RIP Steve Jobs. You were an inspiration to all of us. Apple would not have gone this far without you. I remember getting my first IPod Nano and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Then I got the I touch and next year when my contract ends I'm getting the I Phone. Let's just say I have become an apple addict. Let us have your legacy carry on. I wish I could have known you as a person not the guy that made my IPod&nbsp;better but I will always remember you for the help you gave into the world.
There have been in history few people , that truly changed the world,  in a more creative , intelligent, positive and peaceful manner. May  our continued support, of his genius continue to change the world for the positive. Thanks Steve,   You will be missed by so many.
Thank you Steve for all the memorable moments you have given me!  Will never forget you!  RIP
Steve,  Thank you for the inspiration you have been to all of us. To never settle for what we know, and to challenge ourselves with new ideas. I am an IT professional, and you single handedly changed my entire life. If it was not for you, and a few other visionaries, I would not be in the profession I am today. Thank you for everything you did, and never settling for anything but the best. I still to this day do not use your Macintosh computers, but must admit that they are the most polished and innovative computers in the world. Today I am typing on this wonderful device called an iPad 2, and I use every product you make outside of Macintosh computers. That was your vision though wasn't it? To build a mobile world, and change conventional computing as we know it. Thank you Steve Jobs; you will truly be missed by us all!&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs you have left the world a better place with your many  contributions, and the world is indebted to you Sir.  Thank you for having the courage to follow your vision and the strength  to change the world not once, but many times.  May you enjoy the afterlife you so richly deserve.  My thoughts and prayers are with the Jobs family, friends and Apple. &nbsp;
Your name will forever be associated with this decade, whenever people  look back at what shaped this millennia. You will always be loved by the millions who hold their Apple products  everyday as extensions to their selves and personalities, and through  which you'll live on.  Thank you Steve. You will be remembered.&nbsp;
When Mr. Jobs stepped down from the CEO position at Apple a short time   ago, I happily read in the many articles about his life and legacy   that his was not a path of a virtuoso academic, but the path of an   artist. I saw in his life a light to guide my own, as I am in a   similar place to where he once was. I am freshly 26 years old and have   spent time traveling and learning and have not yet found my place, but   have known that my place is not in the Ivy League or the cubicle. I   hear Steve's words: Follow Your Heart. Find What You Want to Do. You   Are Already Naked, Don't Be Afraid. I am truly moved by these thoughts   and by Steve's manifestation of these words. They were not just   distant philosophy, they were practicable and accomplishable. I am not   afraid to seek out and build my own destiny. I am more strongly   focused and more sure of my path and my future triumph. And I thank   Steve Jobs for this. 
Well. Its very sad to know that the person that was a co creator of all these new technology has just passed. I thank him for his creative and genius ideas. Thank you Steve Jobs
Steve Jobs has always been the man I looked up to all my life, he is the  one man that i admired the most, he is the one man i want to be when I  grow up. And when I heard of his death today I was left breathless. But  what he has done for the world will always remain with us, he has truly  revolutionized the world. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
This is devastating. I can't wrap my head around the news. A true genius has been lost. A man that literally changed the world. I'm sure Apple will continue to be a great company but the world will never be the same...very sad.  My best to all of Steve's family, friends and Apple and my sincerest condolences.&nbsp;
 Dear Apple crew, I'd just like to humbly say and let you know that I'm deeply moved to express my most sincere acknowledgement of such a creative and brilliant capacity to understand human life both in the late twentieth and the twenty-first centuries. Steve's 15-minute speech at Stanford University in 2005 is just a token of [someone having] an amazingly thorough, crystal-clear and profound insight into the vicissitudes of human life.  A huge "Thank-you", Steve, for showing us how to "think different" and "connect the dots by looking backward, not forward". Steve's iconic image will definitively glow and linger "to the Infinity and beyond..." We'll miss you unmeasurably, Steve.
What an incredible visionary. Only Steve Jobs could make me  wait for   the latest and greatest product. I'm not one to wait, but I knew the   wait would be more than worth it. I pray God will comfort his family in their time of deep sorrow.
 It's very sad news to hear that Steve Jobs has passed away, he was really a great man, a real visionaire and I'm sure a caring husband and father. He has made what Apple is today and definitely left his fingerprint on all Apple products and company. I personally present to his small family my sinceres condolences and encourage his former colleagues to continue working with his spirit and vision.&nbsp;
Thank you for all the innovation and inspiration. 
  Our dearest Steve,         Yes, it plays music, keeps me in touch with loved ones, and helps me manage life. Sure, I love my iPhone and my iPad. But, what I love the most is that you have been such an innovator in our society. You have managed to create and lead a team that produce products that change so much of the way we live, work and play. You are an icon and we thank you for all of your "insanely great" contributions, seen and unseen. Our condolences to the Jobs family as well as the Apple family.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve, for changing the world. Your vision and creativity have inspired the world. With your help, youth of today have the potential to change the world. You were, indeed, one of the "Crazy Ones." You will be missed by so many. May God bless you in your passing and journey, and may God care for your family. You will be remembered and missed.&nbsp;
I am 49 years old and remember when home computers were little more   than glorified word processors. I have been on this amazing journey   brought to us by Steve Jobs. Steve changed all of our lives. Why?   Because he wanted everyone to benefit from Apple's greatness. He   marginalized no one. He didn't want to reach only a younger   demographic, or an older one. His vision was for ALL of us.  I know Apple will continue to make great products but I sure would   have liked to spend the next few decades enjoying the fruits of his   great vision. So sorry he's gone so soon.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was definitely one-of-a-kind man. I am very grateful for have been born in this time of scientific and technical advances, but the world would be very different if we had had only one choice to access information technology, without the elegance, innovation and customer-oriented approach of Apple. The brilliant ideas of Steve will be always in our minds. God bless Steve Jobs.
It means "thank you" in Italian.  Thank you Steve for your vision and your determination in making dreams come through.  Thank you for having brought products to make our life easier, better and more exciting.  Thank you for your obstinacy in creating and leading a unique company from a magic vision.  Thank you for having proved that dreams can come true.  Thank you for your "simple is better" style.  Rest in peace and, again, grazie.&nbsp;
I've just heard this news just less then an hour ago and I feel empty Steve was my role model. He's revolutionized this world's technology I doubt we will see a man as great as him. I heard the news and I doubted it I felt like I was in a nightmare and still am. I'm sad and wherever Steve is I hope he is well I had a vision to work with him but my vision is to meet his expectations I'm still young and even though he has passed away I feel he's motivating me still 
At the first years of med school I heard Steve's connecting the dots speech,  it had a great impact on my career and life. I'm deeply sorry about the loss that the world had today
    Steve vai com Deus !            
a fantastic human being,  leaving us all the wonderful gift of   vision....  thank you steve jobs. 
Steve was the pioneer of all time in the history of creative gadgets,  with an iPhone in hands, I still feel the passion of him. Long live the KING of iWorld.&nbsp;
 I began my art education as a graphic design major -  We had the coolest looking mac computers, the big blue ones, which no one outside of the Art world would dare use!  I was an outcast using a Mac, a real odd ball.  PC users were on the rise, and only the really far out art people used APPLE. But the art world loved their APPLE computers, and despite all the ridicule, being on the verge of bankruptcy , and the inability to communicate at times with anyone outside of the APPLE world, we stuck it out!  And look at us now.  We are now and always will be the true Apple nuts!  Thanks Steve, for all the forward thinking, the passion and your artistic vision. You are Apple.  And we thank you for that!&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You are a legend.  Looking at the world you have transformed I believe you will have no regrets.  Thanks for your inspiration and your persistence. You didn't only leave us new electronics, you leave us a spirit.&nbsp;
Rest In Peace, Steve!  You have been my number 1 idol since I first got my iPod back in 2007. Since then I've been looking onto you! I've got every single product you've invented.   I hope one day I will be as successful as you!  Thanks for changing me to become an ambitiousness person! I'll miss you!
My condolences to Steve Jobs' family, friends, and all those who knew and had the pleasure to work with him. As I write this from my iPhone surrounded by an apartment filled with Apple devices I can't help but recognize just a few of his many achievements. It is  a shame that he will not be able to see the future that is, in no small part, possible because of him.
Today, we bid farewell to a man who undertook the challenge of showing the world that technology and art can be one. His innovative mentality pioneered technology into its most beautiful form. His legacy will stand through his memory, and through his creations. We must thank Steve for his work and his everlasting dedication. We must thank him for inviting us to think outside the norm and question our limits. More than an innovator and a genius, Steve is an example.  May he rest in peace. 
Such a loss always will be remembered. R.I.P Steve Jobs&nbsp;  
In 2008, after nearly 20 years of working with computers, I was burnt out. It wasn't fun anymore. My brand-new, $3,000 laptop didn't do half of what it was supposed to do right out of the box.   Then someone said, "You really should have a look at the Macbook Pro..."  I did, and I never looked back.  Thank you, Steve, for making computing fun again. I will miss watching your presentations. I will miss hearing about "one more thing". 
Your legacy will live on and shape things to come.    You will be missed.    -Loyal apple customer.  
I am emotionally distraught to hear that one of my heroes has died  today. May he rest in peace and live on for generations to come to be  inspired.
Since my first Macbook I always had an apple product next to me. I never realize how much your vision impact my life. My prayers and thoughts are with your family. You will be missed and remember. Thank you Steve.
America has just lost the most important man in the world VERY VERY sad. I never got to meet you Steve. You are my inspiration.&nbsp;
I give God thanks for such a gifted man and the gifts he shared with the  world.  God bless you, Steve!&nbsp;
I never met Steve. At first glance it would seem that my life has  nothing to do with him. And yet, every time I make a phone call, listen  to a song, type up a report, or watch a video on youtube, a little piece  of him is there. I always eagerly watched his enthusiastic keynote  presentations, and anxiously awaited every product arrival. even though  I never met him, his legacy remains in my life forever. Thank you, Steve  Jobs. 
"The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking...and don't settle." - Steve Jobs  Steve, you had me at your Standford University address, my eMac, iMac, iPod(s) and iPhone. You are a legend.&nbsp;
I do say that steve was an inspiring person to even those who did not know him.  "Life is better lived when it is full of love and joy"&nbsp;
We lost a good one. No, we lost one of the best - but his legacy will live on for a long time.
Mr. Jobs was a visionary. I always was eager to see the latest gadgets he wa s going to introduce. You could see the excitement in his face which always made me run out and buy the newest innovation.To his friends and family you have my sympathy and prayer. Mr. Jobs well done now you can rest easy.
Thank you Steve for being one of the true geniuses the world has ever seen. You will be sorely missed. an amazing man has been lost. Thank you Steve!&nbsp;
I thank you Mr. Steve Jobbs, for your brilliant mind that brought to   so many of us the enjoyment of so many APPLE products. I know that I   would be lost with out having my imac to me no other computer could   ever come close.  To me my MAC is so much fun to use and I feel very   safe using it. You gave us so much not only in computers but phones, ipods, Pixar and   so much other entertainment etc.,  I know that your Legacy shall live   on forever.  I know that it will take one hell of a fantastic person   such as yourself to try and walk in your shoes.    May your soul rest in Eternal Peace. Amen!  My thoughts and prayers are with the family of Steve Jobbs.  With thoughts of Sympathy,     When you    Lose someone so very precious, No one else can really know all that you feel. But, please know that many caring thoughts are with you during this time of sorrow. Please may it comfort all Family Members to know that your dear loved one is now resting in the arms of God.
The whole world has lost a great leader. A unique person, a true genius  who was on a par with men like Einstein and Da Vinci! He will never be  replaced by anyone... But we know that wherever he goes, he will truly  make that place a better place as he did in our world! The world is  better today because of him. 
Steve, You set the bar very high and we all better for it. Thanks for  being a great inspiration and visionary.
 Desejo os meus sentimentos a Família de Jobs como também aos funcionários da Apple nesta data triste ...A tecnologia está de LUTO assim como os seguidores como eu.&nbsp;
I am so sorry to hear of Steve's passing. Words cannot describe the magnitude of his vision. He change my life. He changed the world. I will miss him dearly.  Thank you, Steve.
Steve taught us all to "think differently." His 2005 commencement address to Stanford is something I keep in my desk drawer when I forget why I do what I do. Not having attended Stanford, I read the speech in the newspaper then. I have kept it in my desk drawer ever since. That speech reminds me to "stay hungry and foolish," to listen to my own intuition and let it guide me to where I need to be.  He was the original crazy one, misfit and trouble maker. He was a true genius.  I extend my condolences to his wife Laurene, his children and his entire family. Thank you for sharing him with all of us.&nbsp;
I recently started working for Apple.  I have a wonderful place to go to  work each day.  I am surrounded by warm, kind, and intelligent people.   Thank you Steve for creating that environment for me.  My deepest  sympathies to your family.  I recently lost my father at fifty-six.   There are simply no words. 
My sincere condolences to the family, friends and collegues of Steve Jobs. My Name is Monica T Santos. I live in Brazil, and started my career in  System Analysis using the first computer Steve and Apple built, back in  the 80's. Since then, Apple and specially Jobs have conquered, not only  a customer, but a faithful fan. Steve Jobs was Unique. A man ahead of his time, An example of  creativity, geniality and open mind to the new and the unusual. An  example and an inspiration. May he rest in peace, from his last battle. May he never be forgotten!  He will never be forgotten!!&nbsp;
There is nothing I can say to ease his family and friend's sorrow, we all have lost a piece of ourselves today. God bless you all. Heaven just got upgraded.&nbsp;
At times like this there are no words for alleviating pain and longing, but our hearts are warmed to know that Steve was a good man, an inventor and a great leader odd. May God comfort the hearts of family, friends and all who have always had an appreciation and fondness for him.  I learned to program on an Apple II in my first computer course for almost 25 years ago, this little box has made all the difference in my life.  Rest in peace Steve and thanks for everything.&nbsp;
 I was going to email this to you a while ago but never did. When my baby girl was born last year we almost lost her. She stopped breathing after birth and didn't start again on her own until 12 hours later. It was a horrific situation. The doctors prepared us for a pretty grim outlook. While she was in the NICU I used my iPhone to document every event which was immediately uploaded to Facebook where all my family and friends from around the world watched and prayed. I never would have been able to do that without your vision for the iPhone.   Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
You really changed the world... Now, we need to discover how to do it without you...  Thanks for all.
I am sad to hear that Steve has passed. The world has lost a father of  design and ingenuity. There will be one more bright star in the sky  overhead tonight.
It's sad to see such a brilliant mind go. No doubt will he forever be remembered, my condolences to you all. May he rest in peace.  -
Steve was someone who inspired me. I love Apple and all of their products. I  will miss the vision that he brings to Apple.
Steve is the great man and I will remember him forever. 
Steve Jobs greatness has only begun to be appreciated. For decades to  come people will come to realize how Steve changed the entertainment  world for all to enjoy and appreciate so easily. From the Mac to the  iPod, from iTunes to iCloud, Steve ability to bring together great minds  and great ideas and wrap them up into magical devices has made him a  World Icon. He changed the way the entire music industry operates,  saving it single handedly from the Napsters of the world, by making it  easy to not only purchase music individually or buy album, but also by  making it easy to put on on mobile device so that music can be with you  wherever you go. The Mac, the Mouse, iPod, iTunes, iPhone, iPad,  iCloud. Steve made it all easier. Many years from now, it will be  easy to reflect back and realize how special Steve Jobs was and how  lucky the World was to have his brilliance..Thank you Steve Jobs, for  changing my life forever. 
Dear Apple family  We would like to extend to you our deepest condolences for the lost of   one, who, as we here always try to push the boundaries.   One without who there wouldn't be a working model in the digital economy   for us, the independent music executives out of all corners of the world.  We are so very proud to be given a opportunity to work with Apple iTunes   directly and so consider ourselves part of your family. On that note, as   Brazilians, we do believe in reincarnation and by doing so know that Steve   is at a much better place as well as that he is here; Right there at his   office, looking at some figures and planning new designs as they come to   him.  God bless him and all at Apple.
Steve  Thank you for everything.  Without you I would not know the joy of a Pixar film.  My children would not know the joy and the wonder of watching every film Pixar ever made.  Without you, my children would not have their Ipod Nano's to help entertain them during long car trips and help them focus while they do their homework and their reading.  Thank you for my 1st computer, an Apple II.  I had so much fun as a child playing on it.  My cellphone contract is up and I am getting my 1st iphone next month.  I have been waiting for that day for 2 years.  Thank you for being an innovator. Thank you for being a dreamer.  Thank you for always making your dreams into reality.  You will be missed but I will think of you every day when I use my ipod to listen to my favorite songs, when I go to itunes and download my favorite podcasts and songs I havent heard in years. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.
The world lost it's light today. But he will forever be remembered though his legacy. Now he met Newton, Einstein and other geniuses like him.  My tears flow because I'm selfish: I'm sad you left us. But I know you are better now and your spirit will be in every Apple product we have: now we have a billion pieces of Steve Jobs. Rest well.&nbsp;
We will not forget you, the way you changed the world is different from all others. &nbsp;Thank you for your efforts for us.&nbsp;
I’ll thank the extraordinary Mr. Jobs for two main reasons. First, and most important, the iPod, the greatest and most important technological invention since the cellphone. Second, but not less important, that amazing speech he gave at Standford University in the year 2005. He’ll be able to speak to human souls in need forever with those eternal wise words, just like he spoke to mine. You’ll be missed. 
I sit in front of a Mac every day since 1988. Had my first Macbook in 93. Gray plastic. My first printer was a LaserWriter II. I use a PowerBook today. I was one of the few who had a Newton. Today I have an iPhone 4, an iPad2 and a Silver Mac. My work and my life had been powered by Apple. Apple design has always been great and Steve presentation and speeches always inspiring. I think we designers will be very sad without Steve.  Thank you for giving us all that wonderful ideas, tools and inspiration.  Good bye Steve.
When I met a Mac, then I decided to go to a graduate school in US. When I met an iPhone, then I decided to start up a company.  All my life is inspired by Steve, and it will be from now on.  I believe Apple team keeps taking over his spirit, and making with products that Steve loves.   Many many thanks to Steve from Japan.
Mankind has suffered a great lost...
Steve Jobs sculpted the standard for modern technology and he will not   be forgotten. Through this, he will always live.
Ever since I was young, my family didn't even know what Apple really  was. They just considered it to be a regular computer company. Apple is  more than that, and I showed them exactly that. When I was 11 years old,  I convinced my Mom to buy a MacBook Pro for herself. I spent 2 years  trying to convince her. Now I am 14, and my entire family together owns  5 iPod Touches, 2 iPhones, 1 iPad, and 2 macs. Steve Jobs was such a hero for me, it was because of him that I want to  be a computer designer when I grow up.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs got me my first Apple computer the the 128K Mac in February 1983.  Signed inside the box by the original designers, it had the first single floppy Sony drive, an integrated monitor screen, that became the hallmark of the Mac, and greeted you with a smiley face each time you turned it on. 28 years later, I still own that 128k Mac and every Apple product that came thereafter from the Newton to the Cube to the iPhone 4S. God Bless You, Steve Jobs. The world will never be the same.&nbsp;
To Steve's family, thank you for sharing this amazing human being with  the world. We will forever miss him! Condolences to you and your family.&nbsp;
I've just been very much surprised to know this sad news and I've been very much happy to have touched something created by Steve and his companies.  Please allow me to deliver my sincere condolences to him, his family and all members at Apple Corporation.
Since I was a young tot, my family has always loved Apple and what it stood for.  I remember the days when I would argue with my friends about how Apple computers were superior to PC's.  Oh how things have changed!  What an awesome, innovative soul Steve was/is.     Thank you Steve, for everything you stood for and brought to our lives. 
You are my inspiration an I am sure you are inspired many others too.  You will be in my memory forever. Rest In Peace&nbsp;
One of the best inventors and visionary I will ever see in my life. Rest in peace Mr.Jobs.
Steve Jobs, it has been an honor and pleasure having you with us for all these years. You've been a great human being to all of us and an inspiration to all for developing more innovative design, many of us look up to you and right now we hope you rest in peace. We hope you guide us all to discover more innovative design, discoveries and keeping your legacy alive. Thank You!
I'm trully sorry about Steve Jobs. He changed the world we live in! He's someone who will always be remembered as one of the greatest minds! Thank you for everything! Apple please keep up with the good work, honoring this great leader!&nbsp;
Whenever I thought about the challenges that faced me or the failures  that pop up in my life, one of the favorite stories I'd always go back  to is the one of Steve Jobs. His sheer genius is one that is truly  inspiring and how he returned to Apple to make it what it is today is  something I tell all of my students whenever they execute their business  plans. My friends and I are deeply saddened by this loss. The world has lost  one of the greatest visionaries of the century. Rest in peace Steve  Jobs. You will be missed by people across the globe. 
To Steve,  Thank you for sharing your vision with the world.  We will miss you dearly.
 You have changed our world.  How we work, play and communicate.  Our world will never be the same because of your innovation and passion.   Now I know how MJ fans felt when their superstar passed away.   Thank you!  You are our rock star!              
Beloved Steve Jobs, It's sad to heard that u had left us. It's so sudden. Thanks for creating Apple to this world. U are indeed a genius! May u rest in peace!
It is with great sadness that I read about the passing of Steve Jobs. I have been a long time aficionado of all things Apple. Being someone who is a self-professed techie, I had such great admiration for his vision and creativity. I know Apple, the company, will survive and prosper, because I know he would have it no other way. He had such a personality and through his excitement for a new technology, he got the rest of us excited. His enthusiasm was contagious! The world is indeed a very different and better place because of Steve Jobs.
Thank you for paving the way for generations to come, to dream like you did!   May you rest in peace. Thank you for inspiring!  Prayers and thoughts to the family and friends.
I have followed Mr. Job’s life and impact on human intellectual development.you will be truly missed Steve.May you rest in perfect peace
Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. Thank you for educating us, inspiring us, and enriching our lives. Our world will never be the same. Thank you for making it so exciting and approachable for all of us. You have made technology more understandable for so many people. You will be missed.
Steve Jobs was a big inspiration to me.  I didn't like myself in presentations, somehow not knowing what to do with  my hands. I was browsing one day and stumbled upon one of Steve's videos -  watching him present was amazing and awe-inspiring. Ever since that day I've  always looked at the same video before I go for a presentation or a  meeting I needed to chair and  tried to channel his poise, mimicking his  composure,   I've got so much confidence instilled in me because of him.  My prayers go out to his family and friends, Tim Cook, and his dedicated  and talented employees.  Lilian, from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 
R.I.P. Steve Jobs "We don¹t get a chance to do that many things, and everyone should be really excellent. Because this is our life, life is brief, and then you die, you know?" ­ (Steve Jobs). Steve dies, this makes me amazingly sad, even some tears appear in my eyes, but Apple, never forget, it was his lifework and should be forever his lifework. All of you  workers, managers, designers, really all of you who are responsible for the amazing products, made him a rich man. Not from the financial point of view but from the social one. You all made him proud. You have been a family. And you will be forever. Never forget his illusion and always work hard, to continue his lifework.  A little of us lost a father, a husband Some of us lost a friend Many of us lost a director But the most of us lost an idol, me too.  We will never forget him Sincere condolences! All the best to all of you, keep your head up!     
We'll miss you.&nbsp;
iThank you for everything you've done Steve. Bringing the right taste to technology.
Just wanted to say my son never met Steve but you would swear they were best friends!!  Charles is a 3rd year student at UVA and during his freshman year in high school, he fell in love with Steve's passion.  We, as a family, would talk about Apple and Steve around the dinner table.  Steve was my son's hero because he proved as long as you really loved what you do and had the desire for all to win......Success was inevitable.   Steve's passion was contagious and therefore, he will live on in the hearts of all of us.  What an inspiration for a kid now in college!  Hopefully, my son will follow in Steve's "heartsteps".  With much love and joy!
Hello Apple my name is Conner I am 11 years old anf I have loved Steve Jobs for a very long time and my thoughts go out to this wonderful peice of art   Steve Jobs Was My Hero
Just yesterday I wrote my first blog, aptly named "My obsession with  Steve Jobs". Had I known we would lose him forever, I would have kept  going. I am humbled by Steve Jobs. I never met him, nor will I ever, but  he will hold a place in my heart. He changed our lives, he changed our  World, and most importantly, he changed my kids' World. Thank you Steve,  for making our lives so fun. You will forever inspire me to be greater.  Thank you for making me want to be not only a better person, but also a  greater person. May God rest your soul.
 This is my way of saying thank you for inspiring our generation to think differently and change the world through use of computers and its technology. Steve, may you continue to guide us.              
Dear Friends,      Steve Jobs will always inspire our imagination of how to surprise people  wishes they didn't even know they had. He's spirit will always be "spiration" for us!
Farewell Steve Jobs,thanks for your brilliant innovations that you brought to the world....we'll remember you always....&nbsp;
I am very saddened by the world's loss of Steve Jobs. He was one of my Heroes and is someone I had always looked up to. A lot of the stuff Steve and the Apple team have done has changed the world in a good way and I deeply appreciate all the things you and Steve have done. He is definitely someone I would have loved to meet and thanks at some point in time, since he is someone who has indirectly taught me a lot about technology and innovation. I will truly miss him, not as just an innovator, but as a person and professional. I will never forget the things he and his team have brought to the world and will always remember him as a true individual.
You are a genius! Thank you for all you have given...you have changed  the world, and inspired others...you've made this world a better place. 
Mr Jobs, You will be dearly missed.  Although I have never met you, without you our company would probably not exist.  Our prayers are with your family and friends at this time.  Thank you for your vision and great technologies.&nbsp;
No one will ever forget Steve Jobs. He was one of the most important and well known person in the world, and has done so many&nbsp;influential things. Steve is a big part of my life and always will be.&nbsp;
One of the top creative minds of the modern age, will be greatly missed. 
We thank God for blessing us with one who has made life simple and yet enjoyable through his ideas.  We will miss him.&nbsp;
Dear Apple and Steve Jobs' family, I am so sorry for your loss. Steve was a great person. he made  the music industry what they are today. Nothing would be what it is  today without Steve. R.I.P to Steve.
I was shocked and jolted when I heard the terrible news of Steve Jobs being no more. A hard worker who followed his passion, a visionary my idol. I am deeply saddened by the loss. He is possibly the only person I look upon from this era. His little talk at Stanford is probably one of the best motivational speeches I have ever heard. I've ever since tried to inculcate his advises from that particular speech. I have no words to express the sense of void that I feel in my heart. May his soul rest in peace. Like someone said, All great people die young. Yes, he was great!!! My deepest condolences to his family for their loss.
My thoughts and prayers go out to the family, friends, influences, and  influenced of Steve Jobs.  Words cannot describe what a true loss this  has been.  Steve is not only a creative genius but the one who really  defined the 21st century and took computing to places no one has seen.   Let Steve's legacy be forever lived! 
He made the world a better place with his passions and super natural innovations. He is the legend.&nbsp;
While I never was fortunate to know the man other than his name, my deepest condolences to all of those that knew and loved the man that contributed so much to the world. We will miss you Steve, you will live on through those that loved you the most.   
May God bless your soul Steve...We will miss you forever..you really did transform the music and computer industry.
Left the world for a better place. Thanks for the memories.
I have been an apple user since I was born. The first computer we had in  our home was an apple and I used to spend hours on it. As I grew up I  continued to use apple products and watched as they changed the world.  Steve Jobs was a truly inspirational man who changed so many lives  throughout the world with his innovation and determination. Thank you for everything you did for me, and the world
I'm no one special just one of many creative students at the Ringling College of Art and Design in Sarasota FL where we all use Apple products 24/7. Quoting what one of our amazing professors Kim Elam said while talking about Apple and design. *"For once superior design wins!*" I just wanted to personally email Apple and let you know I am heart broken to hear that we lost it's creator and innovator. Steve Jobs your my inspiration! We should all learn from this great man and "Think Different" &nbsp;Multimedia Designer 
 He was a great man, innovator, and visionary and will be greatly missed.   His mark on the world in undeniable and will be remembered with the  likes of Edison, Garcia, and Newton for his impact and vision.  I wish  his spirit well, and his soul to flourish with all the well wishes of  the millions who will remember him forever, and pass his legacy on into  future generations.
My honest condolences to family and friends... he was the giant and will remain.
I'm deeply saddened by the news of his death, and I'm keeping his  family, and friends, in my prayers.  I have been an Apple supporter for  the last 17 years.....have worked with Mac's since high school, and will  have nothing but an Apple in my home.  I have always stood by Apple and  defended Steve against anyone who would throw a jab at him, or Apple.  I  loved how he would throw jabs right back @ his conferences, always made  me laugh and always made me look forward to hearing what he had to say.   I had truly hoped to be able to meet him one day, as I thought he was an  amazing person.  The world lost a great man.  Thank you Steve, for all  that you have done for us, you saved Apple, and gave us SO MUCH MORE!   You will me missed. :( 
Thanks for the inspiration, rest in peace.&nbsp;
Today the world has lost a genius. RIP Steve. And thanks.&nbsp;
God blessing you.  It must be great honor for me to live with you &amp; this generation which you create.  Your way how to think is the ecstasy property to the world and its world will miss you forever.  Tears will be kept on next some days, but I will soon be on usual and iPhone will make much more fun &amp; convenient for my life. Thanks, Steve and now you can take peaceful sleep.  Enjoy your sleep!
Thank you Mr. Jobs for bringing the Apple products to this world!  You will always be a great man!  We will always remember you...
Very few people will be remembered throughout history as people who   created something so great and so vast that it could ever be   forgotten. Walt Disney, Henry Ford, Sam Walton and now Steve Jobs.   Today is truly a sad day.  
Thanks for all you gave us creative professionals. You changed the way we work, think and live. then the rest of the world took hold and we will be forever grateful!
My first computer was a Performa 6500. It was too expensive, not very   capable, but it was a Mac. From the little I knew then about   computers, I knew that when I finally bought one, it would be a Mac. I knew little about computers, but I'd learned a lot about the   creativity and genius of the two people who's founded Apple, and I   wanted to be a part of it. Over the years, I wore my Apple t-shirt everywhere, and was abused. But when Steve came back and rejuvenated the company, I knew the wait   had been worth it, and that Steve would vindicate all my years of   loyalty. He did, in spades. All my years of evangelizing Macs was made worth it by Steve Jobs'   genius. Now, it's cool to love Apple and it's products. But some of us always knew and loved Apple and the man who saved it. He can never be replaced or equaled.
He taught us to dream of the future, and he taught those at Apple to build it.  I am grateful.  My condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues.
Thanks for changing the world Steve, we'll never forget you. 
God bless you Steve. The world will never be the same without you.&nbsp;
 Steve's vision and products are legendary, but the speech he delivered   at the 2005 Stanford Commencement is life changing advice.  Those   words are a gift to us all.  Thanks Steve!  Never another one like you.  God Bless!&nbsp;
I sit here with my iPhone and my iPad and my iMac, with all my records and CDs packed away, and I realize...Steve Jobs invented the 21st Century. May his vision live on.
RIP, thank you for revolutionizing the world, and condolences to your loved ones.
The mortal life is short, but the legacy is immortal. Steve was a great inventor, and inventors will be remembered for generations. &nbsp;
I am in tears as I write this. I just wanted to say that as a 17 year old student, I needed a positive role model in my life, and that's exactly what Steve was. His speeches, his inventions, his reshaping of the world, inspired me to try hard in school. He reminded me that the little details count and to always give nothing but my best. I will continue to try my best in life and make a difference.   Thank you Steve.   Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.&nbsp;
Words cannot describe what this man has done for the world.   Thoughts go out to everyone who was close to him and his family.  The world won't be the same without steve.
For a long time I wasn't a fan of Apple Computers. But the recent innovations that Mr. Jobs have introduced have undeniably changed the way people live. Such a sad day to lose one of the visionaries of our time. 
The world has lost an extraordinary person, even though i've never known  Steve personally I know that the impact of his loss has effected  millions and much more his family. I believe we will never have a  visionary like him in this lifetime. I cant offer much but my condolences  and respect for the loss that his family has to endure.  RIP STEVE  1955-2011 you will always be remembered.&nbsp;
Steve: you've been an inspiration. You'll always be. 
  STEVE JOBS...  HAS LEFT HIS MEMORY IN ALL OF US !!!!!! 20   HE STILL LIVES IN OUR HEARTS WITH ALL HE SHARED. HE IS NOT APART FROM  US BUT PART OF US!!!!
I haven't always been a fan of Apple products, being a PC user from around 5 years old (I'm almost 33 now) and having only recently converted to a MacBook Pro, but you can't deny all that he's done for the computer industry as a whole.  Some of my fondest memories as a kid were using the old Apple II systems at school, learning how to type, playing Oregon Trail, writing small programs in BASIC, and everything else we did.  From his ideas, to his charisma, you could always tell his true excitement in talking about and releasing new products.  He was a true pioneer in his field and he will be greatly missed.
Because of you and your amazingly unique gadgets, our lives have been forever altered. You had a truly one of a kind genius brain and the world will always remember you. Miss you Steve! 
For raising the standard for" amazing." For showing us all what well thought out technology can do. For making the inspiring world that was previously reserved for geeks and nerds accessible to everyone. Without Apple, I wouldn't have a job as a Final Cut Pro editor. I wouldn't be able to find just the song I needed when I'm feeling down. And I wouldn't have learned that true magic is achievable with the right mix of innovation, perseverance, and leadership.  Rest in peace, Steve.
ありがとう！ご冥福をお祈り致します。   
The world has lost a genius &amp; an amazing person, technology is what it is to day because of Steve. His Legacy will live on forever &amp; he will never be for gotten. My thoughts &amp; prayers go out to his family &amp; everyone at Apple. Rest in Peace Steve. You have changed our lives for the best &amp; I thank you for it. We love you.&nbsp;
I can't imagine life as we live it today without the intervention of Steve Jobs.  Not only as a visionary but as a man and a mentor he lead us all to a new era.  Thank you for all you have done for us.&nbsp;
   the world lost a great man..My thoughts are with all family   members, friends and apple's family. 
I am deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Steve Jobs today.  When I first heard about the passing of Mr. Jobs, the first thing I thought about was how amazing it was for one person to build a company from scratch in a single garage to something so monumental - something that certainly cannot fit in a garage any longer.  But after a while, I realized that the passing of Steve Jobs meant more than just the death of a figurehead.  To me, Steve Jobs was Santa Claus.  Every Christmas, I would wake up and hope the one thing I opened would be an iPod or a new Mac laptop, or even just a cover or a case for something.  When my dad was dying of cancer at Stony Brook University hospital in early 2005, one of the last memories of him that I remember is giving me money to go buy the new iPod and some iPod socks.  When I think back to those times, I realized that Mr. Jobs was the man that made the smile on my face possible all those times.  I am e-mailing this wonderful company because I would like to thank you all.  I know it was not just Mr. Jobs that made for such happy memories, it was all of you.  I know it is not going to be easy going to work tomorrow, knowing that such a monumental figurehead will no longer be with you.  But what you all have to remember is that myself, along with millions of Americans and billions of people all around the globe are cheering for you. Keep the tradition going.  Make Mr. Jobs proud.  We will still be behind you 100%.
Dear Steve,   Through your vision and passion for Apple were you able to change the way people around the world look at personal devices and communication. Thank you for sharing your dreams through every single personal device Apple has ever made.   As an owner of a iMac, iPad and iPod Touch, you have changed my world completely.  Steve may you rest in peace and God Speed to you and your family.&nbsp;
Hope you take beauty of technology and creativity to heaven too...  ...thank you steve&nbsp;
Wow. Steve Jobs changed technology forever and will always be in the hearts of every geek and techy always. R.I.P Steve J. 
Goodbye steve,&nbsp;even if you are&nbsp;gone, your inspiration&nbsp;and&nbsp;brilliant ideas remain in&nbsp;my head&nbsp;until the&nbsp;end of the world,&nbsp;your life&nbsp;has inspired&nbsp;many people. May you rest in peace there.
Dear APPLE,  I am  writing this email to show my greatest sympathy to the loss of the inspiring leader. He's at peace right now and his spirit will be enlighten our generation and far more influenced the next generation. He has revolutionised the way we see technology!
Steve thank you for the great products that we have. 
Thanks for giving us such an amazing product and for believing in yourself. From what we, the public, saw and knew of you was that you were a great guy with a huge talent. You will be missed and we are so thankful for you for bringing us this incredible technology and a love for the brand. We're so thankful for everything you have given us! God Bless!&nbsp;
I am deeply sorry. He will be always remembered, not only by his family and friends, but also by all the people touched by his talent. 
With his incredible vision, Steve Jobs truly made technology accessible to all people. At the Apple store, you will find three year olds using computers, iPads, and iPhones. At the same time, senior citizens are learning how to make digital movies and communicate with people in new ways. As a teacher, I appreciate his contribution to education. 
My sincere condolences goes out to his family. May God  bring comfort to his family in this time of sorrow.
You created a world beyond what we ever thought we might   be. I am humbled - honored - devastated -- all at the same moment. cannot tell you how much your vision has impacted me and made me a  better person. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an amazing individual. He broke the technology barrier that a  lot of people would not ever attempt or even see in a lifetime. We only see  this kind of person maybe once in our lifetime and we should cherish that we are so blessed. He has had me on his side with all of his products, which I  actually have a few myself. iPhone 4 32GB, 17" MacBook Pro, and a 27" iMac.  I love those machines and don't feel like any other individual could've created the empire he has built in his short lifetime. He will always be remembered.
As the sun never stops shining and love never stops giving, your vision and hard work will be remembered for centuries to come. May almight god give you rest in peace.
Someone who gave the world so much that brought happiness and joy. Gone before his time but the brightest stars always burn out the quickest.  Rest In Peace Steve - your legacy will live on in the smiles of generations to come.&nbsp;
I feel the need to express my condolences. I am 17, and growing up   watching every Keynote presentation by the man in the black turtleneck   was foundational to me. His vision has done the better part of   defining the Millennial's lifestyle, and I'm proud to say I am heavily   influenced by Apple. Everything about the company has inspired my   philosophy on technology, and guaranteed Steve Jobs' methods will   continue to be a driving force for me until, and beyond the day when   I start my first company.
I am so deeply shocked and sad right now. Mr. Steve. Jobs is such a pioneer and genius, brought profound impact on this world. He will be remembered and memorized by the world forever.  His motto "stay hungry, stay foolish" is always inspiring and encouraging me and many people.  I miss him forever.&nbsp;
At the risk of sounding like the rest of those who are emailing their thoughts, today, we've lost a very special man. I can only hope that Apple will continue forward with Steve's spirit in mind.  My most sincere condolences to his family and friends.  Forever an Apple fan.&nbsp;
This is a sad day...he was a good man who taught us that there is nothing impossible... a man who changed the life of so many people around the world, and he still lives in the hearts and minds of every fan and family... Farewell Mr. Steve Jobs...thanks for everything...we'll miss you a lot. Again thank you very much Mr. Steve for everything...
You will always be one of my heros.
 My deepest condolences to the friends and family of Mr. Jobs.  The world has lost a genius, a master mind, a Da Vinci of our time.  Will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
I like to believe that when we lose someone close to us they still live through us and give us strength. The time we have spent with those we've lost makes them part of us. The world will remember Steve Jobs as a wonderful person who changed our lives.  R.I.P Steve Jobs. &nbsp;
I'm not the type who would normally do something like this, but this nation as well as the world, has lost a true visionary.  I am at a loss for words.
It's just not going to be the same without Steve Jobs around. We are all going to miss him.
Can't believe the world has lost such an incredible mind and being. &nbsp;All I can wish is that Steve is in peace now and that his family, friends and colleagues find strength in this hard time. My deepest condolences and my utter most respect. The digital world will never be the same. Rest in Peace Steve!&nbsp;
My most sincere and deepest condolences to his family and the Apple family. What sad news.  Just recently I heard the talk he had given at Stanford University's graduation ceremony, and was amazed to learn the life he had led--not always an easy one--and the lessons he learned from it.  He had an incredible vision for what was possible... or, better yet, that nothing is impossible.  I can imagine that his creative legacy will continue to inspire many people... even though individuals like him only come around every once in a while.
Thank You Mr Jobs for thinking "outside the box".  You have been the   Einstein of our generation. We will miss you dearly 
To the family and friends of Mr. Steve Jobs,  I would like to offer my most sincere condolences and prayers for your loss. I would just like you to know that I will celebrate Mr. Jobs' legacy by continuing to be a member of the Apple ecosystem of products. After all, Mr. Jobs is a hero in my eyes for simplifying and entertaining people's lives simultaneously. Additionally, Apple's impact on the education of the world is tremendous, and the use of the iPad in this area exponentially increases that impact. While I regret not being able to meet and thank the Apple team in person for these products, Mr. Jobs' attention to detail and passion for these products is clearly visible with every swipe, tap and pinch I perform. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to give thanks through this medium, and once again, my prayers are with you all.
 The apple felt from the tree. Thank you for changing the world over the years . I'll never forget you. I hope you're in your iCloud now.
I am very sad.  Jobs was a great man.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs, I and my family will remember you forever, and mourn for many days to come. You were the genius of our time, innovative and intuitive. What you have done for us will never be forgotten. You will never be forgotten. We mourn your loss today and have one wish: that you had overcome your illness and were sill with us today. It was you who brought Apple to where they are today, you who created the most advanced computer company for the average consumer. And it will be you who will never be forgotten. Thank you, Steve.
It's a sad day, we've lost a great man, Steve Jobs, my heart is broken and truly goes out to his family and close friends.&nbsp;I'm sooooo bummed about Steve, I've been choking back tears for hours now. I worked on my first Apple Macintosh computer in 1986, it was an SE 30 w/ 9 inch black and white screen, been a fan ever since. I've owned several Macs over the years. Steve Jobs is the reason I'm a Graphic Designer today because w/out Apple I would not create, funny how you just realized who inspires you once they have passed.&nbsp;May he rest in peace and be surrounded by all the cool Apple products he created. Farewell my friend,&nbsp;you will be missed greatly.
I am where I am today because of Steve, I as a first grader back in 1981 got to use an Apple IIe for the very first time.  From that  point on I was in love with computers.  Today some 30 years later I am work ingin the computer industry as a help desk technician.  I took a while to  turn a hobby into my career but I have always credited my love of computers  to that first Apple IIe.  I have never met Steve but I feel like I would not be who I am today without his contributions to the world.  God speed Steve and my prayers are to you and your family.&nbsp;
He created the greatest technology ever.  I use it everyday at school and at home and pretty much anywhere else.  All of what he made is amazing.  He is one of the reasons our lives are so easy these days.    I will remember him for as long as I use Apple technology.
Dear Apple,  Steve Jobs, a modern day Leonardo Di Vinci of our era who and will forever be known as a legend until the end of time.  i also want to thank all Apple employees past and present who have had faith and believed in the nature and quality of your work.  Combined with Steve's inspiration and desire for creativity such wonderful synergy was born and brought about an impressive line of Apple products &amp; services.  Its always an honor to work for a company that has the capacity to influence the world and inspire future generations of innovators.  Visionaries such as Steve appear maybe once a century.  Therefore Apple I hope you continue to truly honor Steve's life work with the preservation of Steve's inspiration in all that you do... for we all receive inspiration from within ourselves.&nbsp;
Steve was an innovator and a genius. He brought some of the greatest  technology ever seen to us. The man will be thoroughly missed. He is in  our prayers.
Never met you in person, never spoke to you, yet your death feels like such a big loss. I guess that how people feel when a genius passes away. May your soul will rest in peace, Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs, He will be my icon, forever. He should inspire every Man on this Earth,  to bring the Human being technology and creativity, spilling happiness,  thus. He just changed my way to see the world and to live my life, he  was the greatest man that has ever lived. Rest in peace, Steve, and thank you for everything you've created.
I was reading email on my iPad when I received breaking news from my local news about his passing. I broke down and started to cry. A man I never met or knew personally touched my heart in so many ways. My hopes are with his family.   This was a truly truly special person. There will never be another.
Thank you for making the world colorful. Thank you for bringing Apple to  the whole world. Thank you for making people's dream come true. Good  nite.
I have been a member of the Apple family since I owned a IIE. I have supported Apple ever since. Steve always made me feel that I was home at Apple and I had total faith in whatever products he brought to market. As he always said " It Just Works" and it always has. I will miss you greatly.&nbsp;
I will forever remember Steve as being the one who merged Art and  Technology seamlessly. I will forever remember him as the visionary that  saw the big picture, and acted upon it. This man changed my life.  Nothing more needs to be said.   
R.I.P Steve Jobs! you will forever be remembered.&nbsp;
Dear Steve, You are one of the greatest inventors and businessmen in the world. &nbsp;You really did change how we live our lives each day. &nbsp;You were also a great presenter. &nbsp;It seems like only yesterday I remember going on my first cruise ship and seeing all of these small white gadgets in people's hands. Even before that, I remember using the Macintosh computers in my elementary school. &nbsp;I remember asking my parents on that cruise ship what those gadgets were. They told me it was called an iPod, a cool gadget for listening to music. &nbsp;This was back when the first iPod came out. Even though I am only fourteen years old, you have given me inspiration to pursue a career focusing in on the technology and media industry. You will be missed. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. I will miss you.  
Steve Jobs, you were an inspiration to me and a genius, and your ideas will live on for generations to come. you were truly an amazing man and will never ever be forgotten.
As a 44 year old I can say without a doubt my life has been influenced by Steve from the first day I touched my 8K Apple II in high school.  Thank you for that Steve, thank you. 
What a truly sad day.  Steve Jobs was a remarkable individual, who co-founded what is arguably America's most remarkable company.  He was a towering individual of the technology revolution, and will be sorely missed by many.  RIP Steve, we will miss you.
Hello,  I didn't know Steve personally but he has inspired me more than anyone else on the planet.   People who know me, know I love Apple.  I'm currently majoring in Game and Simulation Programming. And making video games is a dream of mine and always has been.   Seeing Steve Jobs' Stanford Commencement Speech changed my life. The quote "if today was my last day alive would I do what I'm about to do right now" is what did it.   I decided why the hell not try and reach the goal and make that dream come true.&nbsp;
  Mr. Steve jobs.   The focus is say no.  Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking, and don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.. Mr. Steve&nbsp;Jobs, wherever you are&nbsp;God is with you, you were&nbsp;and always will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;great mentor&nbsp;of media and&nbsp;technology resources available&nbsp;in the&nbsp;world&nbsp;was.  My&nbsp;condolences&nbsp;to you, with&nbsp;all due respect&nbsp;and gratitude&nbsp;for the great man&nbsp;he was.   God&nbsp;enlighten you.
I feel so sad right now. Steve you inspired me and millions of others.  If it weren't for you the tech industry wouldn't be as great as it is  today. But this isn't about the founder and ex CEO of the great company  Apple Inc. passing away this is about a great person named Steven Paul  Jobs who died and will be sincerely missed. My thoughts go to the family  first but not just them I'm sure everyone at Apple and in the world is  sad at this moment but he was a great man and is in a better place now.  RIP Steve I seriously cannot express how sad I am at this moment even  tough I didn't even now him personally. You will be missed. :'( 
Rest in peace Steve. I am sure you have gone to a very special place.
For someone I never knew personally Steve Jobs had a big impact on my life.  My first computer when I was a child (The Apple II) was his creation and without it there is no doubt that my childhood would have been a much lonelier time and I don't think I ever would have developed the love of learning that I have come to enjoy.  Thank you Steve.  You will be missed
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs! Your vision touched our world in an inexplicable   way. Your genius was unparalleled. I thank you for helping to shrink the   world, making my life more melodic, and making my work life more cool.  You   will be missed!
RIP Steve Jobs...thanks for all that you did for technology.
One of the great minds of the 21st century is gone and I don't think that anyone can achieve more in the future than Steve has achieved for the digital world in the last decade.
Hi, My name is Alivia and I am 12 years old. My whole life I have known and grown up with the products Steve jobs has helped create. Technology plays a huge part in my life and surprisingly has shaped some of who I am today.  Thanks Steve, you really helped my life become so much more simple. 
I recently purchased a iPad and macbook air while i personally do  not know him i am saddened by his loss.  My opening homepage is  apple.com and when i saw his face it made me draw tears upon his  departure.  The world lost an amazing human being. My greatest sympathy 
Steve,   Thank you for everything that you have given to us. We can only be inspired and learn from your achievements for years to come. Because of you, all of us live in a better world today.  Your work is not only a foundation of Apple but a course of development for the whole humanity. You profoundly changed our lives for better. We can't thank you enough.
From such a young age I remember the releases of all the iPods and the iPhone. Now a high schooler it is hard to believe that one of the most inspirational figures outside of my own family is gone. Steve Jobs, no matter what anyone said changed everything and affected the world in so many ways. He reinvented things over and over and over again. The phone, the tablet, the computer, the list goes on. May he continue to innovate wherever he is. Today is a very sad day.&nbsp;
er hat mein Leben zu einem großen Teil bestimmt.   Wir sehen uns wieder auf der anderen Seite.
My heartfelt sympathy goes out to Steve's Family on this sad day. Everything  I touch in my world today, has been effected by the creativeness of Steve Jobs. I owe him my thanks for all he has contributed to the World of technology. I shall miss his witty unveilings and most of all his down to Earth approach of addressing complexities. This has been the end of a great Era...or perhaps the beginning of a new one inspired by this great innovator. Part of my world has been made easier and more fun because of you Steve.
Although I never met Steve I nonetheless feel a deep personal loss as I am sure a lot of others do.  Steve was a modern day genius who made our lives more enjoyable with his creativity.     This world was blessed to have him for all too short a period of time.    May his family take comfort in knowing that thousands also share their tremendous sense of loss.  ﻿
 The world has lost a "one an only" He was an incredible person with an extraordinary passion for giving us the most unique products. We watched in awe as we waited in anticipation for his next genius creation.God Bless Steve Jobs and his family            
Thank you Mr Jobs....not many people can say they changed the world....and actually mean it!  You made it cool to be a computer nerd!  We will miss you.&nbsp;
I never met Steve and I don’t think I was even that great an Apple fan, but I felt sad when I heard the bad news. Steve was more of an icon to Apple than the apple itself. he surely had a unique personality.... may he rest in peace knowing that his legacy is much more than technology. May G-d bless his soul.
Perhaps the greatest man to have ever lived.  I wish you all the best  and hope that there will always be "One more thing." 
Although I never met Steve, although I never was in the same room as Steve, although I never even saw Steve walking down the street I feel a terrible loss &amp; want to express my sincerest condolences to his family &amp; friends.  The world has lost a great man.
You will be missed Steve. Thank you for all you have done and created.  Your  vision and achievements in technology aren't just "cool" but have made lives better and brought people closer.  You were missed when you, understandably, left apple this year and will be missed even more now that you have left us for good.  Thank you, thank you, thank you, and rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve, I never knew you in this life, but I wish you good fortune and a  meeting in passing during the next life.  I honestly thank you for the  contributions you have made and the wonders you have bestowed upon us  all.  Finally I thank you for getting me started on a path that could  have gotten me nowhere but has led me to my thirst for knowledge in all  things geek.  This is dedicated in loving memory to an icon in the Information Age.   May we continue to move forward and further our capabilities. 
Thank You Steve, for countless life enhancing contributions.  I imagined a world where you never existed and it is a much darker place that I want nothing to do with.  Instead, our lives are made much easier.  Your early contributions started a wave of technology that literally changed the world as we know it.  Your new contributions could be considered even more impressive.  The world owes you a debt that could never be re-payed in dollars, yen, or any other currency.  Every time I look at this beautiful screen with an apple silhouette I will think of you.  Thank you so, so much for everything... You will be missed.
Not only is Steve at the heart of Apple, he was behind the amazing technology and creative spirit at Pixar.  Thank you, Steve, for the wonderful gifts you gave the World.  You have changed this place for the better.
Thank you Steve for creating a culture of excellence at Apple and for never compromising on the details. Apple was our creative agency's client in the nineties. It was an extraordinary era when you re-built the company and executed your vision -- iTools, Tunes, iPhone -- and I got to be part of it in a very small way. Since then I've taken what I've learned at Apple in terms of standards and discipline, to two companies and enjoyed an exciting ride. Its been hard to reproduce what I experienced at Apple. I am just glad to have been working under your visionary leadership and to have had a part in your history in my small, modest way. You will be missed and what you taught me will remain stamped in my dna for the rest of my career and life.&nbsp;
Genius! He inspired me in so many ways since my very first Apple II. Now I am  typing in a Mac. I do have my memories, and he is part of it. RIP Steve 
This is a man who has made me who I am today. The creations for which Steve and APPLE have introduced to the world, are something that will change the face of technology forever. I have been working on APPLE computers all my life and have grown to appreciate what it has done for me and my family.   Thank you Steve and everyone at APPLE. Keep it up!
I just wanted to say that as an 18 year old no one has inspired me more than Steve Jobs.  Mr. Jobs has inspired me, to always keep innovating, never say that's good enough, and even to go to school for IT and one day I hope to have the honor of working for Apple, the amazing company that Steve Jobs created. My thoughts and prayers to the Jobs family and Apple employees as we go through this difficult time. I would like us to remember Steve Jobs as a visionary who revolutionized the way we interact with our technology in a magical way. I wish you all the best.
I want to thank Steve Jobs family for sharing him with the world. His  presence will greatly be missed, his contributions, everlasting. Thank  you, Steve, for your dedication to perfecting your products before we,  your customer, even knew what we needed. God bless you and your family. 
God bless,  The world has lost a great man in Steve Jobs,  our thoughts to his family, friends and work colleagues.
Thanks for helping us to think different!&nbsp;
We will miss you Steve Jobs. You were a man before your time. To the Jobs family-The entire Apple community mourns with you.
I feel honored to have lived in the era of Steve Jobs- a visionary for our times.  
You will always be remembered as one of the greatest minds of all time. You will never be replaced. My house contains several (pretty much all) Apple products. You were and will always be, one of my heroes. My condolences to the Jobs family and to everyone who mourns the loss of this great man around the world. You will forever be missed. &nbsp;
Simply Thank you. You have change not only my life but the life of billions of people. You have inspire me in my career. You have inspire me to become a better person an d a better professional. We haven't lost you. You will remain in the memory of each and every person whom with your creativity, passion and intelligence you've inspired them. Thank you.&nbsp;
It's a very sad. One of my goals in life was to meet Steve Jobs. He has been  a motivating figure for me in my life. I look at his success and realize anything is possible. Steve embodied the American dream. I'm truly sad that I will never have the opportunity to meet such a brilliant mind.
My prayers go out to the Jobs family and the Apple family. I'd like to thank Mr. Jobs for all of the ingenuity wisdom he has brought to this generation. He will be truly missed. 
 Thank you Steve for the vision you have shared with us, the world. Thank you  for the technology you have introduced to our lives that we can't live without now.  May you finally be at a place of peace and rest.  God bless.  You will be dearly missed.  Thank you.  Love and condolences to your loved ones.&nbsp;
Just to share our condolences from Mexico, The world has lost one of  the greatest geniuses ever. &nbsp;Thank you Steve for making technology so fun and grab to everyone. rest  in peace
The world lost a genius! He shall be remembered and missed forever!
My heart is broken. As a young adult, wandering the creative fields, my life was given a singular focus and drive when I discovered my first Macintosh computer, many years ago. I have become a driven and successful person because of it.  Thank you Mr. Jobs. You saved my life and made it what it is today.  I already miss you like I've known you all my life.
I am a huge supporter of Apple, I have been all my life as I am 22.   Steve Jobs was such a visionary that he was able to usher in a whole   new era of technology and to that, it really means a lot for the   world. He has touched every single one of us in some way shape or   form. Even though I never got to meet him, I knew a lot about him and   considered him my idol, my superman of technology if you will. To the   entire Jobs family and friends, my deepest condolences for your loss.   To Apple you lost a father, but you will pull through. Rest in Peace   Steve Jobs.
As a teacher I would like to say that Steve Jobs and Apple have impacted so many young lives.  The technology is world class just like the man who created it.  He will surely be missed.
Didn't know you...But "i" will miss you - You changed our world one Apple at a time !!  R.I.P. Steve Jobs - Leanardo DaVinci of the Modern World !!  Think Different .........Yes.......... "i" do&nbsp;
Dear Steve, I never got a chance to meet you, but followed your career and was a fan  of your products. You shall forever be remembered! The world has lost a  remarkable mind and a pioneer today, one that taught us how to endure  adversity and face unfavorable odds. May you rest among the stars, where you truly belong!&nbsp;
I've been crying since your passing. You introduced a new world to me, one that'll never be the same again. You did your thing, man. You went out like a  lion. Wherever you are now, I wanna see it revolutionized by the time I get  there.  With infinite love
Heartfelt condolences to Steve's family and loved ones. His products have changed the way I do business and his story gives me inspiration to achieve great things. RIP
You have inspired so many... You will be missed...  So long Steve!   
May your soul rest in peace Steve. You ruled the world.
 I'm korean. When I met your company's product I think It is awesome. And I've got that over and over again. You are my mentor. I live in Korea but I will remember you forever. I hope you rest in peace.
In a sentence,   "He changed the world.  My world." Thank you, Steve.  You've NO idea how much of a legacy you have.  Millions of people  just like me, will bask in it every day.  You have no idea how much you will be missed by the millions of us who never even got to know you personally.  You never knew me, yet, you changed my life.  A heartfelt, thanks.  You will be sorely missed.
The world lost. The world cries. The world looks back and seeks understanding of who this man was. The world looks at you, and you've modified the creations of man. Just great. Just jobs.
To Mr Steve Jobs,  We never met, and we never talked although I've sent you several emails before. It's such a pity for me that I never had the oppotunity to see you in person.  As a genius and a legendary figure that is really larger than life, you've been my mentor and changed my life. I will always remember to "Stay hungry, stay foolish." and "follow my heart".  Would like to talk to you again in several decades :-)  R.I.P 
It’s hard to believe that such as wonderful visionary will no longer be with us. Thanks to Steve for changing the face of technology and building an empire of wonder and fun for all of us!
Steve, who will be better than you? Missing you and your genious ideas!
Thank Steve for being such an innovative person, for bringing us   technology that we can be proud off, that is worth our money. Thanks   for your intelligence. We will miss you.&nbsp;
The world has lost a great man, and a great mind. Thank you, Mr Jobs,   for your vision and for ushering in so many products that have   enriched and improved our lives. My condolences to the Jobs family,   and the Apple family.
I would like to give my utmost condolence's to the Jobs family and may God bless you.  America is losing one of it's pioneers. There are only a handful of people that can be said to have left a lasting impression on the world. Steve is one of them. He will be missed. His passion, vision, drive is what will be missed by all.   Thank you for everything that you have done.  God Bless!
Steve surrounded himself with the best of the best. He was a brilliant businessman and Apple will continue with his vision at the forefront of their core mission: the enduser. RIP 
My first apple product was a macbook when I was in 3rd grade, now im in 8th and it works as fast as when I just got it. From then on, I have always looked up to Steve Jobs. This&nbsp;deeply&nbsp;sadens me of his&nbsp;death. I wish his family the best of luck.  Thank you for all you have done Apple.
Many people want to meet actors, singers, pro athletes and so forth. The one person that I ever would've wanted to meet was Steve Jobs. He was a role model and huge influence in my life. It's very hard to believe that I could feel this sad for someone that I never got to meet, and I wish I had. He will obviously always be remembered, but I will not remember him for the iPhone, MacBook or iPad that he created, but I will always remember him as the visionary that  pushed through so many boundaries even when times were tough. His products were only a result of his mentality and vision of a better future. That's how I want to live my life. He will always hold a very special place in my heart and mind.     RIP Steve Jobs
We feel so sad and sorry for this. Hope him sleep with peace. 
I owe to this man's vision, man I never met, most of what I am today. This was one of the men that makes me happy to have lived this life.
It's with a heavy heart I write this, never has the passing of someone  I've never met felt so strongly.&nbsp;Steve Jobs was an inspiration to people, not only in his own company,  but in the whole world. Truly from my heart, may he rest in peace.Thank you for all you have given us. Thank you for thinking different.  My condolences to his family, in a time like this it's hard to imagine  what you must be going through, may it bring some ease knowing that he was  a hero for many of us.&nbsp;
Thanks for Everything... You will be dearly missed... I love Apple, will always will and its all coz of you.
 I feel that one of his most enduring legacies will be that somewhere, somehow, someone will change the world (much like Steve has) - and an Apple product will be at the heart of that. 
Its been an honour and a privilege to grow up at a time, when i was little that a mac was considered a great dust collector, and nothing more. To then be in a world where the macintosh apple symbol, no longer reminds people of food but rather of one of the most impressive corporations ever built. As an innovator, the dream is always to make the world a better place or to change it in some way. Steve jobs, has personified the image of an innovator, bringing us into a world that only the creators of startrek and starwars could of imagined. He has changed the way we do everything, talk, sell, buy, share, invest, save. Through countless innovations and products, and he has made the world a better place.  I have never had the honour of meeting the man, and i really do not often bother to care about an important public figures death, let alone to write about him, or to the people close to him. But if you did have a chance to know him, you should know that steve jobs made the world a better place for all of us. May he rest in piece knowing that his legacy will have changed the face of the earth forever. And may future generations be blessed enough to know someone who has even an ounce of genius that steve had.  --
Enjoy the Cloud, Steve.  Thanks for it all. 
What a loss - it's surreal. What a strange thing to feel like I have lost a friend and a mentor - someone that I feel I knew so well even though I never knew him at all.
When I started my university in a big city, a friend showed me his IPOD, I've never seen anything like it before, it's 10 years ahead of everything. Thank you Jobs, for bring so many great creations into this world.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  it deeply saddened me today to find out you left us.  Savior of the now huge Apple Company, your views, your dreams and goals,  all together represent what a Genius is in our Modern Era.  I bid you a personal farewell, Steve even if we never met in real life.  I will surely look for you when my time comes and hopefully then I will  get to know you like I have dreamed so many times these past years.  Thank you for everything you have done for Mankind.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs, my respect to you! You are an inspiration to one and all!
  The world has lost a legendary innovator. Through your work, the world has seen massive evolution on technology. May you rest in Peace Steve Jobs, and thank you for all the contributions you have made to this world.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Dear Creative Genius, Thanks for every thing you have make it for the humanity &amp; to the computer tecnology we used every time , we will never forget you dear genius we will remember you at all time , I say for every one How see the Apple logo or used anything from Apple when you see this logo or use this product or this softwares remember this man (steve Jobs )   Sorry for my bad english that's all i can say  Thank's Steve Jobs 
This is great loss for the humanity... My most sincere condolence.&nbsp;
hello  Steve wherever you are reborn-because rebirth is a must for you as "an inventor par excellence", the earth needs you to be reborn as an inventor to provide us mortals again another example of how to fight odds and yet live every day like there is no tomorrow, inventing, reinventing and creating gadgets that makes life of mankind so easy-not realising the tragedy the inventor went thru all along  May your Soul Reinvent again.&nbsp;
The world will never forget such an amazing human being who changed people's life in more ways than we will ever imagine. Steve, you have ultimately completed your journey on earth... we will all pray for the Creator  to give your wife and kids the ability to handle and deal with such a big loss. May God accept you in his kingdom!!!!!!!
Steve will be missed. He is the Da Vinci of his time. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Putting feelings in words loses value...  He influenced not only my life with all the Apple products but most important he was the mentor i've always had next to me when making personal and business decisions. Thank you Sir Jobs.
Steve, I feel like I know you. You have had a great impact on me and  so many other lives. For me you have had the greatest impact on the  world of any man in the digital age. I will always love and treasure everything about Apple. Well done on such a good life. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
You inspired me to do what I want to do and be who I want to be... Go and shake things up there. 
Dear Steve: As a result of your life, we have a better world. You will be greatly missed.  Thanks for your creativity. &nbsp;
Steve's soul will live forever through the company that he helped shape and the company that shaped the future.  
We all thank you, Steve, for changing the way we all think and now live, for which we are indebted.  Your contributions to society cannot be matched. May your soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
we have lost one of the special person of apple. I am sad for his dead and I will pray for him and his apple
Dear Steve,  You always taught me through your energetic presence to 'love what you do and do what you love', thanks for that simple words that means a lot as a reminder to fulfill our life with passion!  Rest In Peace Steve, may God be with you.&nbsp;
To Steve's family and friends, my thoughts and prayers are with you all.&nbsp; Thank you Steve for making products that inspire and continue building our dreams into reality.
    Dear Jobs, I hope that you will live in peace and prosperity in  Heaven and continue your great career to serve the kind people in  Heaven! 
Steve, thank you. Humanity is proud of you. God bless you. You are the friend that I never met. Is so sad that you are gone, but we know that you are just waiting for us. 
 I had the pleasure of having many interactions with Steve during my seven years at Apple (1978- 1985). These were among the best years of my professional career. Steve was an inspiration to us and will be greatly missed. My wife, Lucy, joins me in extending our most sincere condolences to his family. May he rest in peace.
I have owned Apple products my whole life: from an Apple II, to a Mac 512k Enhanced, to a Performa 6300, to a Powerbook 500, to a Mac G4, to a Powerbook G4, to a 60GB Video iPod, to the original iPhone, to an iPod Shuffle, to the iPod Touch, and to an 8-Core MacPro and a MacMini. Back in the day, I even remember looking longingly at the Lisa during a trade show!  I don't consider myself a "fanboy" by any means. I can be quite critical of Apple products; oftentimes frustrated by the company's decisions.  So why keep buying Apple products?  Because they work for me.  Thank you, Steve, for providing me with the tools that have consistently made my life better.  And I look forward to a great future for your beloved company.
You were a mentor I never met. A friend I never got to know. You inspired me in ways that for the world I will now show.  Sent from my iPad, straight from my iHeart.  
I'm really sad that he died at such a young age, such a great person, such a great engineer. I cannot stop crying. He gave so much to this world.
Steve made our life better. All I can say is Thank you.&nbsp;
I was saddened to hear of the passing of Mr. Jobs. I have been an educator for 13 years and have used Apple products since I began my teaching career. Apple products have truly shaped my teaching and the way my students learn in a positive way. I have Mr. Jobs to thank for that. He will be missed.&nbsp;
 Today we just lost the single most important person who made writing this email and sending it across possible. If it werent for Mr Jobs, computers would have wound up in govt offices, multinational companies, factories,universities, all the possible places which wouldnt have been accessible for general public!  The common home users, who comprise 70% of the computer users now whould have been left aspiring to see a computer if Steve wasn't there. My gratitude and thanks to the man, an icon, an inspiration, a visionary!   The world WILL miss Steve Jobs, No one can remotely be compared to the Awe-Inspiring LEGEND&nbsp;
Steve,You're an inspiration, I live through life everyday with an apple gadget  on my hand, you certainly changed the way we lived. Thank you, may you  rest in peace.&nbsp;
The only time I have heard Steve Jobs give a speech was watching the  keynote address for one of the iPhones.  All I can remember thinking was  how charismatic he was, and I have went on to look at him as one of the  finer examples of a public speaker as I pursue a career in political  science.  Apple, and undoubtably the world, has lost a true visionary. 
My Condolences to the entire Apple community. So long Steve...you changed the way we look at computers...your innovations being the best out there! Thank you.  We'll surely miss you! Rest In Peace. A passion for creativity from a creatively passionate!
Dear Apple,     I hope that everyone at Apple can adjust to this very rough transition. Everyone will miss Steve and I hope that his family continues to improve over the coming months. He has influenced the company in many directions as well as assisted the direction of the engineers and employees.      We all appreciate you for all of your diligence in creating wonderful products and services.      Thank you.     
Dear apple members, I am sad to hear that one of your most respected colleagues has passed away. I  will hold Steve in my thoughts and may he rest in peace.  
Not only was Steve Jobs an innovative genius but a courageous soul in his fight against pancreatic cancer. His creativity is beyond words and his seemingly unfathomable creations have changed my life and countless others. He will truly be missed and I thank him for sharing his wisdom and love of life.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has brought me MANY HOURS of enjoyment and I am GRATEFUL for his life and that I shared some of my life span with him.&nbsp;
My most sincere condolences to Steve's family, friends and the whole Apple corporation worldwide.     Steve's spirit will remain with us in every iPhone, iPod, Macbook... We will never forget... We will always be inspired...     Good trip, Steve!
Steve Jobs puts the "i" in our technology. Our thoughts and prayers to the family and staff of Sir Steve Jobs. You were a LEGEND.
To The Family of Steve Jobs;  I wish to send my deepest and most sincere condolences to the family of Steve Jobs and Apple employees.  I bought my first Macintosh in 1984 inspired by the ease-of-use of Apple technology.  That initial purchase hooked me into a 27 year romance of Apple innovation, technology, and products.  Today, gray haired and aging, every time I turn-on any Apple product I admire Steve's ability to make superior products for humankind that work with minimal effort and bring great joy to use.  For me, Steve Jobs has been a visionary that enabled productivity and creativity of the first order to the end-user. I will miss his commanding presence that drove Apple to become the world premier company that it is today. Steve's spirit will live on through the products he helped create.
People such as Steve, who change the world,  come along once in a generation. All of our lives are richer because of him.  "Do not follow where the path may lead. Go, instead, where there is no path and leave a trail."
A very sad day for everyone. His brilliance and innovations have forever  changed the face of the entire world.&nbsp;
Tonight the world lost a true genius, visionary and all round incredible human being who created a company that made insanely great products that truly enriched our lives and made the everyday turmoil much easier to get through. He may be gone but will never be gone and will always live in through the products, visions and legacy he put in place. R.I.P a true legend. Warmest condolences to his family and the entire Apple family.
I didn't actually know Steve Jobs but I find myself weeping because he  has touched my life each and every day in so many ways.  The world has  truly lost a treasure of a visionary with not only the ability to see  something but to make it happen and to create a culture so dedicated to  that vision.  My condolences to the Apple family and to his family and  friends who have lost so much more.
Great person, wonderful achievements and contribution to modern  technology - World has lost a great person whose contributions will be  remembered for many many years to come. My sympathies with his friends,  colleagues and family.
R.I.P. Steve!  My deepest sympathy for the family, the friends and all the Apple’s employees.. or should i say his other family.
 I may not know Steve in person or never would have but the world has lost a great man. As president Obama said in his address. I found out about Steve"s death on my iPhone. I have always been a great admirer of Apple products and  to learn that the person behind it died tonight is a shock to me. I want to send my deepest condolences to Steve"s family. May his precious soul rest in perfect peace. We love u Steve!&nbsp;
 Since the first moment I got my hands on an Apple computer in the '80s, my world was never the same. Bye, Steve. You DID change the world.
Saskatchewan, Canada will miss you Steve. Thanks for dedicating your  life in order to improve millions more.
Dear Apple, I am so sad that you all have lost such an amazing human being. Steve  Jobs was truly a genius and will forever be missed. God bless his soul.
RIP Steve jobs, you have changed the world, you are an incredible man, no one will ever forget you, you are a legend that I honor, you have created so much and you have worked so hard, you had an incredible vision and words cannot describe my feeling and such right now, RIP Steve Jobs, I love you, I shall always love, honor and never forget you abs your impact, theres so much more I wanna say but words just can't describe... RIP Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs was an amazing man. I didn't even know him and I'm sad. I  love Apple and I know it wouldn't be what it is without Jobs. My  thoughts are with his family right now - I can't imagine how difficult  for them this must be. May he rest in peace.
Great Man, Great Visionary .....World will miss him, feels like a personal loss to me.  He will be remembered forever for what he left behind for the world.
I didn't know Steve personally … but I feel as if I have lost a true friend.  I'm sure Steve is up in Heaven right now teaching everyone how to use an Apple device! Thanks Steve for all that you have given us! The world will not be the same without you … you were truly a visionary.
Hi, i just want to say that all my thoughts goes to Steves family and that he has been a man to remembre.  Love from Norway.
He was as you say a visionary man that will be greatly missed.
感谢你为这个世界所做的贡献
Steve Jobs was a huge inspiration to my high school. We will be donating our  old computers and getting new ones soon in memory of him. Without him we wouldn't have many of our school activities. We pray to him saying thank you and rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thank you for your great devices and products. 
 Although I never met Steve Jobs, he inspired me to be more creative.    He inspired me with possibility.   I trusted Steve Jobs to create  products that made my life better.   I am sad and I will miss him.&nbsp;
Steve,  May peace be with you as you begin your next journey.
Today we lost a great man who change the way we function through technology. Steve Jobs is an inspiration for me.&nbsp;
We love you!  Thank you for everything you have done for us! 
My original Apple II.  I still have it, and got it out a few months ago to mess around with it.  Booted up like a charm.  Little did I know that this would be the beginning of a life long partnership with Apple.  RIP Steve, you've made my world a better place!  
It is sad to hear the passing of a visionary that moved the world forward and those that worked for him. Rest in peace
Dear Steve Jobs,  You were a captain and leader for me. I wish I met you.  Everyday I promise I will follow your sentence:  Stay hungry stay foolish....&nbsp;
Steve Jobs brought magic and creativity to millions of people from Hollywood movie-makers to pre-schoolers playing with their mom's iPhone. I know he has passed on his vision to people who will carry Apple into the future.  God Bless you Steve and condolences family and your extended Apple family.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a great and innovative man. I give my sincerest  condolences and wish his family and friends comfort in this hard time of  their lives. His memory will forever live on in Apple's work and in  memories of him.   I myself have not had the pleasure of meeting him. But he will live on  in my memories of his company and ideas. He will forever remain an idol  to me. To start from little and build one of the most powerful companies  in the world is inspirational, and I hope to have success in my life, as  he did his. Again, my greatest condolences to his friends and family.
All my wishes go out to Steve Jobs and his family. Truly a AMAZING man. Not only for what he has done with Apple but what he has done for the world.&nbsp;
 Thanks Steve.  You made easy  what people had thought to see difficult.  You made lovely what people had been used to see ugly .  You made colorful what people had been forced to believe dark and monotonous.   You made light what people had carried heavy.  We love you, Steve.  Enjoy watching us on CLOUD.&nbsp;
To Steve's family and all the staff at Apple,  Thank you so much for all the wonderful work and products you have given the world... I am and have been a Apple person right from the beginning. It was the only computer I could use and enjoy not only for its functionality but also because they are beautiful... I guess the creation always resembles the creator in some way and perhaps Steve was able to take the beauty of the human mind and make it oh so functional and beautiful all at the same time. The iPhone is a set beyond amazing and is so much fun... Thanks so much!  Please know I am so sorry for your loss! And so thankful and grateful for all your hard work and beautiful creations. Please keep his spirit alive through EXCELLENCE and pride in all that's come before... My deepest condolences.
It's a sad day. RIP Steve Jobs. Thanks for letting us be a part of your Apple family over the last 6 years. If you ask my two little girls who took a bite out of the Apple logo - they will answer "Steve". You'll never be forgotten.  Our thoughts are with the Jobs family during this difficult time.&nbsp;
Now that he's gone, I think it's safe to say Steve Jobs joins the ranks of Bell and Edison in the history books.  My condolences to those who will truly miss the man as well as the inventor, his family and friends.
Thank you Steve for creating a product that brought my 4 year old daughter into the world of technology.   My iPhone was the first device she learned to use, and she loves using it to this day.     I will think of you every time I see her face light up while using your product.     Thank you.
Dear Steve, Thank you for creating a culture and an environment that I am both proud to work in and invite others to experience as well, you were a modern renissance man and the truest example of a modern visionary this world had. You have been robbed from us at much too young an age. I am proud to be a member of the apple family. Goodbye Steve, and one more thing........you will be missed. 
Steve     In any place wherever  you are, we will always remember you...     Thank you for your legacy.
A true legend, pioneer and the best public speaker I have ever seen. We are truly grateful for the work he has done in the past 20 years. &nbsp;Thank you Steve and Apple.    
My partner Jim and I would like to express our sincerest condolences to  the Jobs family.   Mr. Jobs has changed our lives and the world with his  innovation.  He will be sorely missed but never forgotten.  Thank you Mr. Jobs for all that you've done for humanity.
He was for our generations what Edison must have been for the  generations of the early 1900s.&nbsp;
Thank you for making the world a better place. We will miss you. RIP Steve. 
Dear Steve,  You inspired me as a leader and human being. I will miss you.&nbsp;
I thank the man and the wisdom and creativity he built with Apple, To all employees of Apple and to Steve's family "I am so very sorry for your loss"
My deepest condolences for your loss. He's already a legend. Saludos.
For giving so much of your life to better ours. You are truly the Thomas Edison, the Albert Einstein, the Picasso of our lifetime.   God Bless You Steve
I am really saddened by the loss of Steve to this world. I have no words to express as I put my kids to bed tonight having just found out about him!  I did not know him personally but now more than ever will always feel a sense of loss and be reminded of him as I use my Apple products every day!
Dear Steve,  We miss your passion, vision, and most of all, yourself. Rest in peace.
Thank you Steve, for bringing joy and happiness to the lives of many.
 Steve, to say you changed the world is lightly touching the surface.  You now join Bill Hewlett and David Packard as extraordinary visionaries who gave us the future of business today.  Few people are so gifted.  May you rest in peace and may your foresight and creativity pass to health care to give the boot to cancer.  You will be so sorely missed in a world that is in such dire need of exceptionaries.
I did not know him personally, but he has made huge impacts on my life nonetheless. My condolences go out to those who have lost someone personal to them.
The world has lost a brilliant visionary but I'm so grateful for his contributions. He truly changed the world for the better. He will be missed. 
I am very grateful for Steve Jobs. working at the Apple Store at  Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, IL I learned my strengths and weakness.  Steve built a company that gave back in so many ways. Every product is  an investment in each customers passion. Every employee knows that they  are enriching lives with a culture that promotes individualism,  creativity, and allows everyone to live in a technological world without  the need for a degree in engineering. I will never lose what Apple gave  me; a deeper understanding of myself and the self-confidence to aim  high. Steve will be remembered fondly.&nbsp;
 Add me to the list of admirers.  Thank you, Steve Jobs for doing what you thought was right.  Nothing makes me happier than people follow their dreams. . . and you really seemed to love yours. Thank you.&nbsp;
Thank you for all these crazy ideas that changed our life's and our world. We will miss you!!!
I will feel a pang of sadness and loss every time I open up my shiny macbook pro or turn on my ipod.  I cant believe I feel so upset over a man I have  never met.  Rest in peace&nbsp;
The world lost the biggest star today. May he rest in peace. 
Steve Jobs helped us take the great leap forward from the first home computers to pocket-sized, touchscreen devices such as the IPhone that are so irresistably user-friendly that a baby who cannot yet fully speak or walk can use it.  Before  Steve, all I can remember is a blinking white cursor on a black screen. I studied computer science in the early 80¹s, and the arrival of the Macintosh was a revelation ­nothing less than the unforgettable 1984-style commercial would have done it justice. It was truly a beacon pointing the way to the fulfillment of technology's promise to be a friendly and useful part of our everyday lives. None of this would have happened without Steve, a visionary whose guidance has helped touch every part of the way we work, communicate, create and play.  Thank you Steve, for all you have done for this world ­ you will forever be a part of us.&nbsp;
A great and brilliant man, a great visionary, more than that, I would say he is the "greatest salesman in the world".      As a Filipino who utilizes and enjoys the technologies he has revolutionized in this part of the world, his breakthroughs will be sorely missed.     Rest in Peace Steve Jobs, though the whole world mourns your passing, it greatly appreciates your unrivaled contribution to mankind in the area of technology. You are a legend.     God Bless.
We were pioneers with Steve, purchasing one of the first Mac computers for our design company and have been with him ever since. We are devastated and stunned. No words can express our sorrow. We feel like we have lost a brother....Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends and to all those whose lives he touched and changed. 
Rest in Peace Steve....what a brilliant mind he had. I've been an apple fan since I owned my first, an apple iic.  Thank you  for all the joy you've given your customers and fans.  Thank you for  making technology fun!  God bless.
    So sad and sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs. A magnificent human being, a man that worked every day to see his dreams come true, a man that not only gave us amazing technology, but gave us a daily remembering of the things that we can do if we have faith, and if we work hard for what we want. He was a genius, a person that will be remembered forever, a very important part of the history of humanity. I know for sure that he is resting in peace now, and he is happy. We will meet you on the other side, Steve. Thank you for everything.
Thank you for the innovations that changed the world. Thank you for the products that made our lives better. Thank you for the ideas ahead of their times. Thank for taking the path untraveled while charting a new trail. Thank you for making the impossible seem not only possible but probable. Thank you. Rest in Peace, Steve.
Thanks for all your hard work and dedication to changing the world, you will be missed dearly ... My condolences to his family....  Rest in Peace my friend..... 
Goodbye from Brazil Steve Jobs.  People like you make me proud of being human.
What a sad day. My deepest condolences to the the family of this visionary, Steve Jobs. My deepest condolences to his friends, colleagues, and all those he has affected with his work - which is everyone. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for making it so easy for me to send a picture of my baby niece and nephew to my family all the way in Eastern Europe in less than a second. Because of you, your vision, your innovation, your genius, the thousands of miles that once separated me from my family no longer exist.  You will be missed, but never forgotten, as you have certainly left many wonderful marks in the world. Rest in Peace. 
We will miss your creative genius! May your next life be as great! 
Dear Steve, As I'm sending you this email through my iPhone, Its an amazing feeling knowing that I was blessed to be in your time and see all your hard work and dedication you have done for the world!! Rest in peace Steve and I want you to know this that there's no one like you and there won't be one! Ever!
 I remember Steve Jobs... the beginning of a new age of innovation. From the time that he began his career with technology, to the period in which he sought out the best of the best ideas. Today, I still utilize all my Apple products, because that spirit of Steve Jobs is with me and my family. Some of us may think of him the next day as someone who just recently passed away; he brought the goodness and memories into our hearts. I still will remember always the Mr. Jobs who brought the word "Apple" to a whole new meaning. One day we will all look back in our pasts and mourn the time of which Jobs created a blockbuster company so enormous, the world will see to it that everyone buys at least one product from the Apple website for centuries.  My deepest condolences, a true fan of the modern technology and the man behind it: Steve Jobs. (R.I.P. 1955 - 2011)               
Rest in peace...  Thank you for the better world we live in... 
I am so sad :( Thank you, Steve. For all you've done for all of us. I am from Sao Paulo, Brasil.  It's a sad day here ... All my condolence for the family ...
I remember the Apple IIe. Just starting High School, and taking this crazy computer class, I knew  that Apple was on to something. About a 2 dozen Apple desktops, laptops, ipods, iTouchs, and soon to be  my first iPhone later, I can only say thank you to Steve for all he did.  His journey; success, failure, and then greater success, has been a  guiding example to how I have lived my life.  Never afraid to tell us what we want, he did it his own way, and has  inspired the NeXT generation of human digital harmony....   at least I hope so.  My condolences to all of you at Apple, you will miss him, but I am sure  that his spirit will guide your continued innovation.  Thank You Steve!  and Thank you Apple!
I want to say, that I'm really sad right now. My  thoughts are with his family and friends. It is a inner necessity to me to write a little note to express why Steve had an impact on my  personality. It wasn't his sucsess, or the admiration other people had  for him. It was, primarily, his tenacity in belief that he would achieve  something, if he just worked hard enough – against all expectations or  doubts. I am just 24 and sometimes I have doubts myself, if I will  achieve something of value in my life. But if I listen to Steve, an  interview, speech or keynote, I think to myself "he did something great,  because he loved it so much" and if I can mobilize the same energy and  passion, maybe I can do the same.  He is a Guidance to me, and he ever will be.  Thank you.
Steve,  I'm speechless. But i can not let you go before saying this to you. I'm just a regular guy from the netherlands and i want to thank you for inspirering me by your way of life, your vision and making your dreams come true. You are my one and only hero! &nbsp;
What a sad sad day. I never met him but he inspired me so much throughout my  life. What he accomplished was akin to the Thomas Eddison &amp; Albert Einstein's of the world and even though it is crazy for someone who has never met him, I felt so sad inside when I found out.  He inspired me to dream about technology in a way that no one else has or probably ever will.  For that I am selfishly sad to hear of his passing and think he will continue to inspire me like he always has.  My prayers are with him and his family tonight. Thank you Steve, thank you!
I write this on my iPad, I thank you for my iPhone, iPod touch, and my iMac.  You made my life a little better and happier. Steve jobs, you will be missed.&nbsp;
We have lost a great Icon today. My heart goes out to the Jobs family during this difficult time.
To Mr. Jobs Family, Friends &amp; Team,  Please take comfort in knowing so many of us out here admired,  respected, and truly appreciated Mr. Jobs.  Mr. Jobs fascination and  obsession in developing something the common man could use and love is  our loss as well.  God Bless All of You.&nbsp;
I am blessed to live while Steve Jobs was alive. He has affected my life.  I will remember him every time I use my apple products!
Well Done Steve, you left your mark on the world. Congratulations on all  your achievements in Life, You should be proud....  Rest in Peace Steve.
   To the family, friends and colleagues of the late Steve Jobs, I offer my sincere condolences.     The fact that so many of us, from disparate countries and backgrounds, mourn the passing of this  great technological visionary of the generation is testament to the impact of his creative genius.     He changed the tech world.  Not many people manage that in their lifetimes.     I share your sadness.&nbsp;
Hi Steve,  You are the best computer scientist ever, combining all the technologies to build a nearly perfect system: Apple. The world remembers you, and we love you. Thank you.
 I hereby give my message after the great man who was Steve Jobs. With his genius changed the world. In his private life, the family grew. An incredible human being, a visionary who was always on the cutting edge of innovation in the world. Pixar has created, and who made great films that delighted children and adults around the world. Apple's revamped image, creating great products like the iPod, iPad, the iPhone and Macintosh. He fought bravely, so far as he could, but unfortunately he left, although it was the best way possible: along with the family, quietly. Apple would not be as large as it is today without a major assist him, without his ideas, his genius and creativity. Sleep in peace Steve Jobs.
This is a truly sad day.   Steve was an ikon in the growth of the computer as a humanized tool. His creative genius had us wanting products that didn't exists until Steve told us and sold us on the concept. He achieved a standard that will likely never be duplicated again.   We will miss his creative genius.
Deepest Sympathy to Steve's family, friends and colleagues. A truly remarkable man who did amazing things in such a short life.  It's a dark day, but today when I put my ipod on I will take a moment to remember the man who brought us such technology.  RIP
We will miss you Steve Jobs. The things you have created,  changed,  and innovated will always be in our hearts and hands. Thank you for the wonderful world of Apple and the innovation that has been experienced with the world. 
he was an exceptional human. a person class apart.his loss is a big loss to IT world 
steve,   I cannot tell you how much you touched and changed our lives in ways we could never have imagined. I live in Egypt and I remember when the Ipod first came out in the US how much I wanted it and how much I wanted to explore this new world that everyone is talking about. I called my uncle who lives in rochester, NY and I said “get me that ipod when you get here in a month. And I want the black one.” When I got it I felt extreme happiness. The amount of music that I had on that ipod was so huge that my mom said “The man who created that thing created an addiction.” But soon enough she became addicted herself since she bought the apple Iphone. All I want to say is thank you for taking us on a journey and showing us a beautiful world that we never thought existed.   Thank you steve and RIP.
He was a genius. The one of my generation. RIP Steve.
You will be remembered by the world.  You have touched the world in moving us forward in technology. There was never a feeling of we can't do that in the Apple world.  I will miss seeing you on Keynotes seeing what your next surprise would be. You can rest in peace knowing that your legacy will live on.&nbsp;
First of all, my sincerest condolences to the Jobs family as well as the  entire Apple family.  Being on stage, knowing what we didn't know,  couldn't have been easy.  While I never met Steve Jobs, I'm incredibly saddened by his passing  because I know that his vision has revolutionized how I use and  conceptualize technology.  Aesthetically-stunning designs, intuitive  user interfaces, a committment to quality.  So here's to the crazy one. The misfit. The rebel. The troublemaker. The  round peg in the square hole. The one who saw things differently.  He  wasn't fond of rules, and he had no respect for the status quo.  We can  quote him, disagree with him, glorify or vilify him.  About the only  thing we can't do is ignore him because he changed things. He pushed the  human race forward. And while some may see him as the crazy one, we saw  genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change  the world are the ones who do.  And he did.  Goodbye Steve. 
Dear apple i am sorry for your lose steve was truly a great man and did not deserve to die at such a young age. He was a visionary a true icon of of the brightness ahead in our future. Steve jobs was the face of apple but i believe you can manage without him you are the greatest people in the world I want to say thank you for all you have done for this world i have not had the pleasure of being to any of your events or test many of your devices but based on what i have i would have to say your company will live on forever and no event or tragedy will stop you Apple is Apple and i am very pleased to say Good Luck to you and please accept my  Condolences.
Thank you for inspiring us, for helping me realize that the dots are connected in retrospect.
I've through this email, to offer my condolences to the honorable man Steve Jobs. My English is not of much use, but I always had great admiration for this man. All citizens who knew and admired his work feel a great loss not only in America but also around the world.  I currently live in Brazil and despite the little knowledge I have about this amazing man, I can say I'm really saddened by this loss so early.  May he rest in peace and your path be illuminated by divine light, God bless.  After a great living, Steve Jobs and his teachings has to be taken as an inspiration to future generations.  Thank you for this opportunity to express my feelings for the loss of a man who for me will always be a global icon.&nbsp;
No words can describe what you have brought to mankind. A human beyond this world you have lived the example of how to pursue life right on every level.  Thank you!
The tears that fall today are all for you you've touched us all, you've made the world a better place so let's not be sad you achieved so much, in so little time thank you, may you rest and your brilliance shine for many years to come. 
i think of him  every time i text on my iphone  i think of him every time i type on my mac i think of him every time i listen to my ipod... 
Thank you for all you done for the world of computing. You will be blessed. 
Thank you for all you have done for the industry you will be missed.&nbsp;
Thank you. Nothing more than that. 
Steve jobs was a WORLD LEGEND!! Steve jobs was not an american hero, he was a global one. Apple has affected many peoples lives immensely! he was the reason i  could study, work, play and have fun with my macbook,ipad, iphone and  iPod. &nbsp;Its his passion and drive that played a major part in the world we  live in. Just try to imagine a world without an iphone or ipod. I believe that he was so driven by the idea of his illness and through  the last five years he shocked the world with phenomenal inventions  after the other. When i heard the news i got up and prayed to god that he may rest in  peace for the joy and happines he brought me and my family, first time i  got up and prayed in a really long time.  R.I.P Mr. Steve!! You will always be remembered as the man who changed the world for many  of us. Thank You from a proud owner of an iphone, a macbook, an ipad and ipod  which i will cherish for as long as i live as a testament of your great  achievement. 
Thank you for changing our world and making it better. We are all saddened tonight but it brings us great comfort to know that Steve is in an awesome place that is bigger &amp; better than us humans can comprehend.  My love &amp; condolences to his family.&nbsp;
I feel very sad and actually weep for someone I have never met before. But Steve Job was a  big part of my work and social life. He will truly be missed.&nbsp; My deepest sympathy to the family, colleagues and friends of Steve. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.
Thank you for giving us the tools and the inspiration to make our dreams come true.
Thank you for this. You were truly an innovator, and a little piece of this world has gone with you. 
Steve's vision has forever changed the world and helped make it a better  place. Steve was a genius, a true original, a humanitarian. The world  lost a great man. RIP Steve!   
From another technology evangelist, you've transformed the way we work, think and live in the information age.  We'll miss you Steve, but rest assured in the knowledge your legacy will live on in the hearts and minds of all of us who knew or knew of you.&nbsp;
I'm so shocked to see this news on the website. I wish he can pass the sickness but this happened too soon. Steve Jobs is truly an amazing human being. Not only did he change the way how we use the smart phone but he also changed the way we listen to music. His speech at the 2005 Stanford Commencement is really inspiring to me. I'll looking forward to make my future better with it. Also im sorry about Steve Jobs loss to his family and friends. RIP Steve Jobs. You will always in our memories. 
Our condolences to his family. The world has lost a very humble genius! 
I never had the opportunity to talk with Steve in person, but my family and I feel deeply saddened, almost as if we just lost a member of our own family...    Thank you Steve, for your passion and creativity that revolutionized the world.  You will be missed, but never forgotten.    My family wishes to pass along our sympathy and heartfelt prayers to the entire Jobs' family in their time of grief.
 The world has lost a visionary today! I truly feel humanity is worse off wit hout him! For years Steve and Apple have brought the world to our finger tips.  Please try your hardest to continue to change how billions of us work an d live.  Thank you for giving me a chance to express how I feel about his passing.
Thank you Steve!
I am so saddened about Steve Jobs passing away at such a young age. I am almost the same age as him, and although, as a layman  I was never an expert in any of the hi tech stuff; but as a consumer I always admired him for his innovation, intelligence, design , and how easy his products were to use. Just the opposite other’s products that were designed without a thought, and cumbersome to use. It is so sad to imagine such a genius had to face and experience failure , and the stress he must have felt when seeing his company, producing the best product on the planet going bankrupt. It must have taken a toll. He is gone from this earth, but will be remembered and live forever. Great man indeed.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for all of your electronical wisdom and every thing you have created and gave us you will be greatly missed. 
 Dear Steve Jobs, thank you for all my apple computers I have used the last 18 years, and all the accompanying gadgets you dreamed up. May your crossing be in love. Several months back I watched a talk he gave to Stanford students and it really inspired me. "Stay hungry, Stay foolish" RIP Steve.
In 2002 I received my first IPod for my 13th birthday, which along with ITunes, opened my eyes and ears to the world of music and what it had to offer. Because of him and his wonderful device I have gained a hobby that I will truly treasure forever. Thank You Mr. Jobs, I am honored to be an IPod owner. May god bless you and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you very much....   PEACE !!&nbsp;
 As I sit here tonight in front of my iMac I am just so thankful he was here to create these wonderful products for us. How much I love, appreciate my never fails me computer and my iPod Classic. Everyone one of us who owns an Apple product should take a moment for Steve tonight.  
I am so sorry to hear this very sad news.  His pass away is not just the loss of Apple, it is a loss for the Mankind as whole.  I Just hope all people in Apple will carry on his creativeness and visionary forever.
Thanks to Steve for being the CEO of Apple, and inventing such great machinery. RIP Steve Jobs. We'll miss you Steve! 
Mr. Jobs, you have changed the world. You are the greatest innovator of all time. You will be forever missed!!  Rest your soul. You and your work will never be forgotten. You truly changed the world.
Thank you for everything. You were one of the few people who set out selflessly to make this world a better place for every single person on this planet. You were stolen like so many other brilliant people from us, you will be missed and will be forever in our and mind and hearts. Sleep tight, steve. xxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
We are not good with words...THANK YOU MR. JOBS, THANK YOU!!!
What you did, changed the world. I have to thank you for changing my world for the better. In that your inventions and&nbsp;foresight&nbsp; have improved my life 100%. My family sends&nbsp;sincere&nbsp; condolences to the family ,those at Apple Co., and the world cries with all of you who have benefited from all his accomplishments.
No one will ever be able to fill the space you've left vacant. My prayers for your family, and may you Rest in iPeace.
I was sorry to hear about the passing of Steve. I have always admired  and definitely feel so influenced by him in my daily use of my imac and  iphone. He was an extraordinary guy and I just discovered that we had  something in common I didn't realize..India..I was a seeker there in  '71. I saw a video online where he quoted  Gretzky...I skate to where  the puck is going to be ..not where it has been. That definitely was  Jobs from my limited perspective..a visionary..before his  time...anticipating, inviting and greeting change. I hope we do him  proud and use the technology to collectively move forward and meet the  challenges of lifetimes..to embrace our humanity wholeheartedly and  create a better world&nbsp;
Defined the millenniums first decade. Rest in peace Steve 
Our world won't be the same without you.... Rest in peace.
    To Apple &amp; friends &amp; family: Just thoughts of sadness for the loss of the greatest innovator &amp; greatest genius of our time.
Thank you very much, Steve. We lost a great, creative and visionary mind. You turn my life and my work more easy and fun.
I recently just bought my first Mac. It is a beautiful thing. On Facebook I saw that Steve Jobs had passed, and people were posting his speech at Stanford. I watched it, and cried as I mourned for someone I didn't know, but who's genius I was using to watch the video. While I was crying, I was reflecting on what he said and trying to take it to heart. Steve Jobs advocated for being your best self and loving what you do, and then showed us how through his tremendous life. The crying was brought on by the sadness his family must feel, but also the joy of seeing how people a person's life really can be, even if tragically cut short. I closed my computer and tried to concentrate on my school work, but couldn't get it off my mind. When I opened up my internet browser, the apple website popped up (my homepage), and I am so grateful for the opportunity to send my condolences. Thank you for that. My thoughts are with him and his family and with Apple and Pixar and everything he touched.&nbsp;
So sad to hear this news, I literally got home from work and jumped   back on my home computer and once the apple website came up I heard   this sad news. I have been working with his visionary products for the   past 20 years and certainly remember my first MAC computer, that was   released in 1984. I was designing some layouts for a brochure and it   was pure magic and certainly something new to discover and learn. I   have been a loyal follower ever since.  My condolences to his family, and may he rest in peace. 
Steve,  Thanks for bringing us life, music, fun in a easy and cool way. I am sure that you'll  improve heaven a lot before we go. You're the man! You'll be missed.  Rest In Coolness.
The news hit me quite hard and I am deeply saddened by your passing. You were such an unrivaled visionary. The world would not be the same were it not for your genius. Thank you for never settling and for being the driver behind  the creation of the many Apple products that I own and love.&nbsp;
 I just wanted to say thank you to Steve Jobs for everything he did to revolutionize the computer/tablet and smartphone industry......nothing will ever compare to your creative genius and the world is a much duller place now that you're gone! Thank god we still have the iPad2 to keep a smile on our faces on this very sad day.  Rest in Peace Steve, you will be missed more than you would've ever realized!&nbsp;
We will miss you!  But most of all we thank you for your vision, your determination, and bringing a bit of class into a seemingly boring industry.  I am sure this has been said before, but you changed an MCSE into a Mac Evangelist.
Dear Apple,  I was extremely sorry to hear of the loss of such a great mind, a great visionary and most of all a great man. Although I did not know him personally, it seams whenever I would watch an interview or a presentation he would give announcing a new innovative product, I felt like I did. He will be greatly missed by everyone all around the world. My condolances to his Apple family and most importantly to his immediate family. Rest in peace Steve Jobs!
We will not forget you, the way you change the world is different from others. Thank you for your effort to us.
Steve Jobs is truly a "world hero"  for his valuable contributions to  mankind. His contributions has changed the lifestyle of almost every  people in the world and in the way we do business. We and the next  generation ahead will surely remember you as an amazing human being. 
As an aspiring journalist, I am deeply at a loss for words. I can't fathom the idea of such a terrible loss in modern technology, but his legacy in the company and in the minds of future innovators, will indeed live on. My heart goes out to his family, and the Apple Inc. "family" as well.
It is truly sad to hear that Steve Jobs has actually passed away at   only 56. Even though he has been suffering for the last decade, it   feels like it couldn't be true. He has changed the world in so many   ways and has shown people that following your passion will lead to   great things. Thank you Steve.
Thank you for making me fall in love with the tools of my trade.&nbsp;
I never expected to feel so touched by the death of a man I have never personally met, yet when I read the news of Steve's passing I felt incredibly sad.  Because of Apple, computers are fun.  That can never be taken away.    He is gone far too young, but will always be remembered. R.I.P Steve.&nbsp;
I'm so sad to hear that we have lost an amazing genius.&nbsp;
It's truly an honor to be in the same era as you. You are true inspiration to pretty much everyone in any field in the technology domain. I hope apple continues it's growth as you have envisioned despite losing one of it's greatest contributors.  May your soul rest in peace.  Sent from my iPad - that you have invented. 
Steve Jobs, the visionary, has given all of us square pegs, inspiration to change the world.&nbsp; Your legend will accelerate into the future and will take with it all the dreamers who will accomplish great things.&nbsp; Cancer may stop the body, but the soul will forever move on.&nbsp; Peace, love and beautiful memories to all who&nbsp;mourn him.
What Steve Jobs has done with Apple will forever change how the world computes and communicates. His legacy will live on for many, many years to come. I lost my Dad to cancer in March of 2009. Our family sends sincere sympathy to the Jobs family and to his work family as well.
 Thanks Steve.  You showed the world computers are for all of us!
The amazing thing is that Steve Jobs will live on in our hearts......... and  in our iPods and in our iPhones and in our iPads and in our MacBooks.....and again in our hearts! GB &amp; RIP!
My life would not be what it is with out Apple and Steve Jobs. I learned math on a power mac.  I learned my trade on an iMac. I send my wife love on an iPhone. I'm inspired by the music on my iPod. I write on a Macbook Pro. I dream of one day owning an iPad. Through these devices I see the world, a world changed for the better, because of Steve. Long live Apple. And thank you Steve you will be remembered always.
Steve Jobs changed my life.  I build iPhone apps, and that's why I can live so happy.  Thank you so much Steve.  I wanted you to live a long.
Even though you knew it was coming it was crushing none the less.  One  of our worlds greatest visionaries is gone.  The world will never be the  same because of him or after him. 
You will forever be remembered as the greatest inventor, that our generation has ever seen. You're an inspiration to us all. 
 Thank you a million Steve for all the magic machines you blessed my life with!
May God bless Steve and his family. He was truly an amazing man who gave so much to this world without compromising who he was. RIP Steve, you will be missed by millions, but never forgotten. Your legacy,  Apple, will go on forever. You have changed the world!&nbsp;
I never actually met Steve Jobs, but used to run into him in Palo Alto when we lived near his home. Once, waiting to cross the street at a light, I looked up and there he was, a couple feet away. I recognized him but didn't want to bother him. I was excited and in my head I was saying, "Hey Steve! I love what you do", but I just smiled. He smiled back a warm smile, the crosswalk light turned green and we went on about our way. It was my little brush with greatness.   I've been a fan from the early days of the Mac, and while I'm sad about his passing, I'm thrilled that he did what he did that affects so many lives in such cool and amazing ways. For that, I'm forever grateful for Steve Jobs.
    Querido Steve.. Jamas he podido conocerte pero siento que siempre estas al lado inspirandome, no solo con tus comentarios sobre como se puede volver a renacer desde la nada sino como se puede volver a vivir. Hoy te toca partir hacia la meca de la informatica, espero que donde estes puedas seguir igual de vivo e innovador, quien dice quiza hasta inventes un nuevo sistema de entrada al cielo.Te mando un gran abrazo.
Thank you for everything you have done.  You are a visionary and a leader the likes of which we may never see again.
When I first started in the crazy ad biz, I was a 22-year old African American woman and my first job was at Chiat/Day. &nbsp;At my orientation, I saw the "1984" spot and thought, "Damn, I really like this whole advertising thing! And who the heck is Steve Jobs?"  Well, I never got the chance to meet Steve, but I thought then and always have ever since, that he probably has no idea how much he's done for humankind. &nbsp;I will miss his genius, his simple way of thinking and how he really made us all better. How lucky and blessed we all are to experience his genius.  What a man.   Lisa&nbsp;
 Today a light went out that lit up the world.
Dear Steve.  Thanks for creating my best notebook. You were really the creater and person  with passion.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for giving us so many amazing things in our lives.  I can say that our lives will never be the same and we have definitely become better because of it.  You have given us the opportunity to grow world wide as an Apple family.  Our bond transcends all race, sex and boundaries world wide.&nbsp;
Thank you steve for everything! Just bought my first mac computer, and  Its the best purchase I have ever made, incredible design, genius behind  it. RIP, your work is greatly appreciated! 
He was the biggest innovator in this world. Losing him is like losing my mentor, my idol.  I wanted to meet him once in my life.. He will always live in my heart.... he will always be my idol...I hope to make him happy with what I do in life.  May he rest in peace!&nbsp;
Rest in peace, Steve. Condolences to family and friends. 
I thank Steve Jobs  for making our journey with computers so much fun.   For making computers/phones that  I could use, could help my kids use,   and could teach my mother to use.  And for making computers that are   a  tool and not an obstacle to creativity. Condolences to the family.   May he  rest in peace.  
RIP Steve Jobs, your genius will go down in history. To think that my  daughter has no idea who you were, I am going to change that. Thank You  for your life and your hours of devotion to shape our lifestyles today,  for the better. 
Steve Jobs RIP! Steve Jobs is always going be Apple.  I had a iPod, a Nano, on my second iPhone and have MacBook Pro. I guess you can say I'm a Apple person.  The thing I'm always going remember Steve Jobs the most is the iPod. You can hold thousands of songs in the palm of your hand, it weighed about 2 and a half pounds or less. You do not have to be bother with cassette tapes or CD's anymore.  If this do not make Steve Jobs a genius, nothing will. I enjoy my Mac Book Pro and I would never give up my iPhone. I'm always in people face saying "I got the best cell phone in the world." All because of Steve Jobs.  My prayers go out to steve Jobs family. Steve Jobs you are truly going to be missed, but never forgotten. You do have your place in History.
Without you, my life as a designer would be completely different.
RIP STEVE JOBS YOU WERE THE BEST  
I feel like I have lost someone so close to me... He is in every apple,  ipad, iphone, ipod... He was a great mentor even for those who didn't  know him... I'm a designer, and he is a leader for me, an example of  life... rest in peace Steve Jobs, and thank you for making our life easier.
I am devastated to hear of Steve's passing. Will there be another great mind like his? I prayed and prayed for his continued recovery and life. It is a loss of unimaginable magnitude. We are all so blessed to have benefited from his genius. God bless you Mr. Jobs. He was so devoted to the improvement of technology. I pray that his family realizes the impact that he had on 'everyday people' l ike me. My tears are flowing for the loss of such a great and quiet man.
If you think about it, computers would have not been the same.  He  developed the concept of a personal computer.  He made the mouse what it  is today.  He built the most valuable company in the world.  He is in a  better place now. 
Un pésame y un reconocimiento
Simply put, he inspired my generation, and generations to come, which has truly changed the world.  May he rest in peace.
The world has suddenly gone a little less bright.  Steve, it is amazing how many lives you've touched and how many more you will touch in the years ahead.  May you rest in peace.
 Steve Jobs touched my life by making great products: my first iPod was a white shuffle, my first laptop was a MacBook. These and many others I have purchased over the years have brought joy, productivity and a sense of awe. It was Steve's passion for his work, his belief in the things Apple made, that set him apart from the rest. The world is dimmer losing such a brilliant light.  My respectful condolences and thoughts to Steve's family, friends and the Apple Team.   May we all keep to belief that the world can change, and we can make it better.&nbsp;
Steve was a great inspiration for me. I am as sad as if I family member of mine has died. He is the greatest icon of technology, retail and entertainemnt history. The greatest inspirational leader of mankind. 
really i love this man i. dont knew him but i love his fighting and struggling to be one of the most noble man with his soft looking and the power of love that i can see in his eyes with strong determination he is one of the rare greatest men in our time.
You changed the world. I love Mac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Pixar.&nbsp;
He is my inspiration. Im not a techie person but his innovation inspired  to know work on my techie side.. With his innovation and technology  combined it gives me and other people to try the fast moving side of  computers.. Thank you and forever you will be in my heart and the  billions of people you inspired.
To the friends, colleagues and especially Steve's family, I wish you all my deepest condolences.    To Steve,   Thank you for reminding me to imagine again like a child.
You are the 21th century's icon  
Thank you, Steve Jobs, for changing the way I work.
You are truly one of a kind. Apple is an outstanding company and it's all  because of you. You will be missed. But you legacy will remain strong  forever.
Dear Steve Thank you for helping visually impaired people like myself to enjoy some  great innovation in technology that enabled me to read and so to speak -  "see" again. RIP&nbsp;
To the Family of Steve Jobs  His innovation changed my life.  At a young age I was given and Etch A Sketch and Piano lessons, both tools I used to express my creativity. Years later, I would find there was a tool that connected those two experiences (expressing creative thoughts via sound and vision). My career path changed forever after taking my first graphic design class in college. I switched my major from Architecture to Graphic Arts.&nbsp;  My first and only platform was Macintosh. The Mac allowed me to be hired at a company where I started as a Jr. Designer and eventually left as VP &amp; GM of Product Development and Creative. That job allowed me to see the world. That job allowed me to live a very good life.&nbsp;  So I owe my life experience to Mr. Jobs - he made it possible for me to outwardly express what I felt using my hands and my mind.&nbsp;  You will be missed tremendously but never forgotten!&nbsp;  &nbsp;
Steve was a very smart and creative guy. He had ideas of what some might have thought to be impossible and made the impossible possible. He will be missed by  me and millions more. R.I.P Dude
Thank you for making our lives so much more interesting and our futures limitless. Our hearts and minds are with your family and friends.&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs,  I know we have never met but if we had I would have thanked you and told  you about all the things that you have done for me. You devotion to your  products, company and fans was unmatched and will not be forgotten. You  are and have always been a hero to me and I wish you could here me when  I say "Thank you for being the man you were and I only wish you could  have been with us longer."
 Es una grandisima perdida para la humanidad, para la compañia y desde luego para nosotros los que nos cautivamos no solo con sus productos si no tambien con sus historias de vida.Increible pero cierto, es una pena que se haya ido pero nos ha dejado su legado. que el señor lo tenga en su gloria.
THE WORLD HAS LOST THE BIGGEST GENIUS OF THE NEW CENTURY.....HE CHANGE  THE WAY OF SEE COMMUNICATIONS.. 
RIP Mr Jobs.    I would like to thank you for being a visionary and pioneer.  I remember the first computer that I'd ever seen.   We had a computer lab in our school filled with Apples - the good ol' Macintosh.  I used to love sneaking off to the lab and playing Oregon Trail.  I learned how to type on an Apple.  I remember getting an "A+" on the first research paper that I used an Apple to generate.  Granted, the research paper was only about 3 paragraphs discussing the solar system, as understood by a 2nd grader (but I still got an A+).   I was introduced to the world wide web on an Apple.  WOW!  My first computer was one of the colorful Macs (I think from the mid/late-90's or so).  From then, as I have grown into an adult, I've purchased my own MacBook.  My iPod kept me sane in law school.  I cannot go through the day without my iPhone and I am totally in love with my iPad.  Thank you for daring to dream and changing my life.  May your legacy live on. 
steve, the speech  you gave at stanford in 2005 changed the way i see life for good. Ever since i have looked up to you, and remember your words every time i had a difficult choice to make. i have my regrets but for the most part i had succeeded in finding what i love to do, and doing it. And i owe you for that. I dont know if where ever you are now, this message will ever reach you. But rest assured your message did reach us and change us. Im still hungry im still foolish. &nbsp;Good bye! 
STEVE YOUR WORK WAS GREAT. THANKS FOR SUCH AWESOME TECHNOLOGY!&nbsp;
I'm brazilian and I would like to say that his death is a really sad notice for all the world, that will rise up tomorrow without one of it's biggest minds, and person of the XXI century. RIP Steve Jobs. 
The world has lost a creative genius tonight that no one can ever   replace. I was encouraged by my brother to switch from PC to Mac in   2007. I'd hesitated for years thinking I'd never figure 'it' out even   though my Art Director brother kept promising me Macs were user-  friendly. My world opened up after I purchased my iMac. I'll never   look back. I'll keep creating and honoring Mr. Jobs along the way, I   hope.  Thank you Steve Jobs. You will be sorely missed.
thank you very much for all you did. you ARE my hero and i will always  keep you in my thoughts.
Always and innovator and a champion. &nbsp;My prayers to all who were his family and friends.
I live in a country where almost all hope is lost. Our children's education, hopes for a good future and safety and respect for life is almost zero... But your struggle, your life and your constant battle for new ideas even in the worst days, gives me a new perspective and better hope for the future.  My heart is at a low point today. My thoughts go to your beloved wife and loved ones. Your co workers and friends. Please...take a little bit of my love and warmth from a far away place that feels closer just because of your innovative ideas! You brought the world closer..made it more like a big family.&nbsp;
My husband works for Apple.  We owe everything we have to the wonderful company Steve Jobs' ingenuity has created.  My husband has found a job he, too, is passionate about. He is working for a company he loves.  He has begun his 5th year with Apple and hopes for many to come.  Thank you, Steve Jobs. Rest in peace&nbsp;
 I am so distraught by the fact that this brilliant man is no longer among us.  He truly lived his life in a state of purpose and grace.  His vision, drive and creativity was so captivating. I am fortunate to have existed with him on this planet in his time to witness his world changing creativity.   The should change the dictionary to include:   Steve Jobs - Visionary Definition:   Brightly and intensely vivid Radiant, exceptionally clever and talented; outstanding; impressive  Synonym - Brilliant      My condolences to his family at home and at Apple.  I pray you all carry his light always.&nbsp;
...for all the inspiration, for the brilliant mind, for the help in my everyday work, for your legacy, for everything. THANK YOU, STEVE JOBS.  RIP.
To the Jobs Family thanks for your fantastic man.  He has had a huge impact on my life and family, from the humble Macintosh LC3 to the magical iPhone 4 I have loved the journey.  To my friends at Apple, Kia Kaha (stay strong).  RIP Steve. 
What a great visionary and inspiration to others.  RIP Steve.
We remember you Steve for the great contribution you made towards the way we  think of technology.  Indeed this is a dark day for us Apple fans here in Zimbabwe    We never thought we will live to see this day.  It was our hope that your sickness was a passing phase. Although you passed away like this, we gain solace in the fact that your name is forever associated with success and what hard work can do.  You left an  undying legacy and a living testimony of what commitment means in the form of Apple Inc. We will miss you, but  one day we trust we will meet in a better world.&nbsp;
When I heard the news of his death, I was on a ferry in NY, checking Facebook. The news immediately saddened my day.   I don't know what to say because I'm still in shock.  He is one of few people who can give me excitement. I always look forward to witness his creative and charismatic speech.  He gave me a lot of inspiration. He taught me the importance of time and having passion.  We lost another genius. I will miss his all-seeing insight. I wish I could have seen him.  He is now gone but he will live in my mind forever and continue giving me inspiration and teach me a lot.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for creating the iPhone which allowed us to capture the greatest moment of our lives--our sons birth!  
Thanks for changing my life.  
Hi I'm a graphic designer and fine artist. My first Mac was a 512 in 1985 and I've have numerous Macs since, including the one I'm typing this on. As an "art guy" I was never destined to be a "techie" but Apple enabled me to be one and to make a good living.Steve symbolized to me the same thing that other creative geniuses have, "Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle" – Michelangelo. He will be missed.
It's hard to lose someone who has always been in my life. I watched you change the way people listen to music, communicate, and entertain themselves. For that I thank you. Rest in peace Steve, you will never be forgotten.
Rest in peace. Your spirit will be with us every time I see the Apple logo. 
Rest In Peace Mr. Jobs. I can imagine only a few entrepreneurs that have impacted our lives so much.
Brazil is crying about this news.  We love he.  RIP, Steve. 
I'm a brazilian 13 year old boy, and I would like to offer my sincere condolences to the entire Apple Team and Steve Jobs  family. I didnt knew Jobs, but he was one of the most important and brilliant mens of the world. He really was the best, in all the ways that a human being could be, as a person and as Apple founder. I will miss him, just like billions of persons. Now Apple will never be the same again, and the world had the Biggest lost of this century.  I dont know how thinks are going to be from now, without the King of the Kings. I dont have anymore words to express how sad I am, the world wont have anybody like him again, He founded the biggest and best empire ever!I dont have words to espress how I love apple products, and Ill always be grateful to Steve Jobs for giving me the opportunity of experiencing the pleasure of having an IPhone and IPod.
It saddens me deeply to hear of the passing of this awe inspiring creative talent. Steve Jobs was a true innovator! I was always like a kid on Christmas  morning when he was about to unveil Apple's next big thing. I will always admire the design of his products and the ability to always be ahead of the competition. It should also be said, that even when the competition tried to copy, they fell way short! Congratulations on a truly lived life! I hope to feel "Christmas morning" again in your absence.  RIP Steve!
What a great loss!  Sincerest condolences to his Family and Apple.&nbsp;
My thoughts are with the entire Apple family. Having recently lost my mother, I understand how hard it is to watch a loved one decline and suddenly pass away. Please find comfort in the memories you have as the world mourns with you.&nbsp;
Steve,  RIP with the title "Innovator" "Designer" "Father" and "Passionate Giver" to the world. You just cannot imagine how much you have changed our life style in our daily life. Seems like we takes things for granted until someone close to you is gone and then you reflect back all the great things he/she done.  RIP...   we will not forget you.  the world will not forget you.   if the iPod, iPhone, iPad can speak, they too will not forget you.&nbsp;
I've never felt such a loss for someone I didn't know.  God be with you and those who knew and loved you. 
Loved you, loved your stuff, you were a class act!!  RIP 
 So so sorry to hear of Steve's passing.  My life wouldn't be the same without his extraordinary and brilliant  contribution.  I know that he gave the very very best a human being could give.  I honour and thank him from the bottom of my heart.  My love and sympathy goes out especially to his family, and to everyone  at Apple who knew him personally.  May his spirit rest in peace forever.  with love and sadness,&nbsp;
I've always been a "PC" person but admired Apple products and Steve's legacy.     If he had been a musician, he would have been John Lennon.     Thank you Steve for transforming a bit of our world into your vision for it.&nbsp;
R.I.P Steve Jobs. Not only a huge Apple fan but an even bigger Steve Jobs fan. Hopefully your in a better place.
My deepest condolences go to Mr. Jobs family and friends...  Every year I  looked forward to meeting him but that came to an end today.  I feel saddened by this news and hopeful that he left his legacy and a great company in good hands..  You will forever be remembered for what you have giving us.... You will be missed... God bless Steve!&nbsp;
A visionary who never really needed to see the future, because he built it.  Rest in Peace Steve Jobs, hoping your life could inspires others. 
Steve-  Wanted to take the time to THANK YOU for all you've done to change the world—I personally thank you for making me a proud mac. As promised on my blog, I will officially post the apple stickers everywhere I can.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve Jobs. we will always remember you by Apple.
Steve was an innovator. He changed our world, no matter how far we come from, he brought us closer. His creativity united the world in more ways than one. He opened the doors for changes in business, education, society, communication, etc. I come from Chile, but live now in Cupertino. We came here almost 20 years ago, not for the American dream, but for the dream of a company Steve founded. - Honor Steve and keep his company going!&nbsp;
I am a 53 year old graphic designer. The first computer I ever created a design on was an apple.  I have make my living on an apple nearly every day for he last 30 years and I like it.  I talk on and show people pictures of my children with my iphone.  Thanks Steve - you made my life easier I am greatful&nbsp;
I don't know what to say. It was one of my greatest wish to meet steve jobs one day in my life even only to shake hands. He was inspiring me in so many ways. I  have to say that i start to get interested in his works in the last two years , and it was for me like a new world has opend. I feel kind in the way that we have some in common, life is to short to fullfill your ideas and Steve was  just starting. He changed the world in a wonderful way, he gave the computer a taste of soul, where nobody would have ever searched for this before. Nobody &nbsp;understands humans like Steve. His empathy for humans and computer was what he was best in, he understood the needs of the people and want to make them happy. He was a good man. He will be missed. My condolence for his family and his friends, also for the Apple employees, keep working on his ideas and dreams and he will be never forgotten.&nbsp;
Good evening  I send my condolences to the family of a wonderful visionary from a   product of his genius. I purchased my first computer, MacBook. It took   some time to pick out a laptop but I knew I had to go with quality.   His passion to make life simple and functional have proven to affect   many a marketer and consumer. One thing that I noticed with my new   boyfriend is that he has a MacBook Pro. I think he's a keeper. That   was the deciding factor. I mean he has to have sense and be a good   decision maker if he has an Apple product. I can't help but smile as I   think of how my family is such an Apple family. I am sure that you all   know the impact he has had on everyone's lives.  We appreciate, admire and love his legacy.
My sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.  I have never felt compelled to write comments on blogs or websites but as I sit here at my desk in my theatre on Broadway typing this on my MacBook Pro, my iPad, which I use for reading music scores is beside me and my iPhone 4 is in my pocket. I also have an iMac in my home recording studio AND an Apple TV device!! To say this man had an impact on me personally would be an understatement to say the least.   This news was met in our orchestra pit with deep sadness and much discussion about what a true visionary he was.  His legacy will continue and his influence will be felt for many, many years.  Cheers.  
grazie Steve. 
Today the world lost a visionary, a man who worked hard to make the world a more fun place. He built a cult of die-hard fans who will NEVER give up their Apple computers. I thank him for that, my wife thanks him for that, and my kids thank him for that. Steve Jobs was one of a kind, a genius and a hero to people everywhere. RIP Steve, you will be greatly missed as we all loved you.&nbsp;
Thanks for all you gave and all you saw and passes on to us.  RIP.     
 I was saddened to see the announcement of Steve's passing.   I did not personally know the man, but his vision, his forward looking imagination, and ability to overcome great obstacles was amazing. Beyond all that though, we all could see he was struggling with his health and still managed to share his dreams and new products.   He fought a good fight.   For a man I have never met, I am in awe when I think how much of my life has been and will continue to be impacted by his life and work. Every phone call, everything I do on my lap top...my prayers are with his family and friends.&nbsp;
His famous address at Stanford University's commencement has to be one of the most touching, uplifting and inspiring speeches ever given, and remains my personal favorite. &nbsp;I hope his family as well as those closest to him are comforted by the knowledge that his genius will continue to influence and inspire people for generations to come. &nbsp;It's been a long battle; may he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thanks for steve jobs redesigning mobile phone, letting us to enjoy technology, encouraging us to design product by user experience not by what the consumer said   Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. &nbsp;Good luck in heaven.
Thanks Steve for inspiring humanity. We got a big step forward and I trully hope someone can get your torch and keep on. I'm really sad to see you go but at last you can rest in peace. Condolences for your family, friends, colleagues at Apple and everyone. You will forever live in your legacy.  Thanks a lot!
It was an honor to work for Steve Jobs, for Apple.   Today we say goodbye to a legend, to a person that came to this planet with one objective and can now rest in peace because he has achieved it: to change the world!   Thanks for being so great!   Farewell.&nbsp;
 RIP Steve Jobs.. Apple will not be the same with out you and you will truly be missed :(            
Thank you very much Steve. You will always be in my mind.
Steve Jobs has been so inspiring to me since I first got in touch with Apple at the beginning of this millenium. It actually led me to run my own blog about Apple and its products. The news about his death has caught me, like many others, completely off guard. Even if we all knew that this day would come. I can't express the sadness that I feel about it. In his visions, ideas and products Steve will always be with us. To his friends, colleagues and family I wish all the strength they need in these hard times.  Steve has changed the world and all our lifes in a way that only few people are able to and his legacy will remain for all times.  Thanks, Steve! Rest in peace.
I have owned two Apple products in my lifetime: an ipod and an iphone 4. Both were wonderful and enriched my life at different stages. Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you, Steve, for all you have done to make the world a better place. Your desire to bring innovation to the masses was truly an inspiration. May we all carry on your legacy.&nbsp;
Thank You for all you have done to better the world. The world is a less  creative place now that you are gone. RIP.
I never met Steve Jobs, but as a designer, he and his company have had such a  strong impact in my life. I use their products everyday. When I had a serious problem I could email Steve Jobs and someone would be on that Problem ricky tick.  As I said, I never met the man, but I miss and mourn him as I would a close and dear friend. Rest in Peace sir.
...changed the way I looked at computers, phones, shoot - technology even. Everything he did, he did it 110%. It's incredible.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve and strength for your family in dealing with your passing.&nbsp;
To see the looks on my 7 and 8 year old student's faces when they touch, hold, and use the ipad, gives me chills.  I am so blessed to be able to do two jobs that I'm so passionate about and intertwine them together.  This is all due to Steve Jobs.  I am a teacher and an Apple employee.  He will always be the man who saw a dream and went for it.  A dream that has forever changed the world for the better.  I am so grateful to be a part of such an extraordinary company created and perfected by him.  I send my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and Apple family.  He will truly be missed but always remembered.&nbsp;
To the team at Apple, I am so sorry for your loss and I will be thinking  of all of you tonight. Steve Jobs, you have changed the way we use  computers and phones. You have made the world ask "What's coming next?".  Thank you for changing the world. We have truly lost an incredible  innovator and a wonderfully creative man. So sorry for your loss.
  It is such a huge loss to lose a great visionary like Steve  Jobs. He has been a source of inspiration to millions of people who have  ever dreamed of following their heart and believing in themselves.&nbsp;
Steve was the most amazing genius in the entire world. We will miss him  but he left us his best legacy..... APPLE!! Thanks Steve.
Apple Family, I got to know and follow the apple after having lived in the United States and acquired one of its products and the legacy of users and fans of their developments. Employees to follow its trajectory as an example for humanity and his family my sincere sorrow for his death. Steve Jobs - rest in peace!
You showed us that things can be always beautiful better and even magical.   You inspired me to see the world with a different, design conscious and keen eye.   I will never forget that Steve Jobs designed and was on top of those little things that made apple unique and made me someone that could appreciate the beauty in details.   Let go and let Steve.
I spent all my childhood and early adulthood wishing I had an Apple  computer. I finally have a pretty, functional, amazing, creative tool.  I wouldn't  trade it for the world.  I am proud of it and what I will achieve with  it. &nbsp;Steve Jobs made it possible for artists to work.  He was an artist.   Perhaps the greatest of our time. He left a legacy and made it possible for us artists to leave our own.&nbsp;
We will all miss Steve Jobs.  He served as an inspiration to me so that when I grow up I would like to be a businessman.  As an Apple Fanboy (what my friends call me), I am most grieved by Steve Jobs's death and I thought it was really sad that he maybe didn't get to experience the new iphone 4s.  Apple was really a great company and now is and always will be my most favorite company in the world and Steve Jobs will always serve as an inspiration to me and I will never forget him. 
I was shocked nevertheless to see the message on the homepage even though it was expected. Somehow, because Steve had wildly succeeded with a second act at Apple I was also hoping it would be the same with life. The world has truly lost an amazing person. I have never met him but he has inspired me, made me more knowledgeable and my life easier, more creative. For that I thank him from the bottom of my heart. RIP Steve. 
To the entire Apple Family and Steve's family,  Our deepest condolences.  My mother and I took computer programming  classes on an Apple IIe.  My 4 year old daughter learned Dolch  words and the fascinating world and universe on a MacBookPro, iPhone and  iPad.  We come home and often each one of us has an Apple product in our  hands, catching up with parents, friends, work and the world around us.   Steve, you brought the world to our fingertips.  You have lead a team to  vision for the possibilities of humanity in so many ways. We will miss you but know that the spirit of Apple and your legacy live  on.  Thank you.  A world mourns your loss.  Simply, you live on in every  start up chime.
Steve was always ahead of his time but that never stopped him. He should  be remembered for what the younger generation can be capable of. Steve  was once young like many of us and never stopped pursuing anything he  wanted, we should all live like it is our last day. In the world we live  in today where everything is connected, mostly thanks to Steve himself,  we should always be creating and pursuing. His life will be celebrated.
RIP Steve Jobs, I will be never be able to thank him enough for my   favorite electronic devices, my dear iPhone 3 and 4 and my MacBook! :'(  I think he was one of few real visionaries in the world. I've never   felt like this with any person i didn't knew in person. It is a real   loss for the world.  My sincere condolences for his family, friends and co-workers.&nbsp;
This is a very sad moment in my life as I am a tech guru, yet also a person and understand that we all are mortal.  My thoughts and condolences go out to Steve's family and friends.  As just a consumer I would not consider myself a friend, but Steve was one of my inspirations in life.  May Steve rest in peace and his legacy live forever!
RIP Mr. Jobs. I am just a lowly end-user but I am proud to say I am an Apple end-user  thanks to your vision. I, as well as the world, can never ever say Thank You enough.&nbsp;
i feel really bad about this lost..... he was an amazing person who was  an inspiration for me and many people, i know .... when i read about the  story of his life it made realize that we can try anything we want if we  really want what we try    but i am also  happy that he is with god now  in a better place than any we know... i wish nothing but the best to his  family and friends and i have to say that in name of all the people who  owns an iphone ipod mac or ipad etc ... THANKS !! for all the things you  do because although is just a machine it represents work and commitment  and for some people more than that.... so i think you need to know all  the people that work at apple what an amazing work you are doing and  that even though steve jobs is death he shall never be forgotten... i  don.t know who is going to read this but anyway thank you for an amazing  world of innovations
Dear Steve,  You left us way too young. You made America proud. Your life story is an inspiration. You showed the benefits of bringing creativity to all aspects of life. Not only were you brilliant, you were as fun to look at as your products. You simply were well-designed.   I'm sure you're hanging out now watching angels on iPhones and God/Goddess/the Great Spirit tapping away on iPads.  Now, get some rest up there.  Condolences to all affected.
I was a Luddite.   I graduated from college in the mid '80s without once using either the school's mainframe computer or any of the personal computers that were starting to appear in dorm rooms.  I became a teacher who created tests and other class materials on a typewriter.  And then, in the early '90s, I was assigned as a duty a period each day in our school's Mac Lab.  And it changed my life.  Within a few months, I bought my first computer, a second-hand Mac Plus.  And I've owned a long string of Macs ever since.  Thank you, Steve Jobs, for -- as Poe said -- daring to dream a dream that no one dared to dream before. Thank you for making the world a better place.
He was one of the greatest businessmen in history! A visionary!
    I decided to buy my first MAC computer because of one of his speach Macworld 97... RIP... He was crazy... He was a genius...            
So happy for his life and sorry for his passing.  May warm blessings   surround each and every one of you.     
I have loved everything about my "Apple experience" so far. I admire Mr. Jobs, the vision behind this company. Even his picture is SO inspiring.  Condolences and best wishes to his family.&nbsp;
So sorry to hear the loss of a visionary individual! His memory will live in the legacy he has left behind!&nbsp;
You were a revolutionary and one of the greatest leaders and innovators in this world today. Pure genius. 
He was a unique innovator and inspired so many. He had a special style and persona. He cannot be replaced. I'm saddened today, and even though I never met him, I will be reminded of him  continuously. I will miss him dearly.&nbsp;
You have been such an inspiration to a generation.  You constantly raised the bar&nbsp;and showed the world through hard work&nbsp;and determination one can change the world.   You will be missed by all.  Rest in Peace.
In this moment of grief, let us remember that Steve Jobs was not only a visionary, but also a father, a husband, and a friend. I am neither a friend nor a relative, but just like millions of other people, I remain inspired by his dedication and perseverance to create and redefine the new present. It was Steve Job's job to believe.  I am really sorry for the loss and I can only imagine how difficult this time has to be for all the people that were closest to him. No money, no power, no prestige can ever substitute for a man of such magnitude.&nbsp;
I am Aldo a student in South East Asia. I feel so sorry knowing that Mr. Steve Jobs has passed away. For me Steve Jobs is a real genius. This world has been so advanced nowadays, it is one of what he had made. As I know most movies used his creation to do the editing, also on image industries and music industries. He had changed the trends in the world with iPhone, iPad, Macbook and so on. He had made the people in the world become closer to technology. I honestly want to see more of his creations, but unluckily he has left this world. I hope all his family and his friends can be strengthen to deal with this sad moment. Thanks Steve Jobs, how would today be without your creation?
Dear Apple Family,  I was both shocked and saddened to hear the news of Steve Jobs' death. I did not know him as a person but through his achievements he had done on Apple and Pixar. As I am writing this email staring on my IMac, I will always remember his words:  *"You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle."*  Little did I know that these words helped to guide me to choose the career path that I always dreamed of. Indeed my journey and passion with the job is just starting out, but I really do hope that I will be able to do all my works with the love and passion he had with Apple.  Please extend my sincere sympathy to your big family. My thoughts and prayers are with you all.  I know you will miss him very much as we all will. I am thankful that I had a part of him in my live and will continue to remember him as the great guy he was.
Thank you for all you have done Steve. Because of you, the world has  become a brighter place. Your innovation and groundbreaking products  will ensure that your incredibly legacy will never be forgotten.
This man affected my life deeply. He showed me how to do what you do with true love. Unfortunately death took him so early, took the man we all wanted to stay with us for so much much longer.  I love you Steve, rest in peace.
I sit on my couch with my MacBook on my lap....but I don't think about   the hardware...or even the innovation...what I think about is the   passion and the vision of an insanely great man who had the courage to   forge a path that was his and believe that by doing that the world   would be a better.  I hope I can have the courage to walk my own path with the same   conviction. 
Steve,      I never met you. I never shared a word with you, but you changed my life when i needed it. Your Stanford speech is the best I've ever listened to and it helped me when I hesitated. You were one of my heroes, I just can't believe you're gone now. I thought that only stupid people would cry when a famous person died? until this happened. I know you won't read this, but I just want to thank you for changing my life and I promise I won't let you down on this.
Dear All,   We lost a genius! I honestly hope that his spirit keep inspiring the Apple creations forever!   Thank you Steve!    
Steve has set the standard on what quality and taste means.   Everyone in this world will want their children to have that kind of taste.  This is actually a beginning (although sad) for the US. This is going to inspire the US to get back their edge  His impact is going to be bigger now than ever.&nbsp;
To our dearest Steve Jobs,  You are always our inspiration and motivation. You have changed our lives with your creation and you will always be in our hearts, forever..  With love, Your admirer 
Steve is a visionary. I cannot think of anyone else in the world I would have liked to meet, and he's gone.  I'd liked to have thanked him for all of the people in the world he has left effected. His touch has been seen everywhere.
I have tears in my eyes as I am writing this Email. I never met Steve Jobs in person but I had a relationship with him through his great apple inventions. I happened to own almost every Apple product and have been so proud of each one of them. Very often I would stack my MAC book, IPAD, IPOD &amp; I PHONE and say look I am APPLE crazy. I always said there is nothing like a Mac or an iphone and all other apple products. &nbsp;What a human being Steve Jobs must have been. What a vision he had to bring out all this. My heart is hurting and crying. I feel sad beyond words. May God rest his soul.&nbsp;
It's been a pleasure working for you Mr Jobs!  I cant imagine my life without Apple!  May you rest in peace!
I am missing Steve! 
Steve Jobs can't be gone... Steve Jobs is an apotheosis, he just can't leave  the world now. It's not right, he can't be gone! This has to be a nightmare. Steve Jobs has made me who I am today, I just can't bear this. But&nbsp;wherever&nbsp;Steve may be now, at least he has the satisfaction of knowing the entire world will miss him, and how much he affected it. So thank you Steve, wherever you are for all of the good you caused and the technological advancements you've brought that have impacted our way of life and our future. I'm crying  right now for you  Steve Jobs, you incredible man...&nbsp;
Steve, Never had the chance to meet you and yet, thru your ideas personified on Apple's devices, the legacy you leave makes you alive throughout the world. You will be sorely missed.
Steve, you are the man of the era, we really miss you.. hearty condolence..  
Rest in peace, insanely great man. Such an inspiration for all of us.
Steve Jobs Will live FOREVER! One of the greatest minds of all-time.
I would like register my deeply condolences to friends and Family.  God bless you.&nbsp;
..will be missed.      
I'm not going to lie. I'm a PC user and have never really been a fan of Macs. But I can't deny what a revolutionary Steve Jobs was. The man changed what is expected of our computers, tablets, cell phones, music players, etc. Just about everything that we have today is based off of the model that Steve Jobs presented us. But more important than all these technological models he presented the world, he gave us a model of how we should be as humans. His charitable works, his desire to strive to be the best he could be, and his persistance to never forget who he was at heart despite all his succes is an inspiration to everyone.  RIP Steve Jobs... you will be missed. 
Steve you will forever be remembered with your products and all those who have tried and will continue to try to improve on your genius...you have laid a foundation for many.&nbsp;
I will always remember my first experience with an Apple in the  classroom.  It was in Minot, ND.  We watched as the rings of Saturn were  painted on the green screen monitor of the Apple II.  Thanks for all you did for education!  Your expertise and your  willingness to work for the end user experience will be greatly missed.
      Just in time to see his genius transform mankind onto a new trajectory of mind over matter. Thank you Steve Jobs for your all. Rest now in peace.&nbsp;
In Pace Requiscat  
Dear Steve,  Thank you so much for giving us these gorgeous apple products. I love  them! Now, I'm using your MacBook Pro to e-mail you. I'm using your  iphone to call my friends. I'm using your itouch to listening to music.  You will live with us forever!!
as a young elementary school principal in the san francisco unified school district i both met a computer and apple for the first time as i unpacked a box to uncover the apple lle which was shipped with a 'logo' floppy disk...  i placed the logo disk into the computer and following the directions typed in a series of commands which created a geometric shape, i then hit the return key and the shape rotated on the screen !!!!!!! whoa !!!!!!  in that  moment i vowed to place one of these incredible machines into each classroom in my school - language development, mathematics, problem solving, researching etc etc the possibilities and realities were endless   from each new version of computer from then to the ipod to my current mac book pro and ipad 2 i have been an apple devotee - my own abilities to function and make a contibution to the world in ways beyond myself constantly enhanced by steve jobs' genius and foresight  too short a life for his family and friends and colleagues - a burst of genius for the world that rivals any  his contributions will live on and grow.
I guess a higher power wanted the iPhone as well.  You are truly an inspiration to all.
 It is really hard to say goodbye to you. It is so sad. I am a computer science student and you are the role model of our lives. We will always remember you. R.I.P. Steve jobs.
Steve,  The way you have shaped this company since you took aver has been  amazing. With your help and guidance, you have built amazing retail  stores all over the world that promote well-made products and a very  customer-service oriented atmosphere. I can't tell you how much I wanted  a job at the Apple store purely because of the amazing and refreshing  store experience. Three months ago, I got my wish and I've enjoyed every  single moment working at the Apple store, I am truly surrounded by  absolutely wonderful people; people that you have helped shape.  Thank you for your wonderful ideas, your wonderful products and your  wonderful spirit.  You will truly be missed.
I am sorry the death of Steve Jobs, a brilliant  creative and excellent businessman. A pride for your country.
The would would have been a different place without Steve. There was and will forever be only one Steve Jobs. Truly an amazing person who will be remember and celebrated for years to come.  
So He took Steve home.&nbsp; We are thankful that we were able to have him here with us for a time. His brilliance and determination are a roadmap for success to young people everywhere. We pray for peace for his famly and friends.   "Remember to always be kind.&nbsp; Everyone is fighting their own battle".
I was not ever lucky enough to meet Steve in person, but today I almost feel like I've lost a friend. Nobody I know can deny the impact Steve Jobs has made in his short time on Earth. For me, I have considered Steve a role model for many years. I can truly say I've never watched as many CEOs deliver products, keynotes, or speeches as well and as intelligently as Steve had. I admire Steve not only because he created countless inspirational, revolutionary, and paradigm-shifting products, but because he had the courage to follow his dreams and create multiple companies that have changed the way we all look at the world. To quote Apple's "Think Different" campaign, "Here’s to the crazy ones. The rebels. The troublemakers. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do." Rest in peace, Steve. I hope you know what an amazing and inspirational legacy you have left behind.
I will sincerely miss Steve.  I've been an Apple fan boy since i got my iPod touch 2 years ago and it has been my dream since to meet Mr  Jobs.  My friends and I will miss him very much.  He has changed this world with Apple and I know my life has been changed by the remarkable products Apple has produced.  R.I.P. Steve, Greatly Missed, Forever Remembered.
REST IN PEACE. My dear friend, you made this tech world what it is now.  You build a company with an amazing future my friend. We will miss you! And all the geeks, nerds, and mac users in the world love you very much.  I'm one of your biggest fans, my friend. You'll always be in my heart as the  man of the hour :'( You will be missed dearly. A Genius in the making and one of the greatest innovators of technology  of 2 Generations! R.I.P Steve Jobs. 
Very sorry to hear of Steve's passing. As a teacher, I used Macs every  day, and I held up Steve as an example for my inner-city kids to aspire  to. Steve democratized computing. He was the modern equivalent of  Gutenberg,with the same kind of revolutionary results. I am deeply  saddened. My heart goes out to his family.&nbsp;
Today we lost someone who really changed the world for many.  I want to thank you for making my life easier and more fun with your  inventions.  I hope you rest in peace, wherever you are! You will be remembered forever! &nbsp;
Thank you Steve.  I've used your products from the beginning and have  never wavered.  Thank You, Thank You, Thank You.&nbsp;
He is a great man, and we will miss him.
:((((( 
Dear Steve,  I come from a communist country where everything was gray. With your vision you show me that the world can be better. You are the one who changed my life and I love you. You changed the world. Where ever you are. 
Thank you, Mr. Jobs. You made life infinitely better and more creative ever since my first keystroke on an Apple II. You will be missed.&nbsp;
Thanks to Steve Jobs for changing the world. He will be missed. Keep his family in my thoughts and prayers. 
In the 1970s a young man didn't know he would change the world forever with a machine named after a fruit: Apple. God rest your soul, Steve. All that is left now to say is: Thank you..... 
The ordinary person on the street treasured Steve, along with those who  were in his circle of life on this planet.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a visionary, and a role model for me. I am 17 years old  and the President of my school and tomorrow I will transmit everybody my  feeling of how we have lost a wonderful human being that has inspire  generations.  Rest in peace Steve Jobs.  My condolences to the Jobs family and to all the Apple Corporation.
Thank you so much for bringing some of today's coolest technology. Tech world will never be the same without you. You will never be forgotten. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.
Im so saddened to hear of Steve's death. He truly is the meaning of an innovator. I remember buying the first ipod years ago and how it changed music forever with itunes. Only for Steve I have an iPhone and I will never buy anything else!!  Rest in Peace now Steve you are on the way to Paradise!!  Lots of Love.
I started with an Atari 800 in the early 80's. My wife worked at a computer store and brought home the first Mac before they went on sale. This engaged me in the "computer world" and did more to advance my career than any other  single thing. It allowed me to write spreadsheets to better manage operatio ns at my company. I have Steve Jobs and Apple to thank for me being able to give my family a life they might not otherwise had. He not only did this for me but multitudes of other people. He will be known as the most significant person of my generation.
I just want to say thanks Steve for creating Apple. I own a MacBook Air and 4 iPods, and I can't tell you how important these devices are to my life. My music, my thoughts, my memories, everything is there. And that wouldn't be possible without the work of Steve Jobs and of you guys at Apple. So again thank you a million times for improving my life, and I want to give you my heartfelt condolences in this sad day.&nbsp;
My entire graphics career was shaped by Steve Jobs' vision of how computers should be for real people. 
The iPhone that Steve Jobs has created has been more than a huge part of my life, as well as many other peoples. Only someone with a mind as brilliant as his could provide the world with technology with the capabilities instilled in all of the apple products. Even though not many of us were able to meet Steve Jobs or get to know him personally, everytime someone picks up an iPhone, iPod, or iPad it will be used in memory of Steve. As we continue to upgrade with Apple, every purchase, phone call, text, and download will be figuratively dialing into Steve's soul. These devices are now more than a phone, tablet, computer, and walkman, we all have a piece of Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Although this is a sad day I thank God for blessing us with the legacy and genius of Steve Jobs. I pray that his friends and family will find the peace and comfort that they seek.
It was great at the time, but my cassette Walkman had so many imperfecti­ons. When the incredible iPod arrived, it simply blew it away, as well as the ghetto blaster! I still have my analog machines but cannot live without my iPod. He will be mentioned in the same breath as Isaac Newton, Thomas Edison and Bill Gates. The legend lives on. If nothing else, thank you for this wonderful music machine, Steve. 56 was much too early for you to leave us. Your legacy will be immortal. R.I.P.
My 4 year old daughter has cerebral palsy and can't speak, or walk. She is learning how to communicate, using your iPad. That machine is an absolute good ­ and because of it her life is becoming a better one.
Steve jobs was only of a small number of people that told me or shown me that success and happiness means being who you are, chasing your dreams and inspiring others along the way.  Thank you Steve Jobs for inspiring a nerdy country boy of Northeast Louisiana.
 Steve Jobs, you will always be my hero.  You are an example for me and for my friends. You are an inspiration. YOU WILL BE ALWAYS IN MY HEART, IN MY MIND.&nbsp;
The happiest life I've ever had was based on your creation.  So...  Thank you, Mr. Apple! 
I'm writting this letter because for me the news is not easy, for me steve jobs was more than a common person, for me was the man who give me the biggest lessons in my live. I learned so much from him without met him. he was and is my idol, because he can prove that we can do what we have in mind, we only have to wait for points to join in the future and we will see what has happened. He was a person who cannot see to the future, but he'd know what to do when the moment came. I'm so sorry.
Steve Jobs,a genius,a great CEO,a great designer, People in whole world will miss him I love him!!!  God Bless him 
Steve Jobs was a great visionary, who's life has changed the way we view technology forever ... R.I.P Steve.
I never met Steve Jobs, but he has been an important part of my life for thirty years.  As an educator and technologist, Apple and Steve have been a partner and inspiration for that entire time, becoming even more relevant and important in the later years than ever before.  Thank you, Steve, for the gifts you gave the world through your design.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
What an amazing man Steve was. The imprint he has left on this world is amazing, and everyone has benefited from being touched by his vision for the future.   My love and thoughts go out to his wife and family who have lost a great man.    Warmest regards
Wow, I don't even now where to begin...  I suppose writing this e-mail will express the loss millions all over the globe are expressing at this very moment. I am recent convert to the Apple phenomena and have come to appreciate the leadership that has steered this company straight into the face of the future. Apple will undoubtedly continue to redefine how we interact with technology, but sadly that journey will have continue without the man who brought us here. SEE YOU IN TECH PARADISE!
No fair. So young. So much more to give.  Thank you, Steve, for fixing the Apple tree.   
I'm so sad to have never met him personally, he's a man of substance beyond anyone else in existence.  Not a day goes by I don't think about Steve, and I say that honestly. Every time I boot up my Mac and hear that iconic "bong," I think of him. He's been my inspiration, and will always be.  Please, rest happily knowing you've changed the world, forever. You've made every day just a little more fun. 
Steve Jobs will live on through all of his creations and unbelievable   creativity.  Every time one sees the apple sign, ipods, ipads,   iphones, desktops, notebooks, and the&nbsp;list goes on and on forever he   will be remembered, his face will come to light and&nbsp;all the love and   respect we all have for him&nbsp;will be passed on through generations to   come.  He will never be forgotten.  My heart and soul goes out to his family and friends at this difficult   time and I am sending healing and loving karma to all.  He will live   on for eternity.  Thank you Steve for all you have given to us.  Your love of knowing   there is always more out there to learn, share and experience will   carry on through all the lives you have touched.  A true apple believer and forever will be. 
3 years ago, I got my first iPod nano, and I found I love this product. I started to buy them. I have nano, shuffle, touch, iPhone, iPad, MacBook, apple tv. I love all the products. And Steve Jobs is the most important memory of Apple. The black shirt, jean and the glasses. These are icons of apple. I'm so glad to see apple has became the most successful company in the world. I'm proud that I loved, love, will still love apple! Thank you, Jobs! Thank you for bringing the perfect and wonderful products. I'll remember you. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs. My prayers are with your family in this hour of need, as they prepare to lay you to rest.&nbsp; May your company always live on, and let it be as you wished it to be, and never anything different. Fair winds and following seas.&nbsp;
Dear Steve and His Family,  I would like to express my most sincere condolences on the loss of great visionary person, Steve Jobs.  I and our children owed many thing from you.  Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
Such a sad day for Apple and most of all for Steve Jobs' family. He was far too young! But he leaves behind a great legacy in the Apple brand and lived a pretty amazing live. RIP, Steve!&nbsp;
The legacy of Steve Jobs is present in all the people whom in any kind improved our life.&nbsp;
I know you are not reading this, but I just wanted to let you know that  you made such an amazing difference in my life, and billions of others.  You have empowered our lives with amazing technology and innovation that  only could come from Apple. You will be missed by millions.&nbsp;
I'll never forget standing in line at the Seybold Conference in San Francisco for over an hour just to shake hands with Steve. 
My 2-1/2 yr old son may not know a time when Steve was alive, but his lifestyle would have been impacted in a big way by Jobs' innovation.  Condolences to the Jobs and Apple family.&nbsp;
Somewhere in heaven, Steve is showing God that "there's an app for that". Thanks for sharing your genius. 
Remembering a man of inspirational words and unforgettable deeds. I shed a tear for those who loved him most and wish them peace in this time.&nbsp;
Years from now his name will be in the history books next to some of the greatest minds and inventors of all time. He's a modern day version along the likes of Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison and even Albert Einstein.He's changed our daily life.
r.i.p. steve jobs. you will be deary missed all over the nation..all over the world! you've given us so much, and with that your life and your spirit will be remembered for all time! &lt;3 :'(  
You don't know me Mr Jobs but I, a 17 year old boy followed the beauty of your work.. I wish you could have lived longer. The world loved your work, your ideas and inventions flowed out of your brilliant brain like the waves in a river. I hope you passed peacefully and I hope, wherever you are you continue to make the world a better place. The billions of people in this mac filled globe bless you Steve Jobs. Love &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  People Of The World...   may you rest in peace.  Steve Jobs, your family will always stay close to you no matter where heaven takes you, no matter how far you go your family and your world is with... you.
Dear Steve,    You have been such an inspiring man and I thank you immensely  for everything you have done. You are a brave, creative person and you  will be missed. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thank u for being an entrepreneur.... thank u for being a visionary..... thank u for leading a global tech leader..... thank u for made this world more accessible for through APPLE computers.&nbsp;
You helped create the wonderful life I now live and you made the world a better place. I am forever in your debt. Thank you.  Oh, and one more thing...  I will always endeavor to stay hungry and foolish.&nbsp;
God, that Hurts! Now he's a Legend.
Dear Mr. Jobs fellows,  It's definitely a remarkable loss to the world and our lives. Mr. Jobs DID a difference and changed the world as he thought and as he could. Shall his soul rest in peace and he'll be doing his new role in Apple from, as he said "somewhere else".  My deepest feelings as a consumer, admirer and human being to the family of the iconic man of our life-time.&nbsp;
Aloha and mahalo, Steve Jobs.   You made Planet Earth a more interesting  place to live.  Thank you for all  your vision and direction.  Please send me  an email to let me know that  you've arrived there safely.  If anyone can do  this, you can. Looking  forward to meeting you in Cyberspace.&nbsp;
Whether it's an iPod or iPhone, we all have a piece of him...his dream...and his legacy in our pockets. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. Your family, friends, coworkers and the world will miss you. &nbsp;&nbsp;
A wonderful innovator. A true master. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
We send our deepest sympathies to Steve's family and his friends.  We greatly admire and admired Steve. Calling him a visionary seems too   tame. We are so happy that he graced the planet.  We are, always have been, and always will be an Apple family.  Thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
We will miss you steve jobs. You were a great CEO. Rest in Peace. Apple will be the best forever. 
I was shocked by the news that Mr.jobs passed away.  I have admired his speech “connecting the dots...”   Its in my mind forever.     It was too early death.  I can’t believe and I don’t want to believe he is dead.     The world has lost a precious human beings.  He is great.  He is a only person who is built a “PC world”     His distinguished services will remain forever.&nbsp;
We mourn over the death of him.&nbsp; He did not go away from us, I believe. He'll be in our mind forever and ever.&nbsp;
What a genius!  I'm sad that we've lost one of the truly great innovators of our time.  A man who truly knew how to paint a vision, lead and inspire.  He'll be missed!
Dear Steve,  Thanks for the lasting impact on the world you have created. We are many holding a little piece of you in our hands on a daily basis and looking good at the same time. &nbsp;
Thank you Steve for having the vision to build one of the finest  products I have ever owned.&nbsp;
My condolences to Mr. Jobs' family. This is a very sad time for them,  and they are sharing it with the world. His family and his co-workers  are in my thoughts and prayers at this traumatic time. Thank you for so willingly sharing this inspirational man with us.&nbsp;
I will always remember you and your great inventions and ideas .. You may rest in peace and will always remember you .... 
Steve Jobs was the inspiration of generations, an innovative spirit   that will always be present in the hearts and minds of the many who   lived through recurring far-reaching change that he influenced.  I spent over two decades in the graphics arts industry. I was there at   the beginning, traveled paperlessly with a Mac Duo in hand [now tucked   away in my memorabilia] and witnessed the disruption begin with   typography - a lost art-ist, and the many years that followed N E X T.  Peace be with you Steve - just a customer influenced by you.  
I am truly and deeply saddened. As I write this on my much-used and much-loved MacBook, I am overwhelmed. You changed the world in ways I never thought any one man ever could. You will live forever and beyond in the revolutionary products you leave behind.  In awe and sorrow
I am truly sorry to learn of Steve Jobs's death.  I just wanted to extend my condolences to Mr. Job's family and to say thank you to this email address because it is the only place I can.  Steve Jobs has inspired me in so many ways and has changed my life for the better.  Thank you Mr. Jobs.
I Type this email from a product u created and write to the legacy you have left behind #RIPstevejobs you left a dent on this universe that u always wanted too and im sure u know it :'(  I cant believe this, Your a Legend..i hope i can be half the man you were.  RIP&nbsp;
 Thanks for all you have done! You revolutionized the world, and we will miss you dearly! RIP Steve Jobs! My thoughts go out to your family.  Hope for many more prosperous years for Apple and the Jobs family!             
Goodbye Mr. Jobs, you've not only changed the way we work... but also the way we think. May you rest in peace. Kosala 
Definitely without Steve the world would not be as fun, visually pleasing  and sophisticated. Thank you Steve for the great products you created.
Mr. Jobs was the greatest innovator of our time, and history will  certainly recognize the fact. He personally has made my life a more  enjoyable place. Thanks for everything, Steve, and I'm sure Heaven is a  better place. RIP. 
A sad day. I first typed a college term paper on an Apple II in 1984.    Have used many Apple products since then. Having constant internet access   through the iphone 4 I carry around seems so inevitable now that without it I   would feel I'd lost a piece of my brain.  I guess that's the mark of a   visionary product.   It's kind of heartbreaking to think of all the things that won't get   invented now.
You were the Da Vinci of our time and we can only hope that new heroes will emerge from the footsteps you've left behind. Thank you. 
He was an amazing guy, and someone that will always be admired for his intelligence and motivation that everyone wishes they could have!&nbsp;
Words cannot describe the level of gratitude the world owes Steve Jobs.   Thank you for making Apple part of my life.&nbsp;
It is a sad day. What a lost? We lost a genius who bring fantasy to reality. He will always be remembered every time when I am on my iPad, iPod and iPhone.     Thanks Steve bring us all the wonderful technology tools! 
The world has lost a truly remarkable human being and one who has changed the world and my life in an amazing way. He will be remembered forever as the man who man a persons touch a valuable thing and an imagination only limited by your thoughts.   Condolences go to his family and friends.  He may be gone but will never be forgotten!!
Bye Mr Jobs I would Like to Thank You for shared With Us your Great  Genius, You will be one of the Most Beautiful Mind of all Time, Thanks  for Improved  through your technologies Our Lives, You will always be an  Inspiring Mentor for the Next Generations. One Day I hope to Be like You  and with this big sorrow I have to say that from today the world is  poorer without You!  Rest in Peace! 
We may have lost a visionary, but we have certainly gained an angel.   Rest in peace Steve&nbsp;
I don't remember how much money I spent by your words "one more thing!". I miss your "one more thing!" so much Steve. R.I.P.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your each inspiration for our life. Hope You are in peace right now. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs left the world forever more connected; truly making it possible   for all people to live together peacefully.   Rest in Peace.
May God be with you and your family at this time. 
Steve Jobs was to Apple, what Walt was to Disney. He'll be missed dearly. 
Thank you for your vision.  You have shaped the world in immeasurable ways.   Rest in peace. 
My prayers are with the family and friends of this wonderful man. My prayers  are with the entire world as we have all been touched by this man in one form or another. Thank you Steve for your knowledge and revolutionizing technology in this world. The Lord has heard you and taken you from your pain. May  you RIP!&nbsp;
You are the reason I've become an Apple man. I remember having an old Apple desktop when i was in school when they were the best around and ever since that point i haven't had anything but Apple. You've created an amazing product leading up to my Apple iPhone 4 and everytime i look at an Apple product I will think of you. Rip my friend, you will never be forgotten.
Living, breathing, working and enjoying life here in the silicon valley from '96 and  and knowing technology geniuses such as "the great Steve Jobs" lived here amongst us, we took it for granted and now  to hear he is no longer amidst us is impossible to believe.  But Steve continues to be with us all thru his babies the gadgets me you and the kids all love and cherish!  My family and I pray for his family and friends at this sad moment.
Steve Jobs changed the way I live in multiple ways over my entire life. I am still astounded by his genius. He revolutionized the world we live and gave hope to us "different" people. I will be forever indebted to Steve Jobs and yet continuously inspired by his memory to be the best I can be, because that is what he gave us. 
I have been a "groupie" since 1984 - since the wonderful Super Bowl commercial. I will genuinely miss Steve Jobs's creativity and drive for excellence. The Mac is more than just a piece of hardware, it represents a new way to thinking about the world. And, Steve Jobs made it possible. 
Steve Jobs,  You were such a great man. We would have never gotten this far in technology if it wasn't for you. You will be missed by millions.&nbsp;
Is it too late to ask for just one more thing? :( I never met him, but it was a dream. I dreamt with the day I could go to a WWDC to say how I appreciate every single thing he did to all of us. Revolution, vision. He was a great man, and I feel I can say with all my heart in the name of everyone that I'll remember him forever.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will always be a truly great American innovator and inspiration!   Long live his spirit.......
I am not an apple fan but a great supporter of Steve. I thank him for all he has done for the computing world.      He will be sadly missed by all.     Deepest sympathy to his family and all his friends who knew him.
A most and interesting and curious man who became part of us.  He will live on in our hearts.&nbsp;
I learned about Steve Jobs and Apple through my girlfriend, who has been a   devoted admirer before I knew her. She loved the products, but most  important,  she greatly admired the passion and vision of Steve Jobs, and she had  four books  all about him. She went to every Mac World event, caught things  which were  tossed into the crowd by Jobs. She told me how charismatic he  was, that it was  like going to a revival meeting, with all the excitement. She  loved the story of  how Apple fought and won against the powerful  Microsoft. There are very few  public figures she admires, and Steve Jobs was one of  them   I don't know very much about technology, but through her I grew to also   admire the greatness of Steve Jobs. And so I am typing this with tears in my   eyes for someone I had scarcely known about a few years ago. &nbsp;As ill as he  must  have been for the last year, Jobs still took time to answer people's  emails  about his products, even debate with them. He was so devoted and  passionate  about his great love, Apple, and all it stood for. I wish I could  have  followed the whole story for as long as many have. I am glad for those  that have  been able to participate as it has all unfolded for the last  decades. Steve Jobs  will be in the pantheon of people who changed the world.
Thank you to Steve Jobs for advancing the appreciation of design as a cultural phenomenon.  Thank you for making good design accessible and setting the bar for the necessity for intuitive use, and the elimination of needless complexity. Your influence will surely endure.&nbsp;
To all at Apple,  Please accept my sincere condolences for the passing of the great man  Steve Jobs.  I am truly grateful for for all he has given and for all Apple has  taught me.  Eternally grateful. 
Ele trouxe encantamento e alegria à minha vida. Eu estava cansado dos produtos medíocres que seus concorrentes lançavam e ainda lançam, então quando pude compra um macbook tudo mudou.  Ele foi a pessoa que mais admirei em toda a minha vida e nesse momento posso dizer que compartilho da dor que seus colaboradores e amigos sentem porque, de certa forma ele faz parte da minha vida.  Que seu espírito mantenha-se impregnado na Apple e que seu legado seja respeitado. &nbsp;
Honored to live in the same era as Steve Jobs - Our modern day Edison. &nbsp;My condolences to everyone in the Apple family.&nbsp;
Thank You Steve for my MacBook Pro. I was a PC user for many years, but since last year I changed to Mac and now, I love it. It's  the best computer ever. Thank you for your passion and your efforts, your legacy will live forever in our lives. See you in heaven, dear Steve, create iPads there too :)&nbsp;
He was for me the ideal human being. A great dreamer, a great leader, and a wonderful man, and my personal hero. He was the man, that everything he's done were always inspiring. Thank you for all you gives to us, and for your legacy, that I hope will live for ever.
My biggest condolences to the friends and family of Steve. His Stanford Commencement Speech changed my life, he will be greatly missed. 
To a great man and amazing visionary; a genius Steve Jobs. My family and I send the most heartfelt condolences to all Apple family.  Steve remains in our hearts.
Dear Steve jobs,   I only found out about your death 2 minutes ago and I was  shocked to hear of your death. I think the world has lost a very  important person. You single handedly created the best industry and  company the world has ever known. You are brilliant, you made products  before people knew that they needed them. You were the reason that I  love apple today. I am only 14 years old but someday I want to be just  like you. I am so sad of your death. No one will ever forget you. Rest  in Peace.&nbsp;
The world is dimmer today, the night sky has a new light that shines bright.  Steve Jobs inventions brought me education, introduced me to my future career, brought music into my life, helped me keep close to my friends and family that were miles and oceans away...  but most importantly he and Apple gave my husband and I the tools to break the wall that autism built in our son. His great dreams and making them reality helps us keep our son's dreams alive.  For that we will be forever grateful.Thank You Steve! Keep Dreaming!  Our thoughts &amp; Prayers to his family and friends.
I am just an 18 year old man who is extremely happy with his Apple  products.  But I would hope that someone from Jobs' family will read  this.  I have always thought that Steve Jobs was one of the most genius,  intellectual, master of his craft, people of our modern society.  He was  truly a perfect human being.  I read that he took 1 dollar a year for  salary.  I'm sure that has only been for a limited time, but the fact  that that was the type of person he was says a lot.  Jobs was a god of  technology and one hell of a great guy.  I wish I could have met him  myself.  He will be missed by  everyone.  I hope Jobs' family will be  able to deal with their loss positively.   Sincerely, someone who actually cares. 
What inspired me most was his ability to change his focus from fighting Microsoft and others to embracing other technical powers to build better devices , technologies, and partnerships in order to create the best products and services for all customers. And create an envy in Apple's competitors! God bless you, Mr. Jobs! 
Steve will never die. He will live forever in every piece of Apple  technology we love so much.  My condolences to the family and Apple staff.&nbsp;
we lost the last bright mind of the 20th century... i'm a mac user since 1992...now i got 24 years old... my life turn  around the simplicity of the things... and around of the philosophy of  "think different"... we can make the difference making a simple life...  Steve make our life so simple...<div><br></div><div>i'm thankful for all this things... this differences and simple  things...  we will miss you steve!... see you some day... in some iCloud in the sunny sky... all my condolences to the Steve's family, and to the Apple's family.  Steve: thanks for all!&nbsp;</div>
I feel like losing Steve Jobs is a big event in our lives.  I will remember how I found out like any other big event.  My roommate was on his computer and found out through a website when it didn't even get to any other main news sites yet.  I immediately pulled out my iPhone to begin looking through news apps for confirmation to no avail.  It was kind of ironic to be searching for the news of Jobs' passing with the iPhone he created.  It's a sad day...I only hope that Apple continues this visionary's legacy by continuing to make amazing products.  I hope the revolution Apple has created will not pass with Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
To the Jobs family and all his friends, my family is very sorry for your loss. Thank you for making such amazing products that keep our family connected and encourage our growth. Our son has known how to work our iPhones since he was 2, he is now 5. Thank you for the amazing memories around your products and the ones we can capture.
Steve may have past in his physical form, but his spirit will alwais be  with you. He was an idol to many, and a father, and a husband. He was very  intelligent, and truly inspiring, I wish the best for all his friends and family.
I'm 16 years old and Steve Jobs has been one of my biggest inspirations. I use a lot of his speeches and quotes as guidelines on how to live my life. He changed and innovated the world. The world became better because of him. Even  though he has passed away, his legacy of apple gadgets will live on. I bet heaven will be full of gadgets now.&nbsp;
Steve was a good figure to follow and imitate, always was a good example that nothing is impossible, you just need to be constant and have a vision.  i feel so sad for his death, but the entire world lost  a brilliant mind, and a excellent human being.  I'll always remember u.     
No one knew what I wanted like Steve Jobs did.  He knew how my mind  worked- that was his vision thing.
Steve Jobs what an amazing person. I send my condolences to your family and your company. May God Bless you and your family. Rest in peace and free of pain.
Steve,  I have been sitting in front of my MacBook, thinking of what to write to  express our appreciation, gratitude towards you........but I just  couldn't find the most exact, powerful words........   Your  accomplishment is so so great that it's not 'words' can describe..... 
Will always live in our hearts Steve, Thanks for showing us how to think  different. RIP.  
He created the best equipment for us to defend orangutans, especially iPhoto.  Hope to see you again in the next life.
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. It was you who was the deciding factor which helped me purchase my first phone, the iPhone 4. 
 I'm from Brazil and since a started using apple with my macbook and iPhone, things have been so much easier and fun that i cannot imagine myself using another brand, so i just want to say thank you for such a beautiful mind and for having shared it with so many of us.  My condolences.
You'll be missed Steve.  Our prayers go to you and your loved ones.  Best wishes. 
No doubt that he changed the face of society with his immeasurable talent and vision.  So sorry to hear of his passing.  May he rest in peace.  
Dear Steve,  Rest in peace. Thank you for bringing me to an iWorld. It has been   beautiful for me ever since I purchased an iPod shuffle when I was in   primary school. You have made our life so much easier. I am proud of   you! Your Stanford speech is my life motivation. You will be missed.
Steve Jobs has been a lifelong hero of mine. I bid you farewell Steve.  --  Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish 
Here's to the great one, Jobs, the whole world's memory.
The world have lost one of the greatest inventor of this time. The man who changed the way of seeing technology. All my thoughts and prayers are with his family. Rest in Peace Steve.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;今天当我听到这个噩耗，我很震惊。我知道您一直在与病魔作斗争。虽然您离开了我们，但我们会永远记得你为我们带来的无限创新科技产品。您对产品的无限最求完美的精神，会一直激励我做好自己的每一件事。祝您在天堂快乐，祝苹果公司一直如你所在的那样为我们带来极致完美的产品与梦想。 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 一路走好。
I fell very sad when i hear the news,i love apple,i like Steve Jobs, I can`t accept the truth,hope apple will become more and more better.
Steve changed the world in an elegant way.
Steve, thank you for being a mentor and a friend. Thanks for showing that what you build can change the world. I will miss you... Your time is limited..don’t waste it living someone else’s life. -Steve Jobs            
Un homme qui a fait changer ma vie, je suis un fans fini de apple,  je possede, imac,iphone 4, ipad, ipod touch, mac book pro je cherais  jamais apple.  Tu a changer ma vie steve, tu m'as fait aimee la  technologie, grece toi, je fait le metier que j'aime et  j'utilise tes technologie pour faire marcher ma business de photo.  merci, je t'oublierai jamais 
HI, I AM AN APPLE BABY.  I KNOW NOTHING ELSE.  I HEARD THE NEWS AS I WAS SYNCING MY IPHONE ON MY MAC NOTEBOOK.   MY IPAD ALREADY KNEW.  APPLE IS MY WHOLE WORLD AND STEVE WAS AN ANGEL SENT TO US TO HELP US SEE THE GOOD  IN THE CORPORATE WORLD.  GIVEN THE CURRENT STRUGGLE WITH WALL STREET I HOPE WE CAN CHERISH THE VISIONARY  MAN AND CARRY ON THE LEGACY HE FOCUSED HIS LIFE ON.  IT IS A WHOLE APPLE AND WE CAN ALL TAKE A BITE.  I AND MY  FAMILY WILL MISS HIS AMAZING CONTRIBUTION TO OUR WHOLE LIFE.
News of the death of Mr. Steve Jobs was such a shock for me that I am not able to digest the fact that he is not with us any more. He has been a role model for me and all of us who are Emerging Entrepreneurs in Business.  I am a huge fan of all Apple Products and simply love the brand. I think God loves people like Mr. Steve so much that he calls them back to HIM very soon. This man came to this earth played his part so well that people though not related to him are also mourning for him. Guess this is what matters at the end for all of us. I wish that Mr. Steve rests in peace and attains a wonderful afterlife. My sincere condolences to his family - I know its a very difficult period for them and I pray GOD to give them peace during this testing time. &nbsp;
In a time when role models are card board fakes built and destroyed by the media, Steve vision and devotion to high quality standards make him a model for every young people to follow. His place on history as one of the great minds of this century is guaranteed.
I'm so greatly saddened to lose my one and only childhood hero.  I love  you Steve Jobs and I will miss you dearly.
Dear Steve,&nbsp;When I open the computer, I read the news of your pass away, I thought it was a joke.&nbsp;I try to verify this news from other official website, I can believe it is true.&nbsp;Although I did not buy any product of Apple, but Steve is mentor and a friend deep in my heart.&nbsp;Your spirit will always with me, I will miss you Steve! &nbsp;
From my first Apple IIC at age 10, I have been a MacAddict. Steve is and always will be an inspiration to me. He has affected the lives of billions of  people and many don't even know it. This is greatness! Steve, I miss you already. Apple can never be the same.
My condolences to Mr Steve Jobs family and friends.. Yet, how lucky we are to have witnessed his great mind a man who kept going till the end... To learn about great men in history books is one thing, we were very fortunate to have experienced it! Thank you for sharing your dreams come true with all of us. Rest in peace under a beautiful Apple tree....  Sincerely, &nbsp;(who cant live with out iPhone and iPod) 
I never got to meet steve jobs. but he was a friend. i would often talk to  him in my head. he was like my other. some one who would critique me. jonathan ive said that you can tell the intentions of some one or the company by  the product that they make. i felt like you knew steve becuase he put everything he had into the art that he made. ive never been sad about a celebrity. but im sad. steve jobs was an artist. he inspired people through the work that he made. my job would not exsist without steve jobs. i am going to  work towards making a brighter future like steve did.
From my first Apple 2+ that was with me through grade school to my Mac Classic that I wrote my reports on in high school to my Power Mac 7500 in college. It was Steve's products that produced a college graduate with a degree in electrical engineering. My sincerest condolences and my greatest appreciation and thanks for helping me get to where I am today. You are missed and remembered.
What would be the world without him.  My condolences. 
Our sympathies to the family of Steve Jobs. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Earth has lost a creative spark. Condolences to his family.
RIP Steve, you have inspired me all my life, you changed the world. I  have been brought up with Mac's we have never owned an PC. I'm only 14  but the impact that you had on the world was just amazing, RIP Steve :( 
As a person who has grown up with Apple and everything it has become, I  am truly saddened at the loss of Mr. Jobs. He was a true visionary and  exemplified the very definition of innovative. The world is a far better  (and convenient) place for having him in it.&nbsp;My thoughts and prayers are with both the spirit of Mr. Jobs and his  family. Rest in paradise Mr. Jobs - you will be truly missed.&nbsp;
 Dear Mr Steve Jobs,  He was and still will be a huge inspiration. His energy and presence has  made an impact on how I run my company. My sincere condolences to his  family. We've lost a true genius.&nbsp;
Steve and his company have pioneered many things that have made our world a better place. From the time I was in elementary school through my career as a journalist, I have utilized many of Apple’s systems and still enjoy using Apple equipment when given the chance. The loss of Steve’s vision, his pioneering spirit, and his desire to create advanced technology for the good of all will be greatly missed.
Mr. Steve Jobs showed an entire generation how to overcome adversity and remain committed to a vision. Anyone that has followed his career will recall the moments of triumph, but also the setbacks. These setbacks now fade into history and the lesson we can all teach our children is to persevere.  A devoted follower since 1984.&nbsp;
Steve,  You're not dead, you live in every piece of your geniality, in every  masterpiece you created that is now on the hands of millions. Thank for  your legacy. Be in peace.
 Hi Apple,  My family is so sorry to hear of the death of Steve Jobs.   He shared his vision of technology and of the future with the world, for which he will never be forgotten and missed by millions.   I have attached a picture of my daughter, she attended her first Apple launch (iPhone 3GS) when she was barely a week old in my arms. She continued with the first Gen iPad launch at 10 months old, then the iPad 2 launch at the age of 21 months old.   
Dear Family and Friends,  Let me express my sincere condolence for the departure of our dear Steve Jobs (1955).  May the Lord grant you peace as you journey home to Him in heaven, for you to continue your good work up in heaven. We will miss you here on earth but your legacy, the products you left behind for us carries your name for ever.&nbsp;
My condolences to his family and friends. I have also recently loss my grandfather to cancer, It is not something easy to deal with. My prayers go out to all those who have had the privelige of knowing him. 
Thank you, Steve Jobs for everything you gave me.  They were not just music players or phones for me...  Hope you are always happy in heaven.
 You were a total inspiration. Your vision was beyond belief. Thank you.  You will be missed.
 Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Jobs family.  Dear Steve, you will be sorely missed in this world.  There is such a sadness and emptiness tonight.  Your foresight and innovation will never be matched again in this century.  God bless you.&nbsp;
Thank you for having existed and brought such an incredible asset to the world. You shared your dream and we all embraced it. We will miss you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was one of the smartest people alive and he started a cultural revolution and therefore changed the way we looked at electronics forever. As simply a consumer, I will never forget him, rest in peace; Steve Jobs. I also would wish to send my condolences to his family, and wife, you will be in my prayers. 
Steve was an outstanding man! A true visionary and genius in my eyes. I'm speechless. He was just an amazing person and I can't put into words how much he has changed this world and how much he meant to a lot of people. You will be missed. ?  Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
The great Steve Jobs brought us not only those amazing products we have never had before. but also a faith that technology and aesthetics can change our world and our lifestyles that much, and even social culture. He struggled with his life inspiring us to fight on the road of life with self-confidence, pride and glory. R.I.P to him.
Steve,  Thanks for inspiring all of us in challenging ourselves and the status  quo. Moreover, showing us that it is just worth living if we can leave a  legacy. I am really proud to live in a time when you lived and changed  the world!!!
Thank you Steve Jobs.&nbsp;  I've grown up with Apple. Steve's vision will be greatly missed.  Sincerest condolences to his family.
Steve, rest in peace.   Your genius and singular focus transformed countless lives, allowed millions of people to earn a living, entertained us, inspired us, and changed the way we as a collective race look at ourselves and the world. Through your drive and the company you were surrounded by, you and Apple drove innovation and technology to artistic perfection.   Thank you for your contributions to this planet and the betterment of all mankind.  We know there are always people we want to hold up and celebrate, but you TRULY brought us closer together and gave us all a common and shared fabric were differences were minimized.  We have all been touched by your creations and the work of everyone at Apple.  The transforming effects of technology brought to the masses by Apple can not be easily measured.   The Planet will miss you.
Dear Steve,  Just this morning, before the news of your passing was announced, I read an article in my local paper. It mentioned an experiment that was conducted on children as young as 14 months. The children were given various mobile phones of different brands. It was noted that almost immediately, the child would make a swiping gesture on the screen of the phone, thinking the device was an iPhone &amp; expecting it to come to life.  Such is the impact of the iPhone. You have really changed the way we work, play &amp; live.  You will always be remembered, Steve.
I cannot imagine the world without the innovations that Steve Jobs gave us. I  cannot imagine the world without his brilliant mind, but know that it is a greater world because of him and now a lesser world without him. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. May they find some solace in our  deep appreciation of him and what he has given us. &nbsp;
You sir, were my idol. I cannot describe how much I miss you.                            Forever your biggest fan.
My family's condolences to the Apple family, but especially to Steve Jobs' wife and children.  We believed in him, in what he said and in what he created. I believed he would beat this illness. There is a palpable loss of energy in the world today, but his spirit, his passion and his ideas will live on.  The world is sorry for this loss.﻿
May he rest in peace! And thanks for everything he gave us during his life! For me he was a hero! he was a  person with a good imagination and perfectionism! I never get to know him I know that i will never forget him! Without him many things would not be as they are today. he open doors to a new whole new word! I just hope that the other workers at Apple keep them open! 
Steve Jobs is a legend who will be remembered for decades.  Thoughts go to his family.&nbsp;
Lina from France,  Every time I'll look my iPhone, my deepest thoughts, prayers and condolecences will be for you.  Just THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED to this creative genius.  RIP. 
Though I never knew him personally, what I do know of him is his mind. He was a modern day DaVinci. My prayers and thoughts are with his family. Steve is now in his own Cloud!
Thank you Steve. I've lived with your computer Macintosh for 10 years. I've lived with you for 10 years, and I will live with you forever.  Thank you.  This letter is written by Macintosh. 
Thank you, Mr. Jobs, for your creations, your inspiration, your courage, your life.  To his family, I pray that you all have faith in knowing that he was completed his journey and I know the Lord is saying, "WELL DONE!"  May the Lord keep you in this time of need.&nbsp;
Steve was a great man who inspired many, he was caring and created some of the best products the world has ever seen. He will always be remembered. 
Thank you.  You changed the world and will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
Thanks for reinventing the wheel.  And thanks for all the breakthroughs that went unnoticed by the mass public that helped the less-massive public. Every person that owns even 1 Apple device has been touched by your genius and ideals, and I'm sure it's made their life that much better for it.  I know it's made my life better. I'm glad you're not suffering anymore, and I hope your family and other loved ones will not be sad for long. Just wait patiently; in time, so many of your fans will see you again, when their time is up here. I wonder what you'll have in store for us on the other side.  So long, and thanks for all the apples!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs not only changed the way we interact with technology, but with ea ch other. He has taught me so much through his legendary Keynote addresses at product launches. He was a brilliant speaker who knew how to get people behind him and his product. But he was much more than that. He was the man who  co-created the world's largest company. He lived the American Dream to it's  fullest. We can all learn something from Steve, with his long fought battle  with cancer, and his strive to make something that "just works."
I am grateful to say that Steve Jobs truly changed the world during my lifetime. He is an inspiration. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
My condolences , Mr Steve Jobs is my hero, Rest In Peace
If it weren't for Apple, I would never have turned out to be me. I owe it all to Steve. I already miss you.&nbsp;
World lost a wonderful and amazing mind and real human being. Now when  we see an apple is falling off a tree, we are thinking of Adam, Newton and  Steve Jobs. He open new dimension to road of learning. I don't  know if &nbsp;Newton bit his apple or not but Adam and Steve did.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was truly a remarkable human being. His contributions to the computer world were more than innovative, they made people's lives better and brought technology to a whole new level. He made Apple products one of the few  in the world that not only did everything he said they would do, but even more. He made technology fun and easy to work with. This is what made his very first computers so popular. He cared about people and will be greatly missed by me and many others.&nbsp;
A great leader in life has passed. He taught all of us that we could trust a gain, we could trust a vision shared by so many across the world. Apple is not a company, it's a family of creative, innovative, honest human beings striving to bring this world together through technology. That's the bridge Steve had created for the Apple family and the millions of people yet to become  part of the Apple family. A legacy that few have left remains as a result of Steve's vision. Every member of the Apple family must come together and continue the broadcast of Steve's vision to the world. We are more alike than we know, Steve believed everyone could share an Apple. Thank you Steve for showing us how much we can accomplish. May God give you peace and watch over your family.  Bless you Steve.&nbsp;
If it wasn't for Steve Jobs' flare for marketing, I probably would not be owning a Mac today.  He had such a passion and enthusiasm for whatever he introduced and he practically shared his passion with everyone.  He made us believe in the products and the company.  He will truly be missed.
"He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out."
I was 16 years old when I bought my first Apple II europlus. I was a  very bad student. My first computer triggered the desire to learn and I  started an engineering degree. Today I'm 50 and I never bought anything  else than Apple computers for the last 34 years and I had a successful  career in a major Company. When my daughter was 2 years old she could  already used a mouse and therefore a Mac. Today she is 21 and of course  an Apple fan.  It has been MAGIC since the first machine till today and the MAGIC is  even more impressive machines after machines, OS after OS. iRevolution  after iRevolution!!!!  Of course Apple will continue but tonight I'm sad.
Steve Jobs taught me to love computers.  He was an innovator and  inspiring.  RIP. 
I cannot believe this day has happen I cannot imagine my life without Apple Thank you Mr Steve Jobs you will be missed but what a legacy you left behind  which in life at is what it is all about You will be missed&nbsp;
Words cannot even describe how much repsect and honor I have for this man. He was a profound genius and a creator at it's best. A perfect, if not THE perfect example of how human beings should be: Memorable.
My first ever computer was an Apple. This was when I was 8 years old. Since then, I've flip flopped between Mac and pc, but always wound up back with my macs. As a multimedia developer, the technologies that Steve has been such a huge part of creating have not only assisted with my job, but Steve himself has inspired me to continually push my everyday projects to the next level.   Thank you, Steve, for the tools to make a living and the inspiration to sculpt a career.&nbsp;
Dear the person who inspires me,  My name is Minh, born in Vietnam, study abroad in Japan and now working in here. My biggest objective in my life is creating a global tech company that combines well the beauty of technology and the exciting features of business. I love the technology especially in fields related with internet and computer. I started to push my life in this world seen I was 18 years old, now it passed 10 years but I always regret because I wanted if I could start it sooner, like you.  Apple has been giving me a lot of inspiration, and you are a star of my mind. The power and the value you show us during your working life is so strong that I can always get enough belief from that.  Your work not only gives us the best stuff but also shows us a dream about the future.  I've tried to find all of books writes about you as much as possible but there is so few. I believe people will write about you a lot seen today.  Now, I just feel appreciation for God that let you be in our world to change it and lead it in the right way of innovation and evolution. I hope you are always happy in paradise!  You are still and always the person that inspires me from now to the future.  Thank you!
We give thanks for a visionary who cared about the reason and the person about for whom his creative mind  cared.  He has done wondrous things to bring the future into the present for all people of the world. His legacy: provision of platforms for the creativity of all minds, young and old, infirm and healthy, to come to fruition. May your soul which has touched our souls rest in peace while the gifts of your mind live forever.
My heartfelt condolences to Steve's family and the whole Apple family.  Our lives were so touched by the vision and creativity of Mr. Jobs and his passing will truly leave a void in the hearts of everyone who knew him.  May his soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
Our tears are shed for Steve’s family on the loss of their husband and father and for the Apple employees who have lost a great leader, visionary and mentor. We, like millions of others worldwide, owe much of our success, joy and ease of life to the remarkable products and concepts that have sprung from Steve’s brilliant mind. The world has lost the most innovative and creative individual of the 20th and 21st centuries.   With our deepest sympathies,&nbsp; 
I have always enjoyed Steve's products from the Apple IIe's I used in high school to the MacIntosh's I used and supported at work. You have always provided innovate products for us to enjoy.  With the recent release of the iPhone 4S - I hope that it comes to symbolize and stand for "iPhone 4Steve" as a cult status way of remembering and honoring him. 
Steve has inspired me to be a better public speaker, pay attention to  the little details that make for a big difference in the pursuit of the  perfect user experience, and enjoy the tactile simplicity that brings  the joy of high technology to the wider community.  So many industries have been massively impacted by his style, vision,  and drive - he's created unstoppable momentum that's redefining so many  aspects of daily life.  Steve, you've created an excited generation of developers, UI designers,  and professionals in so many industries - I'm only sorry you didn't have  the opportunity to relax a while and enjoy the fruit of your incredible  efforts.
The world lost a amazing man, and will be less colored tomorrow.  A sad day for humanity.  My condolences.
I have only begun to appreciate his vision. As I type this on my iPad and eagerly await my first iPhone next Friday I think about what an innovative a nd inspiring person he was. He has left behind a legacy, a legacy that will  only continue to flourish and be leader of such innovative and "game changing" products as the iPad. Godspeed to Apple and rest in peace Mr. Jobs.
The world has lost an amazing human being. May you rest in peace Steve Jobs :(. And may your legacy live on. 
I am a fairly new customer to Apple. At least in the aspect of the  Macintosh operating system. I am sorry for your loss; but not just your  loss but mine as well. Steve had a great way of running things which  created this amazing operating system i fell in love with. Please don't  destroy what Steve spent his life building. I trust he left Apple in  good hands and i want you to do it like Steve would. Thank you.&nbsp;
Steve was a visionary that brought change to every aspect of technology that he touched. While I'm not a big Apple fan I can recognize the impact he had on the industry and the change he brought. Innovators like Steve are far and few between and he will be missed! RIP Steve!
Thank you Steve Jobs. You made the world better. You Inspire Us.
Steve Jobs, his vision and the products that sprung from that vision, was the catalyst for my career. My thoughts go out to his wife and children for their loss. For even though he changed the world for billions, to them he was husband and father. God Bless. 
 Sending love and thoughts to Mr. Jobs family and friends. Many blessings to a ll of them. Something to think about he passed away during the peak of Apple  season for those of us who harvest...
You will forever be missed, and your vision has changed the world. Your name will be known as long as Apple lives. RIP Steve Jobs. 
Steve jobs was/is my hero he is the one that got me into what is my life and what I hope to be my career. Technology. So I will always remember Steve Jobs as my hero.  Rip Steve Jobs&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve.  Thank you for changing our world for the better. 
As a fan of technology, I always saw Steve Jobs as a pure visionary, and the guy who defeated all the naysayers. He brought technology to a whole new level. I also think that Apple is, quite frankly, one of the most awesome companies out there. So when I heard that Mr. Jobs had passed away, I was shocked beyond belief. However, I have hope that Apple will still create fantastic technology that will further astound people with its ingenuity. I give my best wishes to Mr. Job's family and friends, and I wish them all the best in this time. May Mr. Jobs rest in peace.&nbsp;
He was an extraordinary human being and an extraordinary leader in Mexico, a lot of people that didn't know anything about computers knew what kind of a leader he was. Although I didn't know him, he was my hero because he always had a vision of the future. Thank you Steve... 
I feel like I lost a friend
So much to say! Steve is a visionary who has greatly influenced my life.  I was first introduced to computers via the Apple II. My first computer  that my parents bought us was an Apple II gs. I am currently writing  this on my MacBook. My iPhone and iPod are integral parts of my life. He  gave us an amazing vision of the future. In truth he brought the future  to us today via technology, design, and innovation. The world is a bit  darker without Steve. However, he has left us a vision of the future,  and the means to achieve it. That means is his wisdom, and our hearts. I  will never forget Steve Jobs, and all he has done in my life!!&nbsp;
Thank you for all you've done to help better our society. Ever since the iPhone came out, it's the only phone I've had. Every piece of technology I have  is made by Apple. You've touched the lives of many and I am grateful. Thank you and may you rest in peace.
 Thank you Steve Jobs, you made the world a better place. You will be missed :(              
I am only 16 years old, and just recently (past two years) got really into Apple products. I like watching the Special Apple keynotes on the new products that Apple releases, and Steve Jobs just made it what it is.&nbsp;Now, watching the new keynote with the introduction of the iPhone 4s, it’s just not the same. Mr. Cook did a great job with leading the way with the keynote, but it isn’t the same feeling as when Steve Jobs did it. It’s a part of Apple that will have to live in our memories (and YouTube). RIP Steve Jobs, My thoughts and prayers are with his family.
He was such an inspiring person. I couldn't believe how much can a man do to the world. The whole world has changed by Steve Jobs and that kind of things you won't forget ever.  Rest in peace, my hero!&nbsp;
an inspiration, in the truest sense of the word. 
Steve,  I appreciate all you have done for the world of computing. Personally,  you gave me the tools I needed to be successful as a freelance graphic  artist.  Your inspiration will be truly missed.  Thank you Steve.
Thank you Steve Jobs for bringing the future into the palm of our hands! RIP! &nbsp;
He will be remembered forever. Each time that a switch on my iPad or iPhone Steve will be there.     My condolences to his family and friends.
My life would be entirely different if it had not been for your creations. And although I have not had the pleasure of meeting you in person, I will miss you.  Thank you Steve.
deep condolences to Steve's family. Steve has had a huge impact on a lot of people's lives and he will be greatly missed. 
For me, Steve Jobs wasn't a hero or an idol.  He was the man that made my dreams come true.  From when I was a little boy and got my first word processor, learned to program in BASIC, I dreamed of portable computers.  Tiny little laptops, tablet computers...  I won't lie, I never could have dreamed of the iphone, but when it first came out, that's what it felt like.  Like science fiction had been made real.  I feel like someone just told me that Santa Claus isn't real.  Like there's no more magic in the world.  Apple will continue to develop and release wonderful products.  I just don't know if they, or anything else, will ever capture our imagination again the way Steve was able to. 
Today is a sad day and the amazing part is that this sadness that i feel  is for an individual that i never met, yet he truly defined my  generation and life as we know it.  He will be missed!! 
The world has lost one of its greatest genius. May Steve rest in peace  an may his work last for eternity. We will miss you and never forget. 
So sorry for all of you at Apple who worked with this man.  Don't let  his spirit of innovation die. He made my life easier, and a whole lot more fun. RIP, Steve Jobs. 
the world wont be the same with steve gone, he made the iphone and other apple products come to life and make a difference, may his heart be forever blessed and may his name always be remembered, sleep tight mr. jobs the angels are looking after you now
As I sit here surrounded by my Apple products I am saddened beyond description by the great loss of Steve Jobs.  My life has been greatly enhanced by the many years of innovative products that have always been years beyond their  time.  Apple has always been more than just another pc company. My Apple products are a part of my daily life and I would never want to be without them. This is the legacy that Steve left, the emotional connection between man and computer. There will never be another Steve Jobs and I send my deepest sympathy to his family, friends and the wonderful employees of Apple.&nbsp;
Steve will not be remembered 50 years from now because of the iPhone or the iPod, but because he never ceased to innovate beyond what was believed to be a finished product. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Can't believe that he gone. I loose my mine when i saw the picture of Steve.  The world has lost a genius and a hero of technology!
You are the great man ever ever. I will always miss you!&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to the Jobs family for the lost of a great and visionary man! I, my family, and the world will miss him for generations!  The humanity will thank you always for all that creativity and innovation legacy!  Thank you again Steve Jobs, rest in peace!
What an amazing person. I am so sorry for his family both at home and  work. He was so young. What a loss to the world.&nbsp;
You have made a huge impact on the world of technology and you will   never be forgotten. My deepest sympathy and prayers to the Jobs   Family. As I write this on my Macbook I am greatly appreciative to the   wonderful mind of Steve Jobs.  Thanks for making an impact on my life and the lives of many others   with the technology you have introduced to us over the years.  A loyal Apple Fan, and owner of many Apple products and many more in   the future.
I have been using apple products for several years and those products  from the mind of Steve Jobs have revolutionized my life. Each new  product I have bought have made me more productive and kept me closer in  touch with the world around me. I just bought my new iPhone last  thursday and once it has caused a paradigm shift in the way I organize  my life. There few people that come into the world who have that kind of  effect on society Edison, Ford, and Einstein come to mind. Steve Jobs  will truly be remembered as one of the greats who made an indelible mark  on this world.  God Bless Steve and his family.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve, for your contributions to this world and may you continue to flourish in the next.  My condolences to the Jobs family and Apple.
This quote sums up Apple, and why I love your products.   “It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology alone is not enough. That it’s technology married with liberal arts, married with the humanities, that yields us the result that makes our hearts sing.”  Thank you, Steve.
Thank you Steve Jobs for your courage and your brilliance.&nbsp;
To the folks at Apple and his family I send my sincere condolences. I find it fitting that I write this on a device that probably evokes the true spirit of Apple as a company and Steve as a directive force.  I remember clearly back in 1984 when my father, who worked for IBM at the time brought home the first Macintosh computer. He told me never to divulge the fact that he owned this machine. I remember that whenever he bought a personal computer it was always an Apple.  Many years later I purchased for my company an iMac G5 and needed to add memory. This required me to remove the back of the machine. I marveled at how elegantly this simple process worked. Upon opening the machine I was amazed to find that the interior of this device was as detailed and sculpted as the beautiful exterior. This attention to detail, in an area which most users would never see, electrified my imagination. Here was a Company that was committed to every aspect of design no matter how small.  This kind of focus does not happen by accident. Steve and the Company he helped build, not once, but twice, is what it is today because of that focus. Nothing is left to chance. Elegance is not a term left for a Paris Fashion show. It is a simple, powerful way of thinking, of seeing the world as a stage to present the very best that can be done.  Steve has influenced my own small corner of the world. My creative company uses many of the same sets of values that I have learned from reading about Steve and Apple. Strive for excellence in everything you do. Look forward to what's around the corner. Enjoy the challenge of creating a great company. Never settle for second best. Never give up.  As the years have gone on I have found that I own many of the great devices that Apple has produced. None of which will I ever sell. It's not because I want to start my own Apple museum, but I see them as representing a little piece of Apple as a company and Steve as a person.  I send to Steve's family my most sincere and heartfelt condolences. I wish for Apple the most incredible future that a Company can hope for.&nbsp;
Thanks for everything, Steve. I've had an amazing almost 25+ year fun  run with the incredible products you brought to the world. Every day is  made a little brighter and easier using Apple gear.&nbsp;
  :'( You will be missed.            
My heart goes out to the family and I especially want the children to remember that their Dad changed lives. The computer designs and innovations really delighted me and opened a world of information to my family. It really changed all of us. Our best wishes at this time of saddness. 
 Thank you Steve...rest in peace..
Dear Steve Jobs family  Although I did not know Steve personally he has changed things I do on a daily basis. He has given my son a chance to be part of an incredible company.  I am so proud that he is a part of the apple. It is not only a company it is truly a family.  May I send my personal condolences and may Steve rest in peace.&nbsp;
Only in the past 3 years I started to undurstand how far Steve as changed my  life and the lives of everyone far beyond the IT world. He did not simply drive the creation if new tools he opened new doors for all to explore, learn  and expand... and now he is gone!?!? Unacceptable! My humble and sincere condolences to friends and family we have lost a great  man indeed!&nbsp;
Steve really did impact lives. He impacted mine. Thanks, Steve. Your vision is a light that will not soon be dimmed. Rest in peace. 
My deepest thoughts go to his wife, children and close friends.   All I can offer are my modest, but most sincere condolences.   God bless you, Steve, and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Today the world lost a visionary, a man who worked hard to make the world a more fun place. He built a cult of die-hard fans who will NEVER give up their Apple computers. I thank him for that, my wife thanks him for that, and my kids thank him for that. Steve Jobs was one of a kind, a genius and a hero to people everywhere. RIP Steve, you will be greatly missed as we all loved you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will be remembered for the many imprints of genius and  insight he left in this world.  My condolences to his family and all of  the people at Apple who work tirelessly to provide the best consumer  products for technology today.  May his legacy live on in the company.  May we always remember his  vision and willingness to push the envelope.  May his family forever  remember how his legacy has left the world a better place.  Thank you.
Steve Jobs,  You have inspired me to be Innovative and be Ingenious.  You also have made me realized that people would see a person who crazy in the beginning, but in the long run, that person will be a great impression on society. This has been proven throughout history with Albert Einstein and many other. And you are in the league of Geniuses.  Thank you for connecting the world. Thank you for sharing the inspirations. Thank you for making me believe in myself. Thank you Sir.  May you Rest In Peace. My condolences goes to your family and Apple. May you be remembered as the iGod of the Tech World.
Dear Steve:  Ironically, earlier today, I was telling my Mom the importance of Apple in our lives, the importance to the (our) world though innovation, his vision, i n some many ways.... in the way we listen to music, the way we use the phone  (cellphones) iPhone, the meaning of a tablet "pc" the iPad, the superior qu ality of the Mac's. Just&nbsp; minutes before the sad news, I share with my Mom , in my new iPad, the video of "my new personal assistant.  Today I feel sad, it's an emptiness. Today we lost an extraordinary visionary.  Rest in peace, we always remember You though Apple, You change the way we li ve, You change the world, You change the taste of The Apple. 
I have always had a fascination with the ingenuity that Steve brought forth.  He was an amazing mix of charisma, leadership, and innovation that has made him quite possibly the greatest CEO of my generation if not ever.  His legacy will continue to live in the spirit of Apple 
Steve Jobs was a genius, a visionary, an icon, and my greatest  influence.  He makes our lives easier each and every day.  He will be  greatly missed.&nbsp;
   Steve will be with us for all time in the best of our human spirit. 
He was an enormous inspiration to me for decades, of what could be achieved with uncompromising vision.&nbsp;
I love art. I love physics. I applied to college today, and 12 months ago freaked out because I had no idea what to do with my life. Because of Steve Jobs and John Ives, I am going to Carnegie Mellon for industrial design. I want to thank them so much, more than can be expressed in an email.  ‎"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don’t settle."
I didn't know him but he seemed like a wonderful human being.  I can say I feel his creativity, or at least his vision for what Apple has created has made the world a more functional place.  I am sure he will be missed by all who worked with him.  My condolences to his family and friends.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You taught us a pleasure to create something which didn't exist in the world .20  I never forget you and products you created. Also, I challenge to change the  world using the power of electronics.  You are my hero. May your soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
TRISTE CON LA PARTIDA DE STEVE JOBS. EL LEGADO QUE DEJA ES INMENSO, GRACIAS A EL, LA VIDA ES MUCHO MÁS SIMPLE Y DIVERTIDA!!!  GRACIAS POR TODO STEVE JOBS!!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs, you were an inspirational person who changed the world. You could have retired to enjoy life on your own private island a long time ago, but you continued to pursue your passion until the end. Thank you for showing us how it's done.
Thank you Mr. Jobs for all you have given the world.  Your inventions, your words, your inspiration.  You will be missed.  Much peace to you and your loved ones.  xo.
Aloha Steve!  You were a part of my whole life.  From age 9, I was on an Apple II that my father brought home.  From those old days of green screen memories, and developing into a family that all uses Apples, I thank my father for introducing me to them, and Steve Jobs for never giving up!    We will always remember you and the gifts you have developed for the world to use!  May we use them well! &nbsp;
 Thanks Steve! You will be missed but your innovative spirit will live forever!  Thanks for  changing the world for the better.
   I just wanted you to have know that you were truly inspirational to me in so many ways other than technology. You were a revolutionary and pioneer and a marketing genius. Always a market leader an envied in the technology field. You were able to establish one of the best brands on the planet and you are a true rags to riches success story. You moved millions of people and inspired an entire generation to do better than what is already out there now.&nbsp;
So sorry to hear of Steve's passing. Truly a great man has left us but he has left us with alot.&nbsp;
 Think differently. Creative genius inspires. An Apple changed the world. Thank you, Mr. Jobs, for changing the world.
Steve Jobs is my idol.  His speech at Stanford inspired me much.  I wish Jobs rest in peace. 
I am writing my condolences on a Mac. I have been using a Mac since os9.  Never looked back. Thank You.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has affected all our lives in one way or another. I never knew him, I'm just a consumer, but I have hugely enjoyed Apple products since the '90s. Wow. What can we say about the impact this one man had on all of us. I am saddened but hope that he passed in peace and is existing in peace now.  Best Regards, Steve. We will all miss you.&nbsp;
Hello  I just wanted to write to say I have always admired Steve Jobs as one of the innovators of the 20th and 21st century. Apple has always been a company in touch with it's grass roots and pride in being able to deliver cutting edge products of excellent quality to the end user.  Thank you Steve for your decades of hard work and visions of the future office and home.  Deepest respect and gratitude 
We truly lost a visionary person that will never be replaced. Steve   you will be remembered for centuries to come. I am pretty sure that   God is going to ask you to invent an IPhone for those who live in   heaven. My deepest sympathy to the family and may God bless your soul.&nbsp;
This is to the greatest and most influential innovator and executive of  my generation.  Your brilliance will be forever seen and remembered by  the way you have revolutionized the tech industry. &nbsp;Mr. Jobs, you have changed the world for the better and we will forever  remember you.  We have truly lost an extraordinary human.  God bless and we'll be seeing you in another life rocking out to your  iPod.&nbsp;
I bought one of your computers in the late 1970's and have been a hopeless computer junkie ever since.  I feel like I lost a member of my immediate family tonight.  As I type this on my iPad, I am truly saddened - emotional.  What a great contributor to all of our lives.  Steve will be missed.
Steve  was a great American.  A visionary that put people first... he  will be missed.&nbsp;
he was an amazing man in that he left a lot behind that can greatly improve society as a whole. 
 I learn with emotion the death of Steve Jobs I am deeply saddened and shocked to learn that my first thoughts are with family and friends I am wholeheartedly with them and would like to pay tribute to this great visionary Steve Jobs has been seen has its final presentation yesterday with the iphone 4s and I will end by saying thank you thank you very much for doing all dreamed and have allowed the development of innovative technologies never seen rest in peace ...    R.I.P&nbsp;

To apple,  Steve Jobs is a role model who my children revere in near-hero status. His vision and spirit will live forever.  He will be missed in the flesh but will  forever be a presence in our world.  May peace and happy reflection of Mr. Jobs be in all of us foreword.&nbsp;
To Steve's family and friends. I did not know this gentleman but he has changed my life with his visions. My sincerest condolences go out to you all.            Many Thanks
I just got my first computer at 38 yrs old last Halloween.  I wanted to  get a quality computer and always heard that Apple was the top of the  line.  After a year working with it,  I understand just what people  meant by it being the best.  I just want to say thanks because it is  opening up doors that I didn't know existed in the most positive ways.  Anything is possible is an understatement. 
You always have inspired me, all the time... You always be with me, in my soul and mind...  You always be eternal...i'm so sorry inside.&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs,  I have heard that you passed away some moments ago. I feel very sorry for that.  I want to tell you something that came to my mind just when I read the bad news: there's no end for those who set up a beginning. This is because it is that beginner behaviour what the World needs to go forward, not just economically and technologically speaking, but also in the human sense. I remember now something you once said: “Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me … Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful… that’s what matters to me." And certainly, you can rest forever with the fact that you left a legacy of something wonderful, a better way of thinking and being.
Steve inspired me. As someone who grew up using Macs, I was always keenly aware of the difference passion, humanism, and art make in any endeavor. He poured all of these into his products, and showed the world that success and human values go hand in hand.  He will always be my hero.&nbsp;
what an inspiration. so sad and he will be missed not forgotten.
A true genius. He will be dearly missed.  RIP Steve 1955-2011 
Hi Apple!  He will be surely missed here in the Philippines.  May he rest in peace. We will pray for his humble soul.  He is truly a great man with a great heart!  Thanks steve for inspiring us!  We love you!
Thank you for putting beauty in technology, for not giving up, for great products and great innovation.
We are truly saddened by Steve's death. He was a guide and a source of  constant inspiration for us. His revolutionary ideas and his spirit will  live forever.  Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
Toute mes condoléances, c'est vraiment triste qu'il soit parti si vite, c'était un homme bien et un grand génie, MERCI POUR TOUT STEVE   my condolences to all who have known it was a good man, it's really sad   Thank you for you Steve.  
Dear Apple, It is very sad to know that such a genius had left us. He has always been my  hero, my role model. His words have always been inspiring. 'Stay hungry, stay foolish' has become my motto in life, get me to reflect and be true to my self. Even though he can no longer be with us, he had lived a legend and the whole  world is lamenting. I really hope Apple could carry on his passion, and do the best that you can to carve out another legend just like him, for he had already built a foundation for you to get going. Wish you all the best and stay tough! I am an Apple fan and will stay tune on your products.
thank you steve for helping make my childhood and teen years full of  incredible experiences. rest in piece, the einstien of my generation  
Your time was well spent.  And your passion touched my heart as you made the world a better place. 
Steve your vision and passion will be greatly missed.   Thanks for the inspiration&nbsp;
Dear Steve, Thank you very much.  You had made our life become so magical.
Steve, Thank you for all of your gifts.  You changed the world in so many   ways.  You're the last of the great explorers... My heart and prayers go out to your family.&nbsp;
So sad to hear about Mr. Jobs.&nbsp; I had my first Apple II when I was 13.&nbsp; Absolutely loved it.&nbsp; Was a fan of Apple and Mr. Jobs ever since. He will be missed.
Because of the lifetime's work of Steve Jobs, I have been enabled to  achieve the goals that I dream of. What Steve achieved during his  lifetime is something that has truly never been done before. Simply put,  he made the world a better place.&nbsp;
Hi,  My name is Issi. Im from Sydney, Australia.  I know how distant we are from each other but yet we feel so close at  this time of mourning.  The world has lost an incredible man, so inspirational and modest.  The way he changed peoples lives, not only though technology, but  through sheer eccentricity and the radicalism of today world.  To the Jobs family, do not be shamed, Steve was an amazing man who  accomplished so much. he lived his life to the full, and God decided  that his work was done on earth. He was an angel, but not ours to keep.  My thoughts go out to all mourners.
just impossible to imagine a world without his great mind, RIP steve... your life will inspire everyone of us. Thank you.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve. I'll never forget you. 
Steve created products that were so transcending that it literally created fodder for endless hours of communication between my son and I.  Thank you Steve for giving me something that I will always cherish and something that I know you valued-family time.  RIP&nbsp;
My heart goes out to everyone at Apple and in the Apple community. This is a  sad day, I owe much of my livelihood to Steve and his great company. Thank you all for you have given us.&nbsp;
When we were all sort of comfortable with our life, he said it's not good enough.
Steve Jobs not only gave us a quantum leap in technology, but he has also shown us how to do it humanly! He has taught us that all this technological era is meaningless if you can't be in touch with people you love, your family and yourself. For that, he shall be forever missed.  Your dreams will stay built into your hearts.&nbsp;
Although I never knew him, my heart is truly saddened that the world has  lost such a brilliant visionary!!  My deepest condolences to all who  knew and loved him.  May happy memories get them through this tough  time.  God Bless You Steve Jobs!!&nbsp;
I remember the day I got my first computer, an Apple IIci, and as a designer I have never used anything but Apple since. The world has lost an amazing visionary and creative genius. You have inspired so many people Steve, and you will be definitely missed. My heart goes out to your family and friends.
  Hello,  I would like to send my deepest regret to Steve´s family on this tragic day.  I admire Steve Jobs and you gotta give the dude credit for transforming a simple, yet creative idea into a global success. R.I.P
You have been a "Great Man"... R.I.P Steve Jobs.   
Three apples changed the course of the world:  Adam and Eve's forbidden apple... Newton's apple...  and finally... Steve Jobs' Apple  A sad, sad day for the world. I regret not having the chance to meet him in person, but I will always be grateful for everything he has done to change the way we live our lives.  You will be missed Steve...
Thanks Steve for everything.   Been a big fan for years and from the beginning. Love your work and what values you have built the company to today.  We will never forget your innovative genius and your spirit will live on.  RIP Steve.
 It feels like my favorite uncle just passed. I am deeply saddened. I'm happy I got to see him give a keynote in person. Rest in peace, Steve. You will surely be missed.&nbsp;
As a person who has very limited understanding of technology, I want to say how much I have appreciated the tools that Steve Jobs introduced into the world.  I love my iMac.  I love my iPhone.  I love my iPod.  I love my new Apple TV.  Some day I hope to say I love my iPad!  I love knowing that when I don't understand why one of those wonderful tools isn't working, there are people on-line, or in stores, or reachable by phone who love these products and understand how to set me back on the path and are patient with my lack of understanding.  And so I say thank you to Steve Jobs.  Here's hoping that Apple can carry on with the innovation and care.    My condolences to the family, friends and co-workers.
"Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is  to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.  If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking, and don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart,  you’ll know when you find it."    Obrigado Steve!&nbsp;
I met him once in a cafe. Honestly the nicest and smartest man I ever   met to the day. He offered to show me the best thing on the menu. To   this day I still go there and only get that. I love you Mr Jobs,  Farewell.
He lived life. He achieveid whatever he wanted to, by hard work, skill and enthusiasm. He loved his work, his field, his responsibility. I hope he told his family all they needed to know, all he wanted them   to know. He connected my dots. I hope, and think, he connected his own.  His ideas and passion will far outlive him.
As a dedicated advocate of Apple products since 1986, I'm saddened at  hearing of Steve's death. The only words that come to me at this time  are, Thank you, Steve. Thank you. 
Thank you, Steve, for all that you have done for the technology community around the world.  You will be forever missed and remembered for years to come and will live on in the very devices that you helped bring to life...&nbsp;
I am SO sorry to hear this.   He was an amazing and very inspiring   person and will be greatly missed.  Bon Voyage. 
Steve, thanks for believe in dreams. Thank for make us feel that other  world is possible. You broke many walls, you built many bridges between  people,  you made smaller the oceans and bigger our thoughts and hearts.  But the most important. You were you. Nobody else. Not sad because you left but happy because you were. We are all proud of you.  
The first computer I ever laid hands on was an Apple II.  The first  computer program I ever wrote was on an Apple IIe.  While I never had  the pleasure of knowing Steve, he certainly had an effect on my life  through his vision and ingenuity.  I am truly saddened by the news of  Steve's passing and send my sincerest condolences to Steve's family and  friends.  Today the world has lost one of the most amazing minds it has  ever known.
 From our family to yours, our deepest condolences. He will be missed; yet, his genius will live on forever.
My deepest sympathy and sorrow for the loss of a great person and creator.  May he rest in peace.
Es una enorme perdida mundial gracias a Steve me inspiro en muchos aspectos de mi vida! Te recordaremos siempre.
Dear Steve,  it was a pleasure having you in this world, we will always remember you and  take you in our, hearts and Mac's.  God bless you and your family.  Take care and see you in the next world.&nbsp;
As I write this on my MacBook Pro, I can't help but think of how a sad day today is.  He was definitely a great innovator and visionary, who still had such a bright future ahead of him.  No one will ever be able to duplicate his visions.  My condolences to his family and loved ones.
His touch is in everything I touch... my personal computer, the computer  in my classroom, and in the computers my students use in the computer  lab at school.  I watch Pixar movies, I use an iphone, and plan to buy an ipad.  Apple friendly user products enchanced my  life, made me feel smart,  made made me feel "cool", because they were  so-o-o-o-o cool.  If there is a heaven, I'm sure he's already focused on making things  better there too!  I believe his is a spirit that will live forever.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs 1955-2011   Candle in your memory.  Rest in peace, god bless you.     Thank you.  
From a apple fan, god bless you and your family. You will be missed!&nbsp;
Somehow it felt like Steve was bigger than life and would go on inventing and inspiring forever...Heaven will be a better place with Steve Jobs to innovate and improve that experience. 
Steve was an amazing human being, and did so much for mankind, everyone should shut down their products for 60 seconds in honor of him.  The whole world would go dark.  I built my entire career using products he designed.  He will truly be missed, but his legacy will live on forever.  Thank you.  God Bless&nbsp;
He was a great man i loved all of his products i truly respected him and looked up to him for his intellegence with technology. i am saddened by this news. R.I.P. Steve Jobs Forever Will Be Missed.
It took a great man to create the company you created and to see a nation lose an innovator as yourself is deeply disturbing. Although there is some out there who has watched your rise and is sitting at home thinking of new ways to change the world as you did, today is a day we could compare to the lost of the many icons we have had to say good-bye to. The world mourns as we all sit back thinking how strong you must have been. A friend of mines spoke on how you planted a seed in the world of technology and how fitting was it for you to call your company Apple. It's the little things that make impacts on the greatest people. You were great, you will be missed, you will forever be remembered as one of the greatest innovators of our time. God bless you and your family.
Our heartfelt condolences to the Family and friends of Steve Jobs on his passing today!&nbsp; He was a great inventor, technology guru, scholar, family man, humanitarian, and American icon!&nbsp; He will truly be missed by the millions of people who knew about his products he created.&nbsp; God Bless his soul and let us all remember the many lessons and goodwill he taught all of us! I for one will always cherish his ingenuity and dedication to his company.&nbsp;
I am sorry for the passing of the greatest genius of technology! Apple II was my world growing up but then lost touch and became an MS freak still miss the way i used to hacked the Apple dos computer. he will be missed.
Words cannot express the sadness I feel at the loss of such a wonderful human  being. Thank you Steve Jobs for making our world a better place, for inspiring many young minds, for your innovation, for making our present and future a place of technological wonder. Your vision will outlive us all.
You even made Unix look beautiful 
Words cannot explain our grief and disbelief towards your passing, Steve. You amazed us with the brilliance of your ideas. Thank you for changing the world. &nbsp;
I just wanted to convey to all of Steve Job's family, friends, Apple and all who knew him my condolences. He really did change the world in a great way. I thank him for all the wonderful things he has brought to me in my life and my friend's lives that make it a better, happier place to be. He will be missed.
The Walt Disney of my generation is gone.  I will forever be marked by his genius, innovation, creative and spirit.  Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.
Thank you for serving as an example and keep us believing that we can make a better world. Go in peace! 
Thank you for turning a vision of the future, into the future.  Thank you for taking a stand, and making a difference. God speed to your family, and to your legacy - great things are to come from your inspiration.&nbsp;
Steve is the guy that saw the vision and worked like mad to make it happen. He had the "taste"  that the world wanted to savor. I will truly miss his continuing influence of how I consume my media and have fun. My best to his personal and business family.&nbsp;
 Hello    He was a great man.   Its very sad.&nbsp;
God bless, you, Steve. You have changed the world &lt;3 
My life overflowed with the very creative ways of thinking by having met with the product of the apple company.  If it is a Heaven wall beam after I die, I would like to consider conversation as you very much.  Mr. Steve Jobs, I send much gratitude and respect to you.  I wish you get peaceful rest.
i am saddened by this lost. May his soul rest in peace. 
He was a visionary, a genius and in so many ways he did change the world. He will be missed.
Dear Apple,  I remember the first time my dad bought me an Apple Ipod.&nbsp; I think it was the 2nd generation with the click wheel and the four buttons on top.&nbsp; i was really amazed and thought whoever invented such.&nbsp; I admire the man who provided the world with so much ease and comfort with technology.&nbsp; I never thought that being a "techie" would be so cool.&nbsp; Steve Jobs made the world love technology and learn from it even more.  We will forever be grateful for sharing his inventions.&nbsp; I know it's impossible but I hope that there will be another Steve Jobs to further more impossible inventions.  Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
 STEVE JOBS...thank you very much!You have revolutionized not only the computer era, you showed the whole  world how important it is to "think different".&nbsp;Rest in Peace
I will remember Steve Jobs as a visionary and personal inspiration by challenging conventional wisdom of personal computing and what humans can achieve.  You will be missed Steve. May God keep and lend comfort to your family.&nbsp; 
My heart goes out to Steve's family, and friends, and I pray that his  life will serve as an example to the world of what one man can do with a  vision, and the determination to see that vision come to fruition.  He  leaves this world a better place than it was when he got  here, because  of his positive contribution to mankind.  I hope to see you on the other  side Steve. 
Im so sad right now, I love Apple and I love Steve. &nbsp;Hope he has it good in heaven
Not sure who reads these anyway...  But I've been trying to imagine what apple could do to honor Steve.  A statue isn't enough.  Besides, it's kinda cheesy.  But something giant, inscribed with every single email in this inbox... (cen sored for inappropriate content of course) would maybe, perhaps, almost be enough.&nbsp;
I grew up with Apple. My dad had a Macintosh color classic that he liked  to take a part and put back together. When we got our first iMac, my  brother and I used to giggle when we wrote ridiculous passages and  played them back in SimpleText. I wrote all my papers in ClarisWorks.  My parents bought me an iPod when I got into college, and my dad sent  Steve an e-mail about adding video to the iPod before the launch of the  video enabled iPod.  Apple and Steve had a huge impact on my life and my memories. Steve will  be missed.
You never gived up... You changed the world for ever... You changed how people listen to music How people communicate with each other... How we watch movies, read books or  play games iThink you made world a better place Steve... You changed everything...
Sadden by his passing...&nbsp; I didnt know him personnally, but love what he has created... Prayers and thoughts for His Family and coworkers...!!! Stay Strong and Positive...&nbsp; 
I just saw the news on the internet this morning and still cannot believe that he is gone now.   I have been using ipod, iphone and mac laptop for several years now and really love them. When I had difficult times studying aboard the music made me cheer up and that was because of the ipod...   Always admired his job.. Hope he'd be in a peace and I will always remember him...
thank you for creating Apple. Whole world enjoyed with your lovely ideas. We all hope that you have peace in heaven. Thank you.
Our thanks to Steve Jobs for providing a vision for technology that will help many children with special needs learn and communicate.
God bless, Steve Jobs,   The immensity of his impact on our life style will go down in history.  He was as important as the Industrial Revolution of the late 1800s.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, children, and family.
I bought my first computer an apple II..."they're friendly" I remember the  saleswoman saying...it was so much fun and helped me in my job...I've had  macs ever since, ipods, minimac and macbook. &nbsp;what a loss to the world...so sad.
Steve Jobs was an inspiration and the reason that we have a technical age of  innovation and wonder at our fingertips. His decision to delay development of the iPad and to concentrate on the iPhone was a stroke of genius very few would have made. The world was better off having known Steve and we will miss  him. May Allah have mercy on his soul.&nbsp;
Steve,  You were the best of the best! We were stronger with you than without  you and you will be sorely missed May God bless you always
Steve Jobs was one of the leaders that I follow, the lessons of life my job as a manager, I follow your lessons. Thank you. Heavenly Father enlighten you.&nbsp;
Dear Apple Team,  Don't forget Steve, He, from anywhere, will stay helping you, somehow. My english skill is very low, but everything gonna be alright, not  exactly as it was, but, alright.
I'd like to express my most sincere condolences to Apple's founder, Mr. Steve Jobs' family and friends.  I will carry his memory into the future with the fruits of his labor in hand.&nbsp;
Steve,  Your memory will last forever. You changed the world, make it a  better,  friendly, closer warmer place . Now you left us  and   you will be in  the place you deserve: heaven. We will never forget you. Thanks for all.  Rest in Peace dear friend&nbsp;
Steve thank you for what you had given us, you taught us how consistence planing needs time, then little idea could change the world. You will be missed, and always be alive in the art you created, &amp; engineering work you performed. Such a Great mind
I first met Steve while I was working at Sperry managing our business relationship with Pixar.  I had never met anyone like him before and never anyone like him since.  During our meetings it was clear he was focused on making Pixar a success, driven to make it happen and encouraging - assuming you were on the right track!  I am thankful to have met Steve and have always appreciated the creativity he has shown us all through the Pixar movies and innovative Apple products.  We have lost a lost a true technology visionary.  My thoughts and prayers for his family tonight.&nbsp;
Steve. *Thank you for everything, you will always be in our hearts.*
Thank you for believing that "the rest of us" mattered. You have changed our  world immeasurably, and all for the better.
Steve inspired me. As someone who grew up using Macs, I was always keenly aware of the difference passion, humanism, and art make in any endeavor. He poured all of these into his products, and showed the world that success and human values go hand in hand.  He will always be my hero.
iSad but, I will stay hungry and stay foolish. Thank you Steve!
Love You Steve.  My condolences to the Jobs family.&nbsp;
A simple visionary like Galileo, Columbus, DaVinci, and Lennon.  Never  stopped dreaming of what could be. 
Thank you for everything Steve. Thank you with much love. 
Steve  Thank you for inspiring us to be more!  Take care and rest in peace 
The saddest news of today, very deep condolences... You're inspiring... you're innovator... you're motivator.... You're SO AMAZING....!! Goodbye Mr Jobs... I'll missed you, Rest in Peace...
I am glad that i am using a part of what you have created. To the family  please accept my deepest sympathy on behalf of my family.&nbsp;
No word can explain the loss of Mr. Jobs.  We wish only the best for his family and hope Apple will continue to always remember and aspire to Mr. Jobs's vision.  Forever a man who has changed my world and a world for my children.&nbsp;
i thank you for your innovation. no the world thanks you for your innovation. goodbye Mr Jobs 
Tks God for Jobs, tks Jobs for my iPhone &amp; iPad. &nbsp;
As the massive geek that I am it is truly sad to see that Steve jobs has passed away at just 56 after years of ill health. As a businessman he has always inspired me, as an innovator he changed the tech world forever and as a human being he amazed everybody with his genius ... R.I.P you will be incredibly missed. Steve Jobs a true mastermind.&nbsp;
One of the most creative minds have been lost. May his thoughts and ambitions and visions of the future forever live.
I'm sadden to hear that we've lost a brilliant mind in this world. I pass  my condolences to his family and dear friends, a great loss with such a  brilliant mind.
I'm sorry to hear about the recent tragedy, even though I wasn't a huge fan of Apple, I still understand what Steve Jobs did and how it shaped the technology we're given today. &nbsp;And I respect him for that. &nbsp;He will always be remembered in my heart as a mastermind and a genius in the technology world. I hope when I grow older I wish I could even achieve a percentage of what he has accomplished.  With love and sympathy. 
You have changed the world as well as how I live and do things. Thank you. My thoughts and prayers are with the family.&nbsp;
Once in a generation, once in a century, one human being makes a  difference that affects our civilization and resonates into our future.  Mr. Jobs has done that with his life and vision.  God Bless You, and Thank You...  
I saw Steve speak one time, in Cambridge Massachusetts at a tech convention in the late 1980's.  Steve was showing his latest NeXt computer.  Here he was, in front of the East Coast techies, who thought well of themselves.  He was all alone with a couple of slides and that iconic NeXt cube computer that had no mouse, keyboard, screen, nothing.  Just a cube.  He gave his opening, then went into Q&amp;A.  He won over each questioner one-by-one, and the audience.  Not only was he convinced that the NeXt was superior in every way, but everyone in that audience knew it too.  I will never forget that moment.  Thank you Steve. 
     I am a college student from China       I love advisements and media,and my specialized subject is computer and information      Mr.Jobs means a idol to me ,a leader,a legend      The world need Jobs,maybe God needs Jobs ,too      Mr.Jobs,you have got away,but the enterprising spirit and creative mind will never die       Wish you happy in heaven,from my heart.             
Steve Jobs was know as the man who recreated the way we look at, and use technology today. He showed us that an idea, hard work, and dedication go a long way.  He will never be forgotten. R.I.P. 
Thank you Steve not only for what you did for this world but personally for me.  I began using Apple computers in graduate school and continued today in my consulting business.  I have been poked fun and not considered a serious business person due to use of MacBooks in my business.  I guess I got the last laugh as I repeatedly told all that you can have wintels and apple is and will always be my computing source.  God bless Steve Job and thank you for being such an influence in my life.  May Steve's legacy ALWAYS be retained in every product designed &amp; produced by Apple.  Steve Jobs is and always will be Apple. 
When I was 15 I had a friend with an Apple IIe. I was blown away.....and jealous.  It was years before I could actually afford an Apple product but once  I was able to, I have continued purchasing just about every product Apple makes. Apple has just made my life "better" in so many ways and I thank Steve  Jobs for that. Thank you Steve. We will miss you. 
Sadly I don't even remember the year, but I was in DC for a computer networking symposium near L'Enfant Plaza. One evening's function was courtesy of Steve - he had rented the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum for our group to introduce/ show his Next computer. Amid strolling musicians, Irish coffee, and petit fours, I got to meet Steve, shake his hand and listen to him talk abou the Next.   H Ross Perot was there, introduced by Steve, and his son talked about his recent military rescue mission.   I'm happy I got to personally meet Steve, way back when. I am sad.
Thanks for being here and changing world.  We all will miss you forever.     May he rest in peace.
May you rest in peace knowing how you have changed so many people's  lives.  God Bless the Jobs Family. 
I never thought this would be so hard, I feel like losing someone really close to me, I wish all the best for  the Jobs family, the Apple team and all of the people whom Steve  inspired and accompanied.&nbsp;
I would like to share my condolences to Steve's family, friends and colleagues. I am deeply saddened that the world has lost a creative genius and visionary. As I am studying to become an Industrial Designer, I appreciate and admire the work Steve has committed throughout the years that has changed and shaped the industry today. He was a true inspiration and always will be.
Steve Jobs is really a genius in this time, everyone will miss him  worldwide. This man is going to live in the memory of this generation and for  generations. I'm from a far away country and had never seen Steve Jobs in my whole  life, yet he will always stay in my memory and always be the grand man.
Thank you Steve for all your hard work, you will be missed.     
 Your inspiration will guide future generations fro decades to come.
A better world because of you.
 WE WILL MISS YOU..  genius!&nbsp;
 What an amazing human being. When I was 15, i received my first apple computer in 1984 and have not stopped to marvel at his genius, and have loved the culture of Mac that Steve built. Though I only met him once, he was one of the few people that I looked up too, and visioned of working at Apple ever since.    Let his legacy be that he has developed not only a company that builds technology equipment but of creating the culture of Mac that so many have joined and relished over the last 30 years….A way of life for millions of people that the rest of the world only now is beginning to understand.    God bless you Steve and may you live forever in our hearts&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has honestly influenced my life so much. I'm proud to say I'm  emailing this message right now on my Macbook Pro, with my iTouch, iPod  Nano, and Macbook are close by. It took one man to change technology  forever. He made such an impact on every customer, always with pleasing  products. I remember how upset I was after hearing he had resigned from  his position, only to find out months later, he had passed away. He was  a great man with a talent and passion for technology like no other.&nbsp;
Do not write in English very well, but I did my best to express the void in the world will have after the death of this genius The world lost an incredible person, a genius that mankind will miss. Jobs made a progress in 56 years something that mankind will take at least 100 years to execute the same. His death will leave a void in the world and the feeling that we lost a genius. my condolences&nbsp;
i love what you did in this world and what you came up. This is a very  sad day. my prayers go out to his family and close friends RIP Steve  Jobs.
This is indeed a very sad day that words cannot describe. I can't hardly  think of any single person in modern day who has done more to improve  and enrich the lives of our fellow Americans and people the world over  than Mr. Jobs. What a tremendous loss to mankind. I am grieving for us  all.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Rest in peace wherever you are!! Thanks for your clear mind, bright ideas which have innovate our world.  Making it easier and happy.&nbsp;
Steve was such an incredible inspiration for me and so many others. He made me feel okay and excited about following my heart. His contributions will not be forgotten. My thoughts are with his family and friends. He was was an exceptional man and will be dearly missed.             
 He inspired us on a single way in each one's lives. Thanks Apple, Thanks Steve.
My sincerest condolences to all family at this time of sorrow.  You was one of a kind, changed the lives of millions &amp; will be missed.   God Bless
Today is one of the saddest day of my life. you can't imagine how many  time I said " I love you Steve jobs" every time i use my iPhone , my mac  book, my iPad and see how brilliant it operate I used to say " I love  you steve jobs"  It's a sad day. I don't know what to say  ... 
Thanks what you have given to the world. While your life was short, you are true example of the quality of life not the quantity of life.
I don't have too many words for Steve, because maybe already everything has been said, but we should remember him as the leader he was, with all the innovations his mind created. He was somebody who loved going beyond expectations, and most of all he was a real GENIUS.&nbsp;
All I can say is thank you for my first computer... my favorite lap top  and my favorite phone. Steve Jobs will never be forgotten.
You were  such a great man, you allowed me to touch a piece of  technology, and I think the world is saying the same. 
Steve, you are an example for anybody who wants to do whatever in the  best way. Thank you to show me the way to get it.  I never forget you Steve&nbsp;
I don't know if I am a geek or I just play too much with my  toys. I really love all that you have brought to the world. I am really crying because I will miss your great Keynotes. You changes  the world and there will be know one like you again.
Steve Jobs' passing is a great loss for all of us in the technology world. 
Thank you Steve for changing the world.&nbsp; You will truly be missed.&nbsp; May you rest in peace. 
God bless Steve and his family.  To his Apple family, we are sorry for your loss as well.  
 Just home from work, wake up my iMac, and the news of Steve's death  greets me on the New York Times main page.  Flip on MSNBC and the tributes are already running.  I am stunned and  greatly saddened.  It feels like a death in the family.  What an incomparable person he was. What a life he had. &nbsp;What a  legacy he leaves!
Hello, I've recently become part of the Apple team. I'd like to take this opportunity to celebrate a person with whom I would have enjoyed having a conversation.&nbsp;
Just to say that even though I've never personally met Steve, every time I heard him speak, it felt personal. My thoughts and prayers are with the entiree Jobs family, and in 200 years, when people speak of personal computing, he  will most certainly be remembered as one of the forefathers.  He will most certainly be missed.
Dear Steve,  I regret for not sending an email to you earlier (and see whether I could get a reply). But thank you for being an inspiration source to everyone of us till the last minute of your life and beyond.
Thanks Steve Jobs for bringing some brilliance into our lives.  You will be missed.
My dad buying an Mac 128k and letting me run wild with it was probably one of the most influential events in my life. It taught me to read, it taught me math, and it kicked off a lifelong passion for computers and programming. It's amazing to me that he and Apple designed a computer that I didn't even have to know how to read to interact with *in the 80's*.  I can't believe I'm getting so emotional about a person I've never met, but I'm tearing up. I guess I've sort of interacted with his personality in a lot of the products I've used, and I've always had that sense. I'll miss him, I hope I'll get to keep seeing a bit of him in Apple's stuff.&nbsp;
Thank you for sharing your gifts with all of the world Steve.  You will  remain in my heart as a trailblazer, a pioneer, a visionary, and one who  never gave up.  Rest in Peace Steve.  My sincere condolences to the Jobs  and Apple families.
To a great man,  I never met you but I feel like I know you. May your soul rest in peace. Adieu.
What can be said about Steve Jobs that his actions have not? He built a great company and pioneered the personal computer. After being fired he returned  to his company, only to make it the most valuable in the world. As I send this message from my iPhone, I am saddened. He was the last of a dying breed,  a great entrepreneur. His work has impacted nearly every person on the planet in one way or another. The world has lost a great inventor, spokesperson,  businessman, genius, human, and American. What Steve left behind can not be  put into words.
 Steve Jobs, Thank you for everything!!                
What a great person with amazing ideas. You will be missed Steve!&nbsp;
Thanks Steve. You have inspired many of us. We will miss you.&nbsp;
I am very sad to hear of Steve Job's demise. My condolences to his family. Hope Apple can continue to grow from strength to strength as it is the best way to thank Steve Job.    
Speechless. Shocking news this morning. May you rest in Peace, Mr Incredible.
Steve Jobs, I will always remember you like my hero. RIP. 
Thank you for bringing us technology that we experience, not simply use.&nbsp;
The world has truly lost an amazing man with a fantastic vision. He will be sorely missed. 
My name is Ben and I'm 8. &nbsp;Steve Jobs was   my hero like Derek Jeter. Steve Jobs helps the world and Derek Jeter   helps the pitcher when he's doing bad he calms the pitcher down when   he's stressed I think there is a similarity with these two amazing   people. Steve Jobs changed the world, he did things no one can do, and   every one's heart dropped when he was diagnosed with cancer. So the   point is Steve Jobs will be remembered for ever like Babe Ruth or   Thomas Jefferson. Now I hope Apple will invent and make thing like the   iphone 5,6,7,8,9 and so on.   
I wish to express my sadness for the loss of such a great mind. He will be remembered as a man who changed the world and how we looked at it ...  Thank you Steve. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Pirates of The Silicon Valley was the movie that make me become interesting about Steve and Apple. I starting read news about Steve and Apple. Watch every product launching presentation from Steve in YouTubes. This guy is really a eccentric but an awesome superhuman. Really feel sad of his depart. 
He is simply the best and most talented human being of his generation. We will never forget him, his vision, drive and determination.   Please extend my sympathies to his family, we think of you and your great loss. God bless you.
 I am very sorry to hear that Steve is gone. But, he will always be remembered for his ability to change the world, one apple product at a time. I also want to thank him and i hope he is in a better place now.
My thoughts to his family and friends who must be suffering greatly I am very sad and I hardly knew him, though Steve Jobs was one of my all time heroes 
I'm so sad Thank you Mr.steve for sharing your imagination with the world. You will always be remembered&nbsp;
Deep condolences Steve jobs, I wish you all the way walk good.
       I lost part of my technology world. He is my aspiration, he was one of the reasons of my new tech knowledge.he made the real changes, he made the real technology, he made the impossible. Will NEVER forget you ever. your tunes will keeps you alive, in everything you made and everything have not made yet, at least in my life time.
We have lost a great man. Steve has personally touched my life through his innovative products. That does not compare to the personal lose of his family and friends; however, he will be missed by all.   God bless those who are grieving in their personally lose. Be thankful for the memories all of you share.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs was not only a visionary but an implementer. He gave us products that were thought of as difficult to make or impossible but he did and made it easy and simple to apply in our daily lives, that they were not mere gadgets but tools that made life a bit easier.   Whenever I see or touch apple, I will remember Steve. Farewell Steve.
 Steve Jobs, a great mind, Get out of life to enter History. Rest in Peace.             
Steve Jobs has inspired me in more ways than I can put into words. He was brilliant and visionary and influenced the entire world. The universe will be sad for its loss of a genius and the most inspiring man living today, easily.   I feel like I have lost a family member, a close friend-- someone who I can't explain how he has touched my life, but has in every way.   Rest In Peace Steve Jobs, I send good wishes for your family and will never forget you. 
Rest in peace Steve Jobs. You were a true inspiration.  With my deepest sympathy, 
I'm out of words He is a good man giving creative and changed the world he might have died in person but I will always be touched by him and he is always alive within me he inspired alout of people and he deserves to be will remembered always.  I'm out of words now i'm shooked wish I had the chance to meet him in person.  To his family I can't picture your greef and he will always be your hero and mine.
My deepest sympathy to Steve's family! The world has lost a true genius! Thank you Steve, you have made my life easier and more enjoyable. I too have battled cancer and prayed for you.  Sent from my iPad 
Prayers for the family and friends for comfort at this sad time. 
My first computer is an Apple ll. It has changed my life. My career, my entertainment and a lot more. Steve, you have aways been my inspiration and I think it will be until the day I dead. 
I've drawn so much inspiration from Steve and his work. I feel like I've lost a childhood hero.   Wish I could have gotten to meet you at least once in my life. I'll miss you. Those keynotes won't be the same with out you there.  Here's to you Steve. You were crazy enough to change the world.&nbsp;
 My deepest empathy and condolence  to  Mr. Job's Family and apple.  Today the world has lost true great human and Innovator. I never had opportunity to meet him personly, But  He has touch our lives in so many ways. &nbsp;May his soul rest in  peace.
Mr Jobs, RIP. Our hearts go out to your family.  Grew up with Star Trek. You made my dream come true with iphone. You embodied the best of mankind-human vision, human courage and  human self-belief. You will always be remembered with affection and admiration. One man can make a difference.&nbsp;
i hope you did all you had set out to do, you are an inspiration and  responsible for much laughter and knowledge.
I'm an artist and a graphic designer, and I just wanted to say that because he did what he loved (and did it well), Steve Jobs has let me do what I have a passion for as well. Without his creativity and inspiration, I wouldn't have the tools to do what I do. Apple facilitates a lot of my creative process, and makes my life so much easier. I couldn't imagine trying to get by without my macbook, ipod, or iphone. He was truly an inspiring person.&nbsp;
I am not an employee of Apple, but I am really sad about his passing. He was an extraordinary man with an incredible vision. We loss someone great. This world will not be the same without him. Apple will not be the same without him.
Certainly God will see the apple with new eyes…&nbsp;
Thank you for being who you are and for dragging all the companies to evolve and make human life easier when dealing with computers.
Today the world has lost a truly great inventor and business person! You have changed the world, thanks for everything. R.I.P&nbsp;
I'm just writing because I felt that I couldn't go to sleep if I don't do it. Sincerely, I want to give you all my condolences. &nbsp;Steve was a technology genius for a lot of people, but he was human and that was the most awesome thing about him. Some years ago I saw his speech in Stanford University, and I realize that we just have one way to get whatever we want... just dream and follow our heart...He made me realize about it, and that is why today I'm writing to you.... I would love to meet him, but it was not possible, but I'm happy just thinking that he was in this world to teach us this... Today is a sad day for a lot of people, hope you can feel our love
RIP Steve Jobs! You were part of the creation of Pixar one of the biggest inspirations of my life. You created the Apple industry which fuels my creativity and inspiration. You were a great CEO and spectacular visionary. I am so shocked right now. The Apple glow on our macbook pros will glow for you!&nbsp;
 God bless and rest in peace Steve, you've earned it! Thank You!&nbsp;
I would just like to say Steve was an amazing inspiration for me and I'm  sad to see him pass. Rest in peace Steve Jobs you have created a company  like no other. 
May you RIP, Mr. Jobs. This world is a better place because of you.  
Today is a sad day for geeks everywhere. I still have my plush   smackamac that my father gave to me as a little girl. we never owned   anything other than a apple product and in our home we were always   "early adopters". Steve Jobs is a representation of being fearless, a   dreamer and even of second chances. At the age of 27 being born in the   year of Macintosh 1984 my life will always be affected and changed   because of Steve Jobs. Thank you for all of your contributions.&nbsp;
   I live in Brazil and I can't even start telling how sorry I am for this great lost. We have so much to thank him. I hope that he was aware of that when he was alive. A great genius doesn't die, he rests. His memory will be forever with us.               
It has been a pleasure to use Apple from the beginning and to see such a person create such a product for the world is a miracle in itself. Truly a wonderful man who will be missed. God bless.
Thank you for all your hard work and dedication!!
So long Steve, thanks for all the toys!&nbsp;
The first computer we ever owned was an Apple, and my parents have had them every since, I can still remember the joy I felt when I received my first IPod and I am about to receive my first IPhone, thank you Steve for sticking your vision and changing the world in the process, you will be missed and you will always be loved for your contributions. I will miss you even though i never met you and that is the greatest compliment I can pay you.
Thanks Steve to change our world, to change our lives, to change the way  that we all live, to make our lives easy.  THANK YOU. 
Steve jobs has meant so much in my life with the Apple computer, a  career in the graphic arts centering around the Mac, music and photography on my precious iMac,  a son who programs, a  daughter about to get her first iPhone, I can't imagine a world without Apple, Steve you will be missed but we  know your spirit will live on! Thank You!
Thanks Steve for everything you've given us.  You have revolutionized so many industries and we are all better off for your contributions to the global society.  You will be missed beyond measure.  God bless Steve.&nbsp;
Sudden tragedies remind of the fragility of life,  Steve Jobs was not just important to his friends, family and co-workers but to the world, we have all lost a visionary and a man who sought the good in all things, but we must honour the legacy he has left behind, one that will prosper for many years to come and through this Steve remains with us all.  Thank you Steve for changing the lives of so many, and may you Rest in Peace. 
Steve Jobs has truly inspired me as an individual and I wish his family  and friends my sincerest condolences.&nbsp;
I would like to wish the best to Steve's family and all people on Apple... We have lost a huge part of this world, this world that could't be this without his creations... I'm really sorry... I always loved Steve's creations... I always followed him from here... I will remember him and his quotes... for ever Thanks Steve! Thanks for all wonderfull things that you have bring to our lifes...&nbsp;
The lights are a little dimmer tonight because Steve Jobs has passed  from this earth. His vision and imagination brought light into the lives  of so many. We will miss you, Steve, even though we never personally  knew you. 
Apple has changed my life, thanks to you.&nbsp;
Dear Apple, I remember in 1986 at 13 years old getting an Apple IIC and how utterly amazing it was. Now at 38 years old I can't fathom life without the innovations that Steve and Apple have provided for us as well as Pixar, the mouse and other design and media. Thank you Steve...I write this with tears in my eyes but joy in my heart. We will all miss you terribly but you will live on in all  of our hearts.&nbsp;
Prayers for the family of Steve. What a great visionary. He will be missed.&nbsp;
It seems absolutely absurd to say that a phone changed my life, but it's true. In fact I don't look at my phone as a thing I use to call people it's a tool I use to become who I am. It has molded me and made me smarter, much faster, (lost 25 pounds using an app) I've made so many friends using it! I've found my way and discovered new places, food, games. To think that one man brought to life this period of human intellect. Apples devices have made us all more aware of our planet as a whole our community or connection to each other. They have helped teach us how complicated our "systems" have become and  we now know things must change. We will change them! Thank you Steve for your beautiful life.... Thank you for helping touch so many, for bringing us together and for shooting for perfection! You will be missed you will be loved and never forgotten!&nbsp;
I think, my first using a Mac is 1997. I was very surprised its interface better than PC. In 1998, when I saw the iMac I was attached its beautiful design. Steve was an icon and very powerful inspiration for me. I have been happy with his creative items such as iPod. Thank you, Steve. I appreciate to live at the same time with you. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,                       I can remember the first time I saw my first macintosh in person was when  i was being  shown around my prospective secondary school, they had nine macs, it was 1985, I knew i had to go this school because it must be some kind of super school if it had nine macs. They were so beautiful and i remember the sense of wonder when i first used them.                    I am so sad at the loss of Steve Jobs, I just to offer my condolences to his family, friends and colleagues, I have loved Apple macs for twenty seven years, I was so happy when he came back in 1996 to guide Apple back from the brink and was happy and thrilled at all the success that Steve and everybody at Apple has achieved. I will miss the Keynotes and product introduction and of course, the one more thing. It will never be the same again.&nbsp;
I cannot express my sadness over this, Our world is dealing with a huge loss . He will be missed. He was an amazing man. His creations and thoughts are still with us, in our hands, our ears, and on our desks. We love him and hopefully he will be with us in spirit.&nbsp;
My first computer was a Mac Plus. After upgrading it to 4mb RAM and adding a 10mb hard drive, I knew I would NEVER need anything else! I was only partially wrong because while I did end up needing a few more upgrades, it was always Steve that provided them. Thanks for the vision!  R.I.P.&nbsp;
I would just like to say that Steve was the reason I loved apple. I just  became an appleite about three years ago and have been hooked ever  since. From getting my first iPod to forcing my mom to get an iPhone  to getting my first mac which I love like a baby. Steve was a brilliant  man and will forever be part of history. He will forever be the face of  Apple. He is truly and amazing person. He is my hero. 
Steve Jobs left behind a legacy of innovation and inspiration, pushing technology to its limits and changing the way our societies function. I truly respect him as a one of the most influential figures of our time. My condolences to his family, his friends and the Apple community.&nbsp;
One of my goals in life was to meet Steve Jobs in person and learn about  his vision and great achievements. Unfortunately that goal cannot be  completed now because of his passing. He was a great visionary,  inspirational figure, and a great CEO. I actually think he did make a  dent in the Universe with bringing his intelligent ideas to life. I can  say that another goal I had was to be hired by Apple and fortunately  that has been accomplished recently. It was great working for Steve  Jobs. He will never be forgotten. I will always miss and remember him.  One day, when it's my time, I will hopefully be able to meet this man in  the next life.&nbsp;
 He is in a better place where there is no pain. Will be remembered   forever.&nbsp;
Thank you Mr. Jobs, for everything. You have forever changed the lives of billions of people. This world is a better place because of you.&nbsp;
I just want to say thank you. Your products have changed my life. Now God can use your genius in heaven. God Bless You Steve and May You Rest In Peace.
I'm deeply saddened by the loss of this great visionary. His legacy and  astronomic achievements will live on and it would be impossible to  forget the charismatic leader of Apple. 
You have no idea how your company's ideas have sincerely enriched my life. I  have met some of the greatest friends of my life through your technology. Steve, you put communication, you put information, you put the world, you put  my friends in the palm of my hand, and in my pocket. You made the computer a  personal connection. I will miss your ideas.
The world has just lost a man whose ideas became standards. 
Thank you Steve Jobs for sharing your vision with the world. Rest in peace.   
I wish to express how absolutely sad it was for me to find out about Mr. Jobs' passing!  Even though I never met Mr. Jobs, Tonight I feel as if a close friend or family member has died.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve Jobs, for everything you have created.   You will always be an example of excellence, tact and artistry.  My prayers go out to your family.   May you rest in peace.           Love,  A tiny part of the Apple family  
when I saw the news on television that Steve Jobs had died, it ruined my day, and Steve Jobs for me is irreplaceable, a name that will never be forgotten, Steve Jobs in my opinion, a true genius of technology. Steve Jobs? in my opinion a true Warrior, Steve Jobs has peace,&nbsp;
Steve shaped my life in many ways. I've followed him since the early 80s and have always been in awe of his creative genius. He changed the way we live, work, entertain, and educate ourselves, by  giving us the first computer  that was really personal, and allowing us to conceive music, communications and books in an entirely different manner. His commencement speech at Stanford a few years back is a must listen/read for all. I can't help but feel  his passing as a personal loss and my only wish is that his genius continues to live on through the fantastic company he created. Long live Apple!
<div>The Apples change the world: Adams, Newtons and Steve Jobs!! &nbsp;An immortal human being.</div>
 Dear Laurene, When my girlfriend texted me on my iPhone today telling me that Steve Jobs had died, my heart stopped. How can such a giant die, a person who had done so much for the world must be immortal. Words cannot even begun to explain how terribly sorry i am for your loss. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs, you will be missed.
This is really really sad for all of us..his fans. I think i have not been this sad about the passing away of a CEO of a Co. ever.   God sometimes takes such brilliant, innovative and great human beings earlier. I guess it is HIS way of letting us know what we are going to miss the most.    May his family have the courage to bear this deep loss.   My condolences &amp; prayers.&nbsp;
I am so sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs. I was on the Apple website looking at the new iPhone 4s, when I went back to the main page and saw the picture of Steve. It may seem strange but I started to cry. I never knew Steve Jobs personally, but I looked forward to everyone one of his Keynote speeches and set reminders for when they would be on, so I could get excited about my next Apple purchase. We spend hours as a family in the Apple Stores, because it just feels like home. Steve was a brilliant man and so excited about his work! Not many people get to go to work each day and be that excited and proud of what you do for work.&nbsp;  To the Apple Team - know that Steve is still with each of you and he will be watching to see what great products you come up with in the future.  Make Steve proud!
Steve  -  WELL DONE!   Creating so many beautiful and functional products  The constant pursuit of excellence – firmness, commodity and delight  Apple computers have become exquisite jewels  Where even opening the box is exciting  A rare architectural experience where less is more and more and more...WELL DONE Steve! 
You will always be remembered.
Steve jobs was my idol and my hero. His work and dedication to the work he loved inspired and saved me from my downfall. He has had one of the greatest impacts on my life and I will always remember him and he will live on forever  through every apple emblem. The world has lost one of the greatest. Already  miss the legacy.
Dear Apple,  Although I'm only thirteen and that I wasn't there for the creation of Apple, I always have heard my father say that Steve Jobs represented the American Dream and that he was his ideal role model. I agree with that statement entirely and I am sorry for your loss. &nbsp; &nbsp;
You are an angel now... if you need I have some beats for your iPod in heaven... 
Most of the world misses you, the rest of them don't know how much they will miss you.
There are too many things I'd like to say. He has given the world a light of hope; made it braver, brighter and smarter. As I write this email from my iPhone, the rest of the world's Apple products are probably roaring with activity throughout the rest of the world. If there was ever such a thing as world peace, Steve Jobs' creations brought the world just a little closer together. Because of Apple, I got a chance to start a life and career I never thought i could have. So thank you Apple, Thank You Steve Jobs.   We love you and will miss you. The world tonight is united for the first time in human history.   Please give my condolences to his closest friends and family. My prayers go out to him.
I have been an Apple fan for many years and I know that Steve was the force behind all those great products. I will miss him and his thoughts of what was to be.
Steve was an amazing innovator, extraordinarily creative, thought out of the box and made all of us 'think'!     We will miss you Steve.You have been an inspiration to me and all of the people who want to build something one day!     May your soul rest in Peace.&nbsp;
 I would like to send my condolences to all of his family and friends and I would like to say that he was an incredibly inspiring person and I hope that he died in peace, knowing how much people admired him and loved everything he created.
Steve is handing you the flashlight, wants you to search out the next horizon.  We have our fingers crossed that you will terrify the next generation of engineers and designers as much as he did the last two.&nbsp;
Steve, you changed how we live, how we work, how we interact, how we communicate. From a grateful person and a grateful world, we know you are in a better place but we'll miss your constant refusal to entertain average.&nbsp;
You were our very own thomas edison, our very own promise of progress.   
Steve Jobs is an amazing man. Always coming up with new and revolutionary products, inventing genius ideas and his amazing stage presence made him the best CEO ever. A human being will be hard pressed to aspire to a better founder, creator and mentor other than Steven Paul Jobs. One can only hope that Apple will continue with its legacy as making the best products known to man without this amazing leader. My condolences to his family, I am grieving his loss, but I cannot imagine the grief of his wife and children. Although he is dead and gone, his legacy, life and leadership will continue forever and despite the terrible tragedy, let us rejoice at the wonder of being able to watch Steven Paul Jobs ignite the spark that flamed into a  bonfire of a company we now call Apple Inc.  My deepest condolences and heartfelt grief. 
A man that made a huge difference. RIP Steve.
Hey Steve,   Can I call you Steve? We have never met, so maybe it's Mr. Jobs? But   you have been a large part of my life for many years now so if you   don't mind too much, I will just call you Steve. This may be entirely   pointless  but I just want to thank you. I want to thank you for   opening doors into new worlds and brighter futures. You have changed   the lives of millions, including mine. From the techy dad who talked   of you to the colored mac desktops that I had in elementary school...   I remember thinking those were the most amazing things ever by the   way. And Bugdom became my complete obsession for my entire 3rd grade   career....But to be honest you really came into my life with your   innovation of the ipod. Pure genius. And you cemented yourself in my   life with Macbook. And please note, I am not talking about the objects   themselves so much as what they have meant to me, what they have done   for me, and where they have taken me. You will never know just how   much you have done for me or how much you have changed the lives of   millions, it's probably incomprehensible. But I just want to say thank   you once again, from the bottom of my heart. Im grateful for your   life, your sacrifices, your innovation, and your life.&nbsp;
R.I.P Steve Jobs, Thank you for all the happiness, surprise and future you show us. 
" From the other side of the world, Steve has inspired me in times of uncertainty. I read and re-read his famous speech given to Stanford University - thanks to Technology, we will still be touched by your inspiring thoughts."  Thanks and farewell!
Apple, personified by Steve Jobs, has been a decades-long influence on both my work and home lives in ways that have become so integral that I could not imagine how different it would have been without it. While I'm sure that Apple will continue to lead and innovate, and no doubt succeed, I will miss having what I've always felt to be a connection with the soul of the company. My career as a graphic designer began before Macintosh, and when it arrived it seemed to confirm that there was someone in the computer world who shared the way creative people think. Some of the best memories I have were waiting for Steve to take the stage for MacWorld's keynote, and have him amaze us with just one more glimpse of a future that was starting at that moment. I am glad that he was able to see Apple flourish under his leadership, and to know the appreciation that users everywhere had for his contribution to the technology that enriches our lives.
I'm sitting here in front of my computer and cannot believe I'm this upset over the death of a man who I never met. But I'm slowly realizing that he wasn't just any man. I've listened to his 2005 Stanford commencement speech perhaps 20 times and his description of death is the most fitting today; "death is very likely the single best invention of life." He finally became the "old" but paved the way for the "new." An innovator, an inspiration to those with dreams of greatness, he led Apple to become the only company that, in my opinion, got me to buy their products mainly because he introduced them. Truly a sad day. 
An amazing human being and truly one of the most inspirational individuals of our time. Thank you for your beautiful mind and magnificent contributions to our culture.&nbsp;
 When I heard Steve Jobs had died I felt immeasurably sad. I have never  met him, I did not know him but I live with his products every day. More  importantly, I have been in awe of his vision, his creativity, his  genius for so long and will miss his presence in this world.  We will  all miss him so much&nbsp;
 Thank you for creating a wonderful world for us through Apple Computers. True visionary and innovator. A King of your domain. You will be missed. God Bless.&nbsp;
You did good job!  May God bless you.  God want to change his world with you but we miss you.       
its a sad sad day, reading about Steve's passing  his genius has been in building a company, which produces products, and interfaces, which bring constant pleasure, and sublime ease of use to many of us on a day to day basis  bon voyage Steve  you have left the world a much better place, by making many of the things we do so much easier, and so much more fun ! 
Dear Steve in Heaven God created the world and gave us Steve Jobs. I may have not known you   at personal level, but have come to cherish the works of yours hands,   soul and spirit. You made Africa develop in communication, so fast   that Kenya is now compared to any other developed country in the world   in terms of communication. My Dear God, Thank You for Giving us Steve Jobs. RIP our Steve Jobs, for I shall always appreciate you.   Kind Regards.&nbsp;
I feel like I have just lost a very close friend..a source of inspiration..a  great spirit. You had touched a very special place in my heart and earned the most respect from me as a human being. Your works, your words, your legend will always remain in my heart forever. Your story will become much-told as a historic hero. Rest in peace, Mr.Jobs.
I am deeply sad to find out Jobs passed away this morning. He and his spirit is going to be with us forever. Thanks so much for creating so many wonderful and amazing Apple things for us, which made a big change in my life and others around me. Thanks for so many great presentations which I shared with my students in a China English language learning class. Those presentations helped me and my students to learn things in many ways beyond learning a foreign language. We see the innovation, spirit and inspiration through all of them. Thanks for making the world better.  
Steve Jobs has made such a big difference in my life.  He will be missed by his friends, family, and fans.
 To the entire Apple family...   Because he did it so well... all of you who followed Steve have unfailingly and courageously kept your eyes on tomorrow.     Today, you'll lower your gaze for a time.   To look around at all there is, here, today, to cherish and celebrate...   And yes... you'll also look down to mourn.  But remember... Tomorrow is waiting.   And when you get there... Steve will get there too.   Here's to the Crazy Ones...
RIP Steve, a true American Original, by whom we were greatly blessed.
My condolences to Family &amp; Friends of Steve Jobs. What a Genius, should  have had a Nobel Prize! He will be sadly missed.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs and the company he built forever changed our lives and inspired  a generation. What a loss for our nation, but an even greater loss for his  family and friends. He will be missed by millions.
 My deepest condolences to Steve Jobs's family. The world has lost to great person. I'm very very sorry.&nbsp;
Steve was indeed a visionary.  Its rare to see someone master their craft with the same finesse as Steve.  Some compare him to Edison, I would compare him to Einstein.  The man was more than a visionary, he was a pioneer, executioner and simply put, a genius who has changed the world in ways we have yet to discover.  Its rare to see a fellow technologist receive the Nobel Piece award for their contributions but I think he is long overdue and if I¹m ever asked, he has my vote.  God Bless  you Steve.&nbsp;
He brought wonderful things to all.  He brought forth the idea that  people could have a computer in their home without having to be a rocket  scientist.  His gift was bringing the world in the hands of everyone,  from school kids to grandparents.  He never stopped giving until he  could give no more.  I know that he instilled that same excitement in  those that work for Apple today.  Nonetheless, he will be sadly missed.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs  has become part of a greater design. Your legacy will not be forgotten. R.I.P.&nbsp;
  My condolences to Steve Job’s family. He was a real visionary and true intellect of our generation. May his soul rest in peace.
Only the good die young&nbsp;&nbsp;A visionary&nbsp;&nbsp;A master&nbsp;&nbsp;A poet of innovation&nbsp;May he be able to impact the heavens as he did the earth....  An Apple a day, now has new meaning.
RIP Steve!  Thank you for the iPhone, iPad, AppleTV, and MacBook!!! 
Thank you for the life of Steve Jobs. His vision, creativity and  courage. He has given us and continues to give us, unlimited hours of  immense pleasure and satisfaction due to the exemplary nature of Apple  products created under his stewardship. Our thoughts and prayers are  with his family, friends and colleagues.
I would just like to let Apple and Steve Jobs' family know that he was a  great inspiration to me ever since I was a kid using my brand new eMac  which helped me discover the wonders of both the internet and the world itself. Thank you Steve.
My heartfelt condolences to Mr. Jobs' family. I am and have always been an Apple computer devotee. If I did not have a Mac, I would not have a computer, and I use a computer for everything. I am 53 years old, so I have watched the remarkable things Steve Jobs did for Apple from the beginning, and I really like his style. The world is less without him, may he rest in peace.&nbsp;
We will miss you, Steve Jobs. You have transformed our lives, and the social fabric of the entire world, with your genius. Our thoughts go out to his family, and all of his extended family at the Apple stores everywhere.&nbsp;
Goodbye and rest in peace, Mr.Jobs... indeed u have revolutionized the way we lived.  i am so glad that i own  Apple products and u have been in my life not directly, but once before. thanks for the great memories and technology.  u will be missed...
I am so sorry to hear about Steve's passing he was a  wonderful, bright, and intelligent man. He changed the whole world in only just a few years. I wish his family the best and keeping them in my prayers. He could’ve changed the world a whole lot more but wish you the best. R.I.P. Steve Jobs
Steve brought enjoyment to millions through innovative technologies. World will miss his visions and dreams. My sincere condolences to the Jobs and Apple family.
Thank you for improving the quality of my life.
Steve and the original Mac team made computers that people could use.  His ideas made computers interesting and useful, and they are why I do what I do today. &nbsp;
Thank you, Steve, for saving Apple when times were dark.  Thank you for having the vision to take Apple places no-one thought it  could go. You certainly surprised me!  I remember seeing the first "Think Different" commercial on TV late one  night and tearing up. I knew, then, change was coming. I knew you sent  that message out to us -- the faithful -- telling us that everything was  going to be okay now that you were back. Telling us that things would  never be the same -- and they'll never be the same after the products  you helped create.  I'll keep the faith. If ever I'm cut, I will always bleed in six colors.  You will be missed.  My heart goes out to your family.
Dear Steve Jobs, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. You brought culture and taste and design and innovation to a field that  has ultimately changed all of our lives and will continue to do so. You  will be missed.   --&nbsp;
 I am a Computer Information Technology Graduate student and an Army Captain in the Florida National Guard.  Today marks a very sad day for me and my constituents as Apple products and the innovation of Steve Jobs has defenitely revolutionized the world of technology and business as we know it.  I extend my greatest and warmest of condolences to the family of Steve Jobs and pray that his legacy lives on.      P.S. Thank You very much Steve Jobs for all that you have done for the world.
He is a genius, a tough guy and man who changed the world. God bless him  and his families. 
Thanks for your brilliance, and creative mind. You made my life so much   cooler, convenient, relaxing and easier. OH WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT MY IPOD AND MACBOOK PRO? RIP Thanks with love.&nbsp;
You literally put every song I have ever heard into a small box. That is pretty cool. 
 With deepest sympathy to Steve's family, friends, and the Apple family.  The world has lost a true visionary and a leader in the industry.  Competitors can only hope to accomplish what Steve Jobs did in his too short time on Earth.  What a legacy he has left here.  RIP Steve.             
Steve Jobs' story is an american story. A story about pursuing greatness in all its facets. After reading an authorized biography, called Icon, I  began to pursue my own dreams and greatness, living my great american story. Steve Job's story of struggle and setbacks-only to revolutionize  how we communicate will always be inspiring, Rest in Peace!  
iSad   The world is forever grateful for your innovative mind.  I will send this email from the innovation and the mind of Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs, is the Henry Ford of my generation.  He did not create the industry, he revolutionized it.    Thank you for your contribution to technology. 
Just want to share my condolences with the Apple team and Jobs family. It's been a pleasure, Steve! Thank you for changing my world. 
Today the world lost an amazingly talented leader, visionary, and human being. Steve Jobs was more than just the face of Apple, he was the one that changed the way we use and interact with our computers. While never one to brag on himself, he never let you forget how proud he was of his company, his products, and most importantly his employees.   Steve Jobs will be missed.
Da Vinci, Mozart, Newton, Franklin, Jobs  Nobody is out of place at that table.  RIP Steve.  
I'm speechless.  What a visionary leader and iconic figure.  He will be missed! 
 Dear Steve,  Rest in Peace.
Steve will always be remembered from people around the world.  He was a very creative, smart, and wonderful guy, and shall never be forgotten.  R.I.P Steve, you will be missed. 
Thank you for all your contributions to the Tech Industry. You will be missed.
thank you for making the lives of millions so fun and exciting! 
Steve Jobs, I love all your have created. Pray for you live forever in world's soul,  God bless you! &nbsp;
Steve, In years to come, your story will begin like that of a fairy tale.  We will all say, "Once upon a time, there was a man named Steve. Steve Jobs..." Thank you for making our fairy tales and dreams more real and tangible than we ever could have imagined. You, Steve Jobs, changed the world and forever changed how this world connects. Rest well, Steve, you deserve it.&nbsp;
Danke für die Aufregende Zeit, die du uns geschenkt hast. Vor allem allen Technik begeisterten wirst du sehr fehlen. Die Krankheit hat dein Körper besiegt, doch deine Visionen werden weiter leben.  Ein herzliches Beileid an die Familie.  By-by Steve 
I knew that Steve was ill, but tonight's headlines still hit me as hard as any death of any public figure has in my lifetime.  I got my first Mac in my teens -- the very first generation, with no interior hard drive. I never looked back.  I have quit jobs because my employers refused to provide me with an Apple computer.   Steve Jobs has represented the best in innovative energy that this country -- and world -- has to offer.  My deepest condolences to his family, his friends, his colleagues, and to the world.  We are all much poorer today.&nbsp;
I am extremely saddened to hear the news.  We all love you for your great work for the mankind and will you miss you always.  May his soul rest in peace. 
The co-founder of Apple, a genius, a person who made this world different for millions or probably billions of people passed away! He was a bottomless source of inspiration for his colleagues and friends, and proved to everyone BUT absolutely EVERYONE that efforts and dedication to what one does can make this world better! His unique genius introduced PIXAR as one of the&nbsp;the world's&nbsp;greatest if not the greatest cartoon companies. He is gone, but his main and undoubtedly most magnificent foundation will stay with us and every day hundreds and thousands of people all over the globe will pick up their IPHONES, IPODS, IPADS, MACBOOKS and remember him as one of the most incredible persons of all times!&nbsp;
Thank you steve for all you hardwork. You will be greatly missed.   
Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family. Steve, may you rest   in peace.
I did comps with glue and paper, ideas with tissue and type with hot   wax....and then they brought a Mac into work and everything I had   learned in college and every skill I had mastered as a graphic   designer up to that moment went flying out the window. It was a train   that you had to jump on–or get left behind. I jumped and have never   looked back. Every day, every project, every computer...it's been a   love and a joy. Thanks Steve and every one at Apple. Please keep the   train rolling!&nbsp;
steve jobs will always be our leader that led us to a new era of  technology that has changed the world.
I love my Apple products and I will always remember that Steve Jobs was the guy who brought these beautiful innovations to us. I will always remember him, I grew up with him, and the world has lost a great inventor.  There is no one else like him. He will be greatly missed! 
I never knew Steve personally, but I always admired his hard work and dedication to bring back a near (bankrupt) company into a multi-billion dollar organization. He changed the way the music industry works, and introduced the world with iPods which made our music life a lot easier. Steve was a genius and a dedicated man, and its sad to see him go. Steve was a one of a kind man, and its hard to see him go. My condolences to Steve, and his family, and hope this email helps. 
I remember when I bought my first Apple.  It was a 2GS.  My friends  laughed at me until they tried it.  They stopped laughing.  It has been  a joy from that day forward through many Apple products, powerbooks,  desktops and always it seemed, I was in the minority among my peers, yet  secretly just laughing at them as they remained staunch in there defense  of PC and Microsoft.  Eventually, one by one they all migrated over to  an Apple product as they finally realized what I had known all along.   That to work on an Apple product, to use one, was just easy and fun.  No  question.  Steve Jobs changed the way I utilized technology and I will  always, always be forever thankful for his brilliance and daring.  It was fitting that I heard of his passing on my iPhone in a text.  My heart goes out to his family.
Steve will be missed dearly from my family and I as he he was more than all my friends thought. He wasn't just a man who made a phone or computer he was THE man that made THE phone and computer in a better way. He was my hero if h e could have a higher role that was past hero it would be him. While Microsoft may had put computers in offices he put the in loving family's. So I here  declare that you not just be a man, but be THE man. 
I remember the first iPod, I still have it because I love looking at how far  apple has come from that point. A brick iPod to a sleek iPhone. Steve jobs was a genius and it breaks my heart to know someone so intelligent didn't stay on this earth for longer because he could have done so many more amazing things. He changed the world, and now that he's gone I think people are realizing how much of an impact he had on all our lives. He will live on forever through apple and I hope that brings some peace to his family and friends.
Dear Steve,  I watched my brother drop out of school at the age of 10 because he as dedicated to learn the technology that you introduced.  My brother is now a high end Mac based web designer and I wanted to say thank you for your vision.  You have changed our world for the better.  Rest in Peace dear friend. 
"A world without  geniuses requires the intervention of a higher power  in order to evolve." Steve, you made my artistic life easier, and opened a magnificent window  for creative opportunities with your innovative tools.  Thanks for your existence and the unique inspiration you gave to us all,  artists and photographers.  You will be missed for a long, long time.&nbsp;
One of the great mind of 21th century has left us. He was not only the founder of Apple, but also the founder of the new era of information technology. He's creation will never be surpass and duplicate. Rest in space, and to Steve's family, have an happy life after 
Gracias por todo.  Apple y el mundo no va a ser lo mismo.  Abrazos grandes a los familiares y a la familia apple.&nbsp;
Steve, You have been and will always be 'Apple'. We have lost an icon and a  legend. You will be missed by all.&nbsp;
My daughter has born in the same day that the iPad was announced to the press. Today she plays with her iPad with an incredible ability: she can browse videos, choose apps, play games, turn on/off the device. For her, all of it is something very common.  I stay very happy when I see her playing like this because I know she can do it because one man one day dreamed about it. And dedicated his life to make this dream real.  Thank you Steve, thank you to make our lives full of magic. Thank you to transform technology in something more than a box full of possibilities, but a bright screen of happiness.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve,  I would not be where I am now without your vision.Your life was a road map which taught me how to face adversity  Rest in Peace.
Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being, and me, I have lost an idol.  So sad, so shock. Goodbye Steve Jobs  
Steve Jobs was to communications and computing what Beethoven was to music - an unsurpassed force of invention. All best to all his family, friends, and colleagues.&nbsp;
My boyfriend and I are Korean and feel very sorry to lost Mr. Jobs today.  We only know him through media but somehow need to write something for him after hearing this sad news.  Maybe we just realize how much we have appreciated some innovate products that he put his inspiration.  We don't only appreciate for the products, we appreciate more for showing his attitude toward life. He gives people the hope by overcoming many difficulties he had been through.  Thank you very much Steve Jobs.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
what a shame he's gone. a great that revolutionized the world. his legacy will always be alive.&nbsp;
Farewell and God's blessings to a man who ushered in a new era of technology and communication. My heart goes out to Steve¹s family and friends. May they find comfort in knowing he has gone on to a better place, and lived his life the best he could while here on Earth. 
So sorry for the lose....my thoughts and prayers go out to his family. He made a huge impact on my life...I am a iPhone user and I love it.  R.I.P Steve Jobs.
This has brought a tear to my eye.  It was clear that he was having  problems and it is a tribute to his efforts that he worked right up to  the end through his passion and belief in everything he did.  Steve, you touched and inspired me as you did many, many other people  all over the world.  Your determination and pure belief in what was  right over what was perceived to be right has influenced a generation.  Your Keynote speeches were concentrated passion and always held the  attention of the world as they watched.  Genuinely, watching your  presentation for permission to build the new Apple HQ, I couldn't help  but feel that you were giving every last thing you had to secure the  important efforts of what you had created.  You are at peace now but will always be remembered for everything you  are and were.  I will miss you.
A once in a lifetime visionary. A great storyteller and marketer. The man behind the now ubiquitous products and new categories of things. Steve Jobs made technology fun. He made new product introductions an event. He inspired me as a fangirl and one of those mentee's he never met. What a great life! 
My heart aches at the passing of Steve Jobs, as if he was a member of my fam ily.  A true genius, visionary, creative Renaissance man.  A loss for all, but what we have all gained from his uncanny genius is immeasurable.  I write this on my iPad, surrounded by my iPhone, iMac, Apple TV, MacBook Pro.  RIP, Steve.  You will be missed, but your legacy lives on.  You have single- handedly changed the way we live.  With best wishes to his family and his Apple Family.   
Steve is the guy that changed the world throughout his creative technology. No one will ever replace him, his legend will live for the generations to come. Rest in peace Steve.
Rest in peace Steve. You have been someone who spent his Life making others lifes better.
I was 8 years old when my dad brought home our first computer. It was the late 80's, and it was a Macintosh. Fast forward to today, and I read the sad news on my MacBook. As a physician, I encounter death often. Every life is a miracle in its own way. The miracle of Steve's life is that through his vision, he managed to touch the lives of billions of people. That is why his death feels like a personal loss to me and countless others around the world.  My heartfelt condolences to his family and friends. He lived an amazing life, not because he created amazing products, but because he loved his family and followed his passions fearlessly. He is an example to us all.&nbsp;
In 1997 I was entering college and researching what type of computer to  get for my degree in Graphic Design. Steve's return was my decision  maker. I often think of his drive and vision for my own standards of  creativity and usability. His influence in our culture is remarkable.
So many great minds have passed into eternity, yet I have personally shed a tear for so few. I have known for quite some time that Steve Jobs has changed my world, my life, and my thinking. I did not foresee my tears and profound sadness on this day. Shine on you brilliant spirit, shine on....&nbsp;
He left his mark on the world, and will be missed. Please send my thoughts and love to his family, friend, and employees. Sending this from my favorite  thing, my iPad 2. 
To the Jobs Family, I am sorry for your loss. Steve Jobs made the world a better place. He was a true GENIUS and I am truly very sorry. Life will continue, however, that whole will never be filled in your family and Apple. GOD Bless and Deepest Sympathy.
Dear Apple,  I want to take a moment to remember and celebrate the life of the genius that Steve Jobs was.  Steve. You single handedly changed the way the world and how I interacted and consumed media. You converted me from a PC enthusiast to a Mac devotee. You created products of utmost beauty and simplicity. Who knows what else you would have invented had you lived on.  The world will never be the same without your pursuit of perfection. Nobody will ever replace you. May you rest in peace and may your legacy live on for generations to come.  I send my condolences to your family. I hope the world respects them while they mourn their loss.  RIP, Steve.
A huge, huge loss! Such an inspiration. 
Thanks Steve for change our world, we'll miss you always but we have your memory in our hards. Always remember you because your great contributions to the world. Rest in peace!             
Just simple: this world wouldn't be where it is today, if it was not   for him.  Respect the Jobs!!  
      Condolences to his family and his friends. This man has inspired many people around the world including myself.   He will live on in our memories. Forever immortal through Apple.  Rest well Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
The World with Steve Jobs becomes extraordinary. Now without him, we can only be more ordinary. Will always Remember Steve Jobs. &nbsp;&nbsp;
I remember Steve for his vision, his ability to succeed in spite of  personal hardship, his relentless drive for perfection and willingness  to take bold risks.  It's a good lesson for all of us.  My condolences to Steve's family and his friends.
 I just wanted to give my regards to the guy because he did so much for the tech world. One of the forefathers of the first Computers to the Iphone and wonderful Ipad, I thank Mr Jobs and Hope the Legacy of his ideas and innovations stay with apple for years to come. Don't let him down Apple veterans. Rest in peace&nbsp;
My condolences to the Jobs families and Apple families all over the world. May God bless you and your family. Thanks for being a pioneer of a great dynasty... We all will miss you... Thanks for everything that you have done for  us...God Bless.

What would the world be without Steve Jobs. What a blessing to have had him with us all of these years. My condolences goes out to his family and those who knew him. I know everyone at apple will continue to make his presence known by creating some of the best iPhones ever.&nbsp;
R.I.P     Dear Steve god have a new angel, thanks for all good things for our lives.     God bless u.... &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
The world has changed so dramatically because of you. We thank you for  having shared your visions with us through Apple and its products.  Rest in Peace. 
Its weird the sick feeling in my belly. I know he is only a man, and there are many other men that die. It is not even rational to me, I can't explain why I feel like it is so sad. I did not even know him. I owned one of the first Macs. The world burns a little dimmer now. Rest in peace Steve Jobs! You were an amazing man.&nbsp;
Steve, you changed my life and opened up my eyes in so many ways. May you rest in peace and my thoughts are with your family and close friends.&nbsp;
I wish I could somehow go back a dozen years and rediscover OSX, iPods, iPhones and iPads all over again. What a ride!  Thanks Steve, you changed the world!&nbsp;
I'm proud to have always been an admire of Steve Jobs for many years. I'm more proud that my children got the unique life experience to have  lived during the same time as such an amazing person. 
 I am 14 and live in Austin TX. I will forever remember how apple and Steve Jobs changed technology. You have moved us into the future and your memory will live on forever. Thank you Steve Jobs&nbsp;
Thank you for my childhood. Thank you for the butterflies we all felt waitin g to hear from you what is next. Thank you for our adulthood and making the impossible possible and making fun out of the mundane. Thank you for being re volutionary and showing us how to be evolutionary. Thank you for encouraging  us to stand on your shoulders, for you are a historic giant. You Mr. Jobs, Simply Work.
He was an amazing man with a vision who changed how we interact with computers, phones etc.  My thoughts and prayers are with all those who loved him and to all who were privileged to work with him.  May he rest in peace - he had a life well lived.&nbsp;
I would not have thought that I'll be this sad and upset to the news of someone's death, someone that I didn't even know personally. But I'm truly in grievance over the news of Steve job death, once every now and then, someone comes along that is light years ahead of their time. Steve was one of them, pity the rest of us were not fortunate enough to continue benefiting from his vision and brilliance. RIP Steve.&nbsp;
Thanks for all you have done Steve, I am and will forever be an apple fan because of the products you have made. The first computer I used was an old Mac at my middle school and I was was amazed. We all miss you Steve&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. Thank you for your creativity, your genius, your talent and your love for people who create. You were a great man.   God Bless you Steve Jobs. Rest in Peace.   With heart felt condolences.
Your crazy ideas made it so myself and people like me could do what they love for a living.  That alone makes you one of the most amazing people in the world.  You will be missed.  Never forgotten.  Cheers and thank you.&nbsp;
Your ideas have inspired me so much.  Rest in peace my friend!
You changed our lives and made the World a smaller and better place; thank you!
Always admired the great work of Steve Jobs. A man who transformed product presentations in great performances! Without a doubt a sad loss. My sincere condolences to the family and the company.&nbsp;
With the passing of Steve Jobs the world will forever miss an amazingly creative and insightful man.  My thoughts go out to his family at this difficult time for them. He was a brave human being who did indeed leave a dent in the world as he wanted to do.  And he did it in a most profound and creative way.  God bless you Steve.&nbsp;  
You will be missed and were an inspiration to us all.&nbsp;
RIP Genius we will remember  you forever like a person who change the way to see the world  Steve. Finally you are free, thank you for make us the life most easy and pretty.
He has changed the world , now he goes to change the heaven. He will change everything again and again and again.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You should be part of my future.... not part of my past.   You should be  part of our collective humanity and not yet part of our history.   In  times like this we need those very few that enable us to be more than we  can.   I am worried that the obvious no longer can be realized without  those visionary enough to see it.  Sleep Well... my Hero. 
To my friends at Apple,  I have recently joined the Apple family. I must say I have felt welcome from the start. Through the vision of Mr. Jobs, technology has improved our lives. I can honestly say, nothing has done more so recently for my family, friends, and my education more than Apple products has.  All of us can appreciate what the company has done for the world. And all of us can be grateful that Mr. Jobs shared his vision and talents with us while he was able to do so.  May you rest in peace, Steve.  And thank you - for everything.
I am from China. Although Jobs never been to this remote nation, his legend is familiar to people across this land. People respect and love Steve like he were their family member.  Although he has passed away, his charisma and talent will be treasured by the world and last forever.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs improved many moments in my life.  I found out my wife was pregnant over a video iChat while I was away for an extended work trip. I FaceTime with my kids very day when I'm at work. There's an endless list of life moments his vision has made possible for me personally. A great man who was not out to make money but to change the world for the better. The world needs more like Steve Jobs.
I would imagine that you must be receiving millions of emails and i  never had the pleasure to meet Steve but I just watched his Stanford  University Commencement video and almost cried. He is such an inspiring  human being and i'm sure everyone can agree with me even if they never  met him. I wish nothing but the warmest condolences for his family and  friends and i will keep them in my prayers. R.I.P
 He was a great person. &nbsp;Sent From The Cool Phone, Dude.
In 1979 I saved up my money for months and bought my first computer--an Apple II+. Since then the technology and invention that Steve Jobs has fostered has been a significant influence on my life. Thanks Steve. Rest in peace. My prayers for the Jobs family.   
Steve is a GREAT man and I feel very sorry about his death. I  will miss him so much. God bless him.
Steve is and will always be another Einstein of Technology.  Good Bye Steve.  God Bless.
What a sad day and a tragic loss.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family both at home and at Apple.  What a legacy he leaves.  Rest in Peace Steve. 
My first computer was an Apple ][ that my boss had on my desk waiting  for me on my first day.  It was one of the first 16,000 made.  We went on to have one of the first design Macs, a Lisa, and a Macintosh II.  My boss had vision, and was a great mentor to me.  Apple says that Steve Jobs was "an inspiring mentor."  These two men changed my life.  I am lucky to have known a great mentor, and the products of Steve  Jobs.  So, I can only have a pale view of the richness this man brought  to Apple and its employees.  Rest in peace, genius.  The world is a better place because of your life.
Thank you for everything you create. World become better because of you. Now rest in peace, have a nice dream. Thank you Steve.
Steve Jobs wasn't only an innovator but he seemed to intimately understand people. What we like, want, &amp; need. He inspired me with his limitless creativity but it was his deep understanding of humanity that made me admire him.  The world is a less brilliant place today and maybe we're all a little less understood too.
The world has lost one of its best.
Steve was a great inspiration to me.  I liked to learn about his  history, specifically how Apple was started in a garage.  I even used  that in my essay for applying to college.  I talked about my passion for  technology and how much I was inspired by the way Steve made his way to  the top.  I have started my path to become a computer engineer and I  will always think of Steve's way of doing things as a way of pushing  myself forward in hopes of becoming great someday. Without Steve we  would not be as advanced as we are in technology today and we have a lot  to learn from him.  Rest in peace Steve.  To your family and friends I am deeply sorry for  your loss, it's a loss to so many of us. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs passed away today, but his ideals will live on in the&nbsp;thousands&nbsp;of Apple employees that make it such a great company, and his tireless efforts to disrupt the status quo will be remembered by the&nbsp;millions of people around that world who use Apple's brilliantly innovative products everyday.  Thank you, Steve.
Rest in Peace Steve, thanks for all.&nbsp;
An amazing man.  One not soon forgotten. We don't know what comes after life, but we do know that Steve Jobs departed  knowing how much he was respected and loved.  He will be sadly missed.  Our  Sympathy to his family, his friends and Apple.   With heavy hearts in Connecticut 
 I can't think of any other company in the world where the CEO is that well know and liked, that I am compelled to write and say that he will be sadly missed. Clearly an incredible guy            
The world has lost a true innovator. Many people have been impacted by  his work and will mourn his absence.  
We're very very sad this day as humankind lost one of its greatest tech  soldier and visionary leader - Steve Jobs. It is because of him, I grew  the affinity to bring work home and work on mac and listen to ipod - it  has truly  been a generational, cultural and social shift - all because  of his genius!  May your soul rest in peace!&nbsp;
After even the brightest bulb burns out, in time, our eyes will grow accustomed to its absence, but never will we forget its brilliance; We remember fondly what its light once let us see. 
You Changed My Life, Good Bless You.&nbsp;
I am a Chinese, its hard to get apple products since there was just 1 apple store within whole country. I always read news from apple, and finally I got a ipod when I traveled to Hongkong. I hold the ipod, feeling like hold something in the future. I don’t know when I started to believe all the apple products come from the future, but I deeply believe that. I think Steve is an amazing man, he just made the products that all others were dreaming about, even not in the dream. He said to one ceo:” come with me and we change the world.” Although the ceo didn’t, he did. He said that then he did it. I even fear to say that.  Every time he showed up, he brought the perfect products to the world, I rather call them arts. Look things around me, Macbook, iPod, iPhone3g 3gs, 4, iPad 1,2. I used to have these, now I am very sad, cause the man who brought these to me left this world.  I believe he can change the world up there as well. 
 I want to share my condolence to the family, friends and peoples who worked for Steve Jobs.   He was a great man who maked the earth better with iMacs, iPod, iPad, and iPhone. I know he was sick, and was suffered from cancer, but now he is a better place with no suffering.   Life going on!
I would fantasize about meeting Mr. Jobs, or even better, working for him. His products changed my life -- starting with the Apple Newton, followed by the iPod and then the iPhone. (I have every version made.) His products elicited the same response of "WOW" every time I opened the box.   Thank you Steve for changing the digital world and for inspiring me.
Steve Job has inspired me to look  at life very differently than what I used to look at it. His lecture at Stanford University shook me more than anything else in my life. His words "Stay Hungry, Stay Stupid" helped me to take up things that I never would in my life. He has a unique way of looking and shaping the things and world. He is a genius.  
He changed my life by giving me more to dream about, and to look forward  to for the future.  What a Man! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
We are really sad for the loss of one of our examples not only in business and vision, but in life.  Honors and Glory to Steve.
I didn't know him personally but I loved what he accomplished and his memory  will live with me forever. Every time I turn on my Mac Book Pro, I will feel  his energy. RIP Mr. Jobs. 
I have made mention so many times that Steve Jobs is my hero. So much so, when my husband gives me the latest and greatest iGadget, he signs the card, " from your hero!" I never had the honor of meeting Mr. Jobs personally, but he changed my world in a profound way and I will forever be grateful. May he rest peacefully knowing he made a difference in this world and left it a better place than when he found it.
Dear steve, My heart goes out to you, you have been great inspiration to me I will never  forget you we will meet again Love always
R.I.P Steve. You were a true visionary and did so much for this world,  things that some can only dream to do. My condolences to your family.
If I could only use a single word to describe you Steve it would be "elegant"! I fear that the world will not see your light again. So long Steve.
History shows that every now and then, a truly great mind comes along and changes things for the better. I never met Steve, but he had a great impact on my life. I'm thankful that I lived during his lifetime and was witness to the splendid inventions he inspired. R.I.P.
Steve Jobs gave the world a huge dream, he raised the standards of quality as high it can get. He was indeed a creative and inspiring person.&nbsp;
 We are all fans of his products, we all fans of Steve and his products had a big lost when we knew about his death, i have a big part of my heart suffering along with his family, friends and co-workers. Well when I knew about his death in a colombian tv channel at the news programme I shivered when I saw about his death.  Thank You Steve for the changes you made in the world with your products, and my heart is with Apple and his family.
Such a very sad day for us all as we have lost a loved one. Steve had a magical way of making "believe" again and that anything is possible. As in his "Think Different" campaign commercial "The Crazy Ones", Steve will forever be known as the man who changed the world! He will forever be missed and always live on within the hearts of so many that he has directly inspired. God Bless Steve Jobs.
je suis triste, c'tait un grand homme. 
I have a sadness in the pit of my stomach.  I never knew Steve and have not used many of his products although I appreciate their style and ease of use. No-the world has lost a visionary and that is very sad.  56 is too young for any man to die but this becomes a tragedy when that man contributed so much to society.  We will miss his infectious will to create not only superior products but a superior experience.     His vision remains-hopefully it will inspire and new generation of inspired thinkers ready to reshape their our world.
Dear All, He changed the way we live.   He's connected us in the best of ways. He's made life so pleasurable--work so pleasurable through all he has created. He is an inspiration.  Thanks to Steve.&nbsp;
 The day I knew I wanted to be a designer, that day was when I had an iMac in front of me for the first time. Thank you Steve. You changed my world.                
I send my condolences to Steve's friends and family. May the sprit of  god be with them in this time of need. He was truly a visionary man and  will forever be missed.
He was a great man and will be greatly missed. He left his mark on this  planet. God Bless. 
The world as we know it, Life would not be any were near the same if it weren't for steve Jobs. I will pray for him and his family may he rest in peace. 
My first computer was an Apple IIc.  It's hard for me to recall a time when an Apple device of some sort was not a part of my life.  Steve Jobs was a true American original, up there in the Pantheon with Whitney, Edison, Ford, and the rest.  God bless you, Mr. Jobs!
I'm a creative at one of the London's Apple Store, Steve Jobs has been one of my heroes for his visionary thoughts and the way he conveyed his forward looking mind into technology giving us the possibility to use these amazing devices and computers.  I will always remember your words, I will always quote you and I will always enjoy working for the company you have created, rest in peace.
You gave the world everything you had&nbsp;and you left something behind that can be enjoyed, not many people can say that.  
El mundo ha perdido a uno de sus mas grandes genios!!!&nbsp;
Steve,  You changed my life. I only wish I'd listened to you sooner.  Thanks for everything. &nbsp;
To the man who showed me that there is a better way than Windows,  You were a visionary who will be sorely missed. Your innovation and desire to make a product that was not only useful, but just worked and was fun to use changed my life. I hope that you will rest knowing that you touched so many lives an made them better.&nbsp;
Today, humankind lost one of his greatest visionaries. Everyday,   people will carry on his vision. Someday, his Apple will be carried   everywhere.  Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You were a great person! Thank you for your gifts and inspiration to us all!&nbsp;
Your 3 stories about connecting the dots, about love and loss, and about death has been and will be my source of inspiration and courage. Thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You, and everyone at Apple, genuinely made my home-life and my work-life easier. Hundreds of potentially-wasted hours have been better spent. Also, thanks to you and a lot of talented people, my phone is also a guitar tuner.   I owe you more than one.
 Dear Apple,  I can't imagine there's anything left unsaid, but I would like to express my compassion and offer my sincere condolences to the friends, family and people close to Steve Jobs over this tremendous loss. He will be missed through-out the world, by millions of people who's lives he has changed forever. There will truly never be another man like him. May you rest in peace, Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Thank you for the innovation and empowering people is what you have accomplished. You made a difference in our lives and in my children’s lives.
I admired Steve Jobs for his creativity, energy and tenacity.  What a wonderful and rich legacy he left us all.  Truly a visionary. 
We've lost one of our greatest entrepreneurs and innovators. So appreciative for all that he shared to inspire and move us forward. Rest in peace. 
I have an iPod shuffle, an iPod Nano (2), and iPad, an iPhone (2), an iMac, and a Macbook. I consider these technologies as natural extensions of my sentience. Needless to say, Steve Jobs changed the way that I experience my life. RIP, Steve. Your life made a difference.
You were a technological genius, and I love your products. You have  influenced the entire world, and I hope you rest in peace. 
Steve brought music into my life. He made a difference in the lives of millions like me. He made a difference in the world...  R.I.P. Steve 
It is a testament to Steve Jobs' strength and sheer will that he continued to introduce new products despite what had to have been incredible pain and difficulty.    
What this man was made of, we will never know what he was thinking of for the future years. Thank you Steve for you and the wonderful world of Apple, love it! You will be missed!
Farewell Steve. Will remember to "Stay hungry, stay foolish".  Apple will not be the same without you.
 One of the most incredible visionary minds of our time. My life is more enriched because of the products he envisioned and designed.
When Apple computers were released years ago, my Papa was an instant supporter and fan. He taught me from a very young age to use Apples, and has always jumped to get the "latest and greatest" of their creations. You will never meet another 73 year old more in love with Apple! Steve Jobs was the most amazing creator of our time. He has inspired so many to follow their own dreams. He has taught me that nothing is unobtainable. Thank you, Steve, for everything. May God bless those in their time of mourning.  
I cannot believe he is gone.... When I heard the news I felt if they were telling me someone really close had died. I feel him in every gadget I have..... I have tears in my eyes. I hope he shared and left his wisdom all over the company and that all of you at Apple keep being as inspired and visionary as he was. Rest in Peace Steve. 
What can we add? Steve was unique and there will be no other like him again.
You can define modern people as Apple users and others.  He had an  enormous effect on how we learn, entertain ourselves, communicate and  think.  Yes, think.  He fought his last fight with quiet dignity while  we all waited anxiously, hoping for the best.  He was taken far too  early.  I am deeply saddened. 
I have never owned an Apple product but I will miss Steve Jobs. He forever changed the media universe and has had impacts on businesses across the world. It would be an understatement to say that the world as we know it wouldn't have been the same without him. I can't imagine what it would be like to walk down the street and not come across someone using an iPod. The world has lost a great person.
I extend my personal condolences in regards to the passing of Steve Jobs. To  me, he was a great idol and one of many sources of inspiration. Although I may have not known him personally, I was very motivated in my computer work because of him. I have faith in the future of Apple and know his last acts were done with reason and trust. Apple has a bright future on the other side of this tragic loss.&nbsp;
Steve, you didn’t die. You just moved to a higher plan.
you have truly changed the way my family computes, although my father  will say he was Apple from the beginning. I just thought it was fitting  that i received the news via iPhone notification. Cheers Steve, your ideas will permeate society for decades to come. My  prayers are with your family.
Steve Jobs,  You have managed to not only influence, but change the world of technology, and the way technology works in the real world around us. Your products have touched us all, with their glimmering looks, as well as their magical, intuitive interfaces. Many people don't see Apple as a company; they see it as a place where dreams are only right around the corner. Dreams that can fit in our pocket and enlighten us all with a revitalizing new way of doing ordinary tasks, and make our lives more fun and enjoyable for all of us. It is amazing what a person can accomplish and contribute to the world, when they truly love what they do.
Hello, I was so shocked to hear the news that Mr. Jobs died. The world has lost a great human being. I was inspired by Mr. Jobs as were millions of other people. I offer my condolences to Mr. Jobs, his family, and the whole Apple family. May Mr. Jobs rest in peace. He will be greatly missed.
It is with deep regret we announce his death. I'm so sorry. I will remember Steve Jobs FOREVER!!!!! I love you. thank U. 
I send my condolences to Steve's family, I wish Apple will continue its  journey in his spirit and vision. May you rest in peace knowing you did so much for so many and helped us  grow into a truly magical world of Apple as you visioned it.
I was not lucky enough to meet Steve Jobs in person but all I know is that this world most definitely would not be the same. Even though what he designed were only "technology gadgets" they have put numerous smiles on people's faces. From a one-year old who likes to doodle on the iPad to a college student who can't live without their Apple product to a CEO of a company whom relies extensively on what Steve created. This is a sad day because we have lost one of the greats, a modern day genius. My condolences go out to his wife and family. He's no longer with us but he will never be forgotten. what he created was nothing short of revolutionary and touched many people's lives, just comes to show what one person is able to achieve in a lifetime. Rest in peace Steve. &nbsp;
I have been an Apple fan since 1984. Watching Steve's rise, fall and greater rise was wondrous. Even Steve's failures were simply too far ahead of their time. His attention to detail, elegance, quality and the aesthetic have been greatly appreciated.  It is with great sadness and grief that we mark Steve's passing. I offer my sincere condolences to Steve's family and friends.  The world has lost a visionary genius.&nbsp;
He really inspired me and all of his apple projects, his thoughts about  life, rest in peace!  
He was a visionary person who changed things, a true Wizard. May his memory be honored.  Last but not least, may Apple keep, on his impulse, inventing future.  Tonight, there is an eclipse in my heart.  
A great man has gone, but he will live forever in our hearts. Ciao Steve, have a nice trip, wherever you are. And make it a better  place, as you did to our world.
We have lost another magic. Thank you Steve, from my deepest thoughts.&nbsp;
A brilliant mind and true visionary.  Steve will be truly missed from a fan who has viewed him as this generation's leader toward a future that we have only dreamed of. My hope is for Apple to continue its drive towards the very same vision that Steve had worked so hard to achieve.  May all that believed in, continue to believe in, the impact that Steve Jobs  has had on our lives over the past three decades. May Apple continue to strive towards Steve's vision in his memory. I truly believe that our world would not have achieved the technological advances had it not been for Steve's vision.  May his family know that I give to them, with sincerest respect, my condolences.  The world will remember where they were the day that Steve passed away.  His legacy will live on because it has to.
   Steve Jobs was a genius!  The admired like no other.   Will be missed!            
The world is a better place because of Steve! I can't even imagine what the world would have been like without Steve Jobs and His visionary Apple Computer! Steve you will be dearly missed, rest in peace my friend! 
A very sad day.. I always looked forward to what you and your team would come up with next. I grew up on  Apple products from the beginning, they are the cornerstone of  my career.  You will be missed very much!&nbsp;
I am devastated about your passing Steve ! You made my life exciting and intelligent. No one can replace you ! 
I never met Steve Jobs. Yet, somehow, even though I'm a mere 14 years old, he managed to change my life completely. Every single release of a device left me captivated, wanting more. The world will miss you Steve Jobs. You have a special place in our hearts.  Thank you for everything Steve.
There wouldn't be smartphones in this world if it wasn't for Mr. Jobs. The word app would just have been some archaic term. The innovations that became available only through a Mac wouldn't have existed with out you Mr. Jobs. Though I lie on the competitive side, no one can deny the innovation and possibilities you made possible through Apple.  I pray for peace, comfort, and strength for the family and loved ones of Steve Jobs. RIP Steve Jobs, you will be missed.
Thank you Steve for all devices, all night I didnt sleep reading rumors and watching your keynotes again and again. Thank you for historical quotes and magnificent devices that changed me, my life and people around me. Thank you once again.
Steve, You have created a global comunity strongly conected to the most amazing end-users machines ever builted by the humanity. We love all the Apple creations and we strongly love you.  God bless you and thanks for your existence in our lives.  A lot of light in your new journey, our eternous mentor.
Steve Jobs imagined a faster, easier, more innovative future and made it possible for the rest of us! May your inspired company live on to honor your memory.
My condolences and respect from Puerto Rico 
Words cannot express this tremendous loss.  May you rest in peace.
This is a very sad day, not only for Apple fans, but for the world itself. It's not often that such a true visionary comes into this world and is able to change so many lives. He will be missed by everyone whether it's as a co-worker, family man, mentor or true artist. RIP Steve.&nbsp;
His spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple. How profound, and how true that the Thomas Edison of our time was named "Steve" and that his genius  lives on through all of us that understood just how profound his impact would have on mankind, We will miss you Steve. God bless you for being you!&nbsp;
Hello, although I do not know Steve Jobs personally I would like to express my sincere condolences. Apple and Steve have deeply touched my life and how I live in it. Ever since my first Mac I became fascinated with the company and would from then on watch every keynote. I would love to watch Steve's passion, excitement, and love for his work. It really showed. I want to let you know that Steve Jobs is in my thoughts and prayers and hope the best for Apple.
May God comfort all the friends and family of Steve.  He has truly left  a brilliant legacy. 
the world is a little emptier without him…
Our geek soldier has left us with a broken heart. He was truly an inspiring person for everyone in our world.&nbsp;
One of the biggest men has gone ... but his wonderful job stay... where ever you are THANK YOU ....   
I did not know Mr. Jobs, but  I knew of him through the media, and  through family and friends who owned apple technology products.  I have  always been impressed with his genius,  his dedication to his work, and  his enthusiasm for what he did.&nbsp;
I'm 17 years old and I'm from Brazil. I was a big fan of Jobs and. I belive the tecnology would not be the same without him.   He revolutionized the computer science and technology!  He was a big man ,a genius and a hero and will stay forever in history !  God bless! And he rest in peace seeing that all he created!             Thanks for all Steve‏&nbsp;
 Rest in piece Steve Jobs I never knew or met you but i know you were an amazing human being and created some pretty awesome things that i use in my daily life. You will never be forgotten but hopefully you're at a better place now&nbsp;:(
Thank you Steve for the brilliant products that you helped to invent. You'll  be missed.
 Thank you.&nbsp;
Dear Apple Friends, I am truly saddened at this news. My thoughts and prayers go out to Steve's Family, friends and co workers. I can honestly say that the addition of the products that I now use everyday are because of Steve's innovation, vision and uncanny ability to know what people want, and how to give that to them. I sit here in my office writing this note on my iMac, and I am surrounded by about 10 other Apple products, that i use everyday and have made my life easier, more focused and enjoyable. His impact on my musical life alone, are immeasurable, and for that i am truly appreciative. I never had the pleasure to know him personally, but consider him a friend, as i'm sure many do!! May you rest in peace and may your loved ones forever carry your spirit with them. Steve will be missed by me and millions of other people who's lives he touched in a similar way.
Never met him nor worked nor my friend but very very sad. This is the   kind of individual that should remain among us for more years. Loyal   Apple supporter to the end of my life. Thank you very much Steve   Jobs !!! 
I never got to say thank you. I never got to share how his products have  given me more time with my family and made life easier. I never got to  say how my nonverbal speech kids start vocaliizing because they love the  Ipad or how I can use the iphone and ipad to get my autistic kids to  stop having a meltdown. He made products that will revolutionize the way  we teach a generation of learners, disabled and nondisabled.  He made  devices accessible for everyone.  Thank You Steve and God Bless your  family in this time.&nbsp;
Hello,   I was just explaining to my 9 year old son why there is such a loss with Steve  Jobs dying.   The reality is there are so few people that have changed the world and made such  an extraordinary impact on the lives of millions and millions of people. Steve  Jobs represents a tsunami of pure genius that will resonate forever. Forever AND  ever.....yes, this is a tremendous loss and yet he has left behind a gift from  God. That gift being the fullest expression of one's true self.  I guess that  would be iGod.  ; )  Bless your soul Steven Paul Jobs.....for you have blessed ours.&nbsp;
he would not give me his autograph. the totality of what he has given is  unmeasurable. "1984" ."think different", and " the power to save the  world". and one more thing.....................his spirit will live on.&nbsp;
The computer industry is what is today thanks to him. He brought to the world his wonderful visionary business style, revolutionizing design and fuctionality with fascinating consumer products. I hope he is now creating new wonderful things in Paradise. I'd like to embrace every one in Apple.
 I hope my child studies and learns about Steve because he is an inspiration.&nbsp; It is funny how life is...someone was watching Steve and knew why it was important for him to share his knowledge at such a young age.&nbsp; His time was short but in many ways he lived several life times.&nbsp; He must have&nbsp;been a brave man, humerous and wise.&nbsp; I can only dream of what it would have been like to be his friend; to see him in action.   God Bless...there is another angel in heaven tonight!       
You were a  rare leader.  Gave me a lot of dreams. Thank you.&nbsp;
All I can say is this a great loss to the world. Thank You Steve for bringing me a greater love for technology and showing the world that simplicity in design is a recipe for perfect design. The future will owe you major credit! Thank You.
This evening, came home deeply saddened by news we all expected and yet,  for so many fans, dreaded.  We found our kids on their way to bed, but  our nine-year-old son asked for a five-minute reprieve so we might  listen to a piece of music he had just created for the first time on  GarageBand.  Steve Jobs is largely responsible for handing over the  freedom for so many, young and old, to build on their dreams.  The gift  of tools for creativity and innovation he has given our generation and  those to come are designed by his his own unique vision of heart, spirit  and mind combined. We are all grateful and forever in his debt.  Farewell on the journey  ahead our dear friend.
Those who witnessed the presentation of the introduction of the very first iphone can never forget the feeling of magic when Steve first swiped the screen in the public.  A tribute from the far east 
From Brazil, I just would like to wish the best for Apple and Jobs' family. We miss him already.  I bet a lot of people feel like me, like had lost a friend or a parent.  Good luck, guys, keep moving forward and rule the world.&nbsp;
Irreplaceable. Thank you for your Innovations.
  I'm too young to be able to say that I've seen Steve Jobs progress to where he is today, but I remember being four years old and playing inside the box that my dad's iMac came in. From that computer, to the one I'm in front of now, looking at my Mac, all I can think about is how Steve Jobs was so important in making Apple what it is today. Hearing he died was so upsetting. I saw a tweet that said it perfectly, "People like Steve Jobs are supposed to live forever". In a way, I think he will. He will live on through Apple.              
The world has lost a brilliant man who changed the technology world. From computers to Pixar animation, he has changed the face of technology. My deepest condolences for his family, his business partners and all the employees at Apple and Pixar.
In 1986, I wrote my thesis on a Mac and printed it on a Mac laser printer. As far as I know I was the first one at Cornell to do so. It caused quite a ruckus.  That machine taught me that good computers made you feel smart and empowered. They were tools that enabled greatness. I type this note on my brand new Macbook Pro.  I just received it yesterday.  Thank you Steve.  Thank you for making machines that were not merely functional.  Thank you for making machines that featured stunning usability. The tools of greatness.  Godspeed sir. You will be missed.
for your unwavering spirit, a true inspiration. Here's to following your dreams.  You are missed.&nbsp;
Everyone keeps using the word, but it's so appropriate: VISIONARY.  Steve Jobs was a true visionary and guided a company through the pursuit of perfection with their products, and their customer service.  The quality of Apple's products and service is unparalleled.  Apple is always looking to the future, and to me, Apple represents one of America's greatest ideals: success through innovation, ambition, and hard work.  My dad and I are total Apple geeks, always discussing the latest announcements,  gushing about how much we love our Apple products, and how "once you go Mac, you never go back."  And thanks to the innovation of Steve Jobs and his marvelous company, I was connected to my family and friends while away at college in a way that I never could have been before, and that's made all the difference in my life.  Thank you, Steve, for connecting families, friends, and the world.     Wishing all the best for his home family and his Apple family
Steve Jobs you will never be forgotten. May you rest in peace.
It just took him 56 years to change the world... One of the greatest men the  world have known has left us, but his legacy will live on. Imagine what he could have done with 57. Thank you Steve Jobs.
Steve,  You have truly change the world we live in, now its time to rest... 
Hello,   As an Apple user, developer and long time enthusiast. All I can say, is that we've all lost a genius and role model.   For many of us, looking to what Steve could see as a vision of future computing has become a habit.    I for one wish you all well at Apple. We the user base share your pain and loss, but trust that what he started will be still the guiding light for you all as you develop further.
I would just like to give my sincere apologies to the news of Steve Job’s passing, my thoughts are with his family at this sad time.  Steven Jobs was a genius and his vision and imagination were amazing, he maybe gone but will never be forgotten.
I am fortunate that I lived and continue to be amazed with some of the greatest products he helped Apple to bring out. In his memory I will buy an Apple iPhone. 
To the family that gave him up for us…  To the company that admitted the mistake…  To the billions that followed… To everyone who thought different…   Thank you.   We are all the better for having had him… even for so short a span.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs has been a large part of my life for years. Although I and nobody in my life has met him, my father has always spoken very highly of him. I express my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and coworkers. I am positive that even longer than Apple or even technology, all will remember Steve  Jobs for his innovation at such an young age and helping so many people along the way with jobs, experience, and even just the products themselves. I am right now typing this message on my iPad, which has helped me in more ways  than I can describe. The best physical gift I have ever received is my iPod  Classic that has made me love music once again. My thoughts and prayers are  with him tonight. God bless.&nbsp;
RIP steve.....sun of technologies has set down...he was great man...
For aiming to perfection and showing it to the masses.  Looking forward to reading about your life.
I am deeply saddened this evening when I went to check my apple site to see that steve Jobs had passed away. he was a truly remarkable Man with an ingenious mind and his love to make  life easier for everyone, I always looked forward to his  presentaions of the next new thing by apple it's because of him I own a iMac, 4 iPhones, 2 iPads,  3 itouches, i Haven't  turned my Gateway computer on since i purchased  my 1st mac ... My whole family is truly saddened by this and my heart go out to his family...  all I can say is Steve you Rocked this world with your presents ..   god bless 
You'll be missed, perhaps more than anyone who has passed in recent memory. Thanks!&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. There is a void without you and a continued inspiration of all that humans can aspire to.&nbsp;
He was just as important to civilisation as Eddison and Einstein if not more  important! Thoughts go out to the family. 
Thank you, Mr. Jobs.  You will be greatly missed by many people around the world. I want to say more, but find myself sad and at a loss for words.  You changed technology for me.&nbsp;
  Just adding into what I am certain is a torrent of people saying that it is  quite a sad day, and my prayers are going out to his family and friends.  The contributions he has made to technology have been felt by many and  appreciated by all, even if they don't realize it.   
Truly a devastating loss.  I am deeply saddened at the news of his passing, and will forever recognize the unmatchable impact he has had on our and our future's culture, both technological and popular.  Rest in peace. 
I am saddened by this news but he will be remembered for all the great  things he left us with. RIP Steve Jobs 
I'm deeply saddened to hear about this  great loss to the mankind.  I doubt we have replacements for this type of a visionary genius..? 
Steve Jobs lived a life without limits in his creative mind.   Thankfully, I can say, for not only myself; he was able to convince the  tie-wearing business slaves to break free and accomplish great things  with our heart first.  Thank You for your inspiration and innovation for a lifetime.
History will never forget you Steve 
Steve was an amazing icon and a truly inspiring individual who will be   missed.     
The world has truly lost an important dignitary, a sherpa into the wide world of what could be, a setter of trends, a man in black. Our hearts are with his immediate and extended family.&nbsp;
I have a copy of your speech given to Stanford graduates and I read it every now and then to remind myself of how short life really is.  From a person who had never graduated from college, you have taught the best and brightest graduates the best lessons in life.  Good bye Steve.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
Thanks for everything, Steve.  You touched my life and you were a giant  in your industry.  You will be missed.  My sincere condolences to the Jobs family.
So Sad. We will miss him immensely.
I wan't to write about my intense sadness on the passing of Steve Jobs.  I have been a Pc user for some years but I changed over to Mac about 5  years ago. In the recent past I have watched Steve's presentations and was totally  in awe of the man - the passion he felt, and was able to impart to the  viewers about the Mac product range was incredible. He was able to  market products that are "ground breakers" in the technology and AI  fields. He has made computers available to the world that truly reflect  the way that humans want to interact with technology - that make life  easier, more fun and  artistic. My sincere sympathy to Steve's family and his work colleges. Steve has  left one of the finest memories to mankind. I know his memory will live  on through the Mac products we have to date and the future products that  his fantastic team will release in the years ahead. God Bless you Steve.
One of the greatest myths of science and technology has passed away today. My, and the rest of the world, condolences.
I am deeply saddened by the news of Steve's passing. He was truly a   visionary in the field. He built an exceptional company that I have   been loyal to for many years. I hope his innovative legacy will live   on through the future of Apple.  Thank you Steve for following your dreams and bringing revolutionary   products to our homes. I know this is a tragic day for Steve's family   and loved ones, but it is also devastating to the Apple customers   (like myself) who took pride in the innovation of Apple products.
Dear Sirs,  This is probably the first time I get in contact with a company to send my condolences for the death of a person I never met.  I just want to say how much I admire Steve Jobs' work. The products Mr. Jobs  and Apple have developed  over the past years have changed the world. The way we listen to music, how we communicate, what products we use to create art and many other things will keep Mr. Jobs' fingerprint for many years.&nbsp;
Steve, you'll stay forever in our hearts. Remember. Love. Grieve.
I consider myself to be a big fan of Steve Jobs. I am only a teen but have been a fan since 6th grade when I got my first Apple product, the 3rd generation black 8GB iPod Nano. I even wrote an essay about him in 7th grade when my teacher told the class to write about someone we look up to. This was and still is my favorite essay. Today I am in high school and hoping to work at an Apple Store sometime next year. This day was raining and I was reading all  about the iPhone 4S when I went to the Apple homepage and saw Steve Jobs. I  then felt like I had just been shocked with thousands of bolts of lightning. I started having tears run down through my eyes while writing this realizing that I will never get to meet Steve Jobs in this world. It makes me very sad but I realize that he is still here alive and well. He is here through iPods and iPhones, iPads  and Macs, Pixar and Apple. I realize that these things would not be possible without him, for there is only one Steve Jobs.
 Steve Jobs was in many ways a modern Da Vinci, a real genius. he was the man behind the computer, ipod, smartphone, Tablet computer, itunes pixars and many other great things.  because of all this, he is in many ways the creator of the modern world. and this i would thanks him for
Sould go down in history with the likes of Einstein ,THOMAS  EDISON ,  BEN FRANKLIN , HENRY FORD. He will be missed by all.
For years I have wondered why manufacturers keep on making ugly designs for computers. Until the MAC came out, I knew it would change everything, form the way we look at computers and the way we live our life. Steve you have inspired generations to push beyond the borders and think literally out of the box.  Thank you.......  My sympathies go out to your family and friends.   Take care.
We have lost a true, creative genius. He made our world deliciously   better. 
I was reluctant to switch to Mac after years on a PC.  A few years later, a MAC desktop, a MAC book and an iPad, can't imagine my life without Steve Jobs' brilliant mind.
I did not know Steve Jobs personally but he has accomplished some truly  amazing things.  I wanted to pass my condolences on to his family and  friends, and everyone at Apple.  May he rest in peace. 
I'm so sad. Saw this message @3.40 CET via App. A man with vision is gone.    
Steve, thank you for all your ideas, visionary and power that you included when Apple was making new great products. Rest in peace!&nbsp;
Thank you for your remarkable contribution to this world and for  creating a universal platform for knowledge, communication, and LOVE.   Go in peace. 
To the visionary that took a small bite out of an apple and created that little dent in the universe. May the spirit of innovation live on long after you're gone, Mr. Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I am extremely broken, You were the greatest influence on my life and  will remain from the sky. Thanks for everything Steve Jobs 1955-2011.
Dear Steve  You didn't just create great products.You created the first truly pan-global consumer way of life. Apple Nation!  A thrilling place where many at the edge of mainstream could live and prosper.   Your badge is our badge! Proudly worn. Go well!&nbsp;
He changed the world and changed people's life style! He founded the Apple, and he created Macintosh I, Macintosh II and iPod, iMac, MacBPro,mini, iPhone, iPad. Everyone in the world like Apple products. Steve is an angel, he makes the world more beautiful, and better! In Chinese MicroBlog Sina-Weibo, there are many many wishes, and remembering in the website. Everyone heard this news in the morning, they felt heart-broken. Yes, Steve Jobs changed the world.&nbsp;
He had nothing to declare except his genius. RIP Steve
I am a freshman in college right now. I wanted to send my condolences to  the family. The world lost the Edison of our time today. May his soul  rest in peace and may God bless his family.
The world will miss you! RIP Steve Jobs and long live Apple!&nbsp;
   Dear Steve, I have wanted to meet you. A legend from my first byte. Chose a fruit for name, with knowledge of good and evil  Painted as a rogue. Betrayed by a friend. Seeking an answer. Yet destiny bade. Returned as a saviour, tendered the tree.  Spring returned. Summer came. Dreams came true. Back to the throne. Legend reborn. You are the one. Steve Jobs you will be missed. My condolences to your loved ones. Warmest Regards   
The World has lost one of greatest minds of now days... Steve thank you  for everything that you created and make our world better and easier.   You will remain soul of all modern gadgets. Rest in peace genius.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,&nbsp;<div>Steve jobs has created one of the most amazing companies in the world. Every day I am surrounded by his work, I spend more than half my day on Apple computers. For me Steve Jobs has been a role model. I always wished to be as succesful and amazing as he was. I wish you all the best.</div>
Truly a visionary who understood how people and technology worked better than anyone before.&nbsp;
THANKS STEVE !!!   THE WORLD LOST A GREAT VISIONARY MAN, A GENIUS EMPLOYEER AND MANGNFIC ENTREPRENEUR. PEACE !!!!
We lost him as a human being but he will stay forever in our thoughts.  RIP Steve. 
I had the pleasure to meet you in life, would be very happy to meet you the other side.  Condolences to his family. 
Steve,   You will be greatly missed. Your vision shaped my generation, made me who I am professionally and gave me the tools to make many of my dreams come true. I hope your vision remains intact in Apple and we continue enjoying your greatest inventions for the rest of our lives.   RIP&nbsp;
It's up to you at Apple to Please keep his legacy alive and up to the   entire world to remember his memory.  Honor his dedication for innovation!  Apple, Keep us amazed!  "stay hungry" - Steve Jobs&nbsp;
So sorry to hear of your passing Steve.   My heart sunk when my wife  told me.  You truly changed the world in so many ways.  God speed. 
What else can be said, other than thank you very much for everything.   You will be missed.&nbsp;
Simply, he made our world a better place.  --&nbsp;
Thank you. You will be missed by many and remembered by all.
The world would like to thank Steve for his contributions and wish him well for the future.  From now on, I will listen to your speech in Stanford in 2005 every morning and quote from your words to support my beliefs.  Have a nice trip, hero!  
Simply put, HE WAS AN AMAZING MAN! This is a great loss to the WORLD. His ideas will live on Forever. My condolences to the Apple Family.
Thank you for providing us the best technological products of the world.
So many few people in this world have made something really revolutionary about technology. I am very proud, because I’ve lived at same time of a human being it was party of this select group!  Good Bye Steve, and thank you! 
It's sad to say this! It's one information that nobody was expecting! Thanks for being my mentor and thanks for giving the world your "MAGIC". The world will be forever grateful to you! You will always be our iGenius!  Thanks!&nbsp;
I'm David, a former Apple employee and the time spent working at Apple was the best time of my life. Being a part of what Steve Jobs has passionately created, even in a very small role, was inspiring and has made me into the person I am today.  I owe Apple, and Steve Jobs a lot and he will be sorely mis sed by the world. Thank you&nbsp;
I am a 17 year old from India. I did not know Steve personally, and to be frank I became aware of him only when he released the iPod. However since then, Steven Paul Jobs has become the man I idolize, my guru, my role model, my Hero. Every time someone I know even tries to make an anti-Apple or Anti-Steve Jobs statement I'm automatically there to defend the greatest company and the greatest innovator. For me Steve was like a God. Every time he stepped onto the stage to make a keynote and release a product, everything else could wait, Steve was speaking. Sure, I never knew him personally, but I could feel a connection with him because I knew him so well from all the books and speeches, and I'm sure he knew me too because the moment I needed something like a new phone, or a tablet, he went and made one, not just any product, he made the best possible. If I go on I can write for hours, because in my eyes it is about the greatest man that lived.  R.I.P Steve 
Thanks to you, I enjoyed my life.&nbsp;
A giant in consumer products. He showed that money could be made in the technology arena while being user friendly and still catering to the geeks.&nbsp;
Words can not Express the Vision of a man who was light years ahead of  the pack, he was the Da Vinci of our time.  He was an artist who used  the whole word as Mural.  I am sure the ones that were closest to him  will not let his legacy die.  Rest in Peace Steve your innovations will  live forever!
 I never met Steve Jobs, but he created my ground,  he practically created all my things, he was my idol, he opened my mind, he is my inspiration, in life,  I will take his example for the rest of my life.
The world has lost one of the most visionary, creative, influential, technological, innovative caring and emblematic person today...We will remember him everywhere, whether we are working on our Mac computers, talking on our iPhones, listen to music on our iPod, reading books on our iPad or smiling and  laughing watching the Pixar movies.  He will be truly missed.
The world loss an inventor today.    I hope they are treating you well up there. 
To Steve Jobs for the many delights of owning Apples through the  years...what a pleasure it has been...warmest thoughts to his wife and  family and to the Apple Team...I'm so glad to have been a small part of  this wonderful ride by being an owner and admirer of such brilliant  invovations. &nbsp;
I'm a chinese boy,I think jobs is the most great man in this century. God want to own iPhone so jobs take iPhone to him.
My deepest condolences to the family of Steve Jobs for a wonderful man he was. I would like to say that he has forever changed the way we think of technology and innovation and Apple was his creation and forever live in memory of him. I was always impressed by the way he could stir up a crowd. He would make us believe in fantasies again. That we can always do better. I would like to say he is an icon my generation will never forget and one that will live on to the next. Thank you Steve Jobs R.I.P.
He truly was a visionary and one of the only business minded individuals who respected design, apple is a testament this respect.  I raise a glass to Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Hi Steve,     You're angel to Human beings and one day you'll back, I believe in it.&nbsp;
I am ardent follower of Steve jobs and his vision. My deepest condolences to  his friends and family. He will be remembered forever. Only a few people can make such an impact in common man's life. May your soul rest in peace mr.jobs.
Coming generations will have to wait who knows for how long for another legend!&nbsp;
We will all miss his influence on the world. This strikes particularly close to me, having known him, and worked in close proximity at NeXT Computer. His innovation, drive for excellence, and uncompromising belief in building something better than “good enough” will, I hope, continue to be the inspiration for Apple, and others.
Dear Jobs family and Apple Inc,  The world is more beautiful because of him.  That is Steve Jobs, a man who changed our lives even most do not realize that.   I only had my first Apple product, iMac, for less than half a year, and I could not tell you how much I love Apple and appreciate the joy and excitement that Apple brings me.  No matter how much I say, it could not represent my condolence for steve.  We love you Steve.        
You were the best and most visionary man of the last century and probably the 21st century. You are an inspiration to billions of people who want a better world. Rest in peace, my idol, Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Such sad news. I pray that he found the Lord before his death. In life  he was a man of infinite genius and the world is definitely a lot better  because of his existence. Thank you Steve for all you have done 
Truly an inspiring man.  My Condolences. 
May Steve Jobs rest in Peace. Such a loss.  
Without you, this world is a boring world, but He change the world and make it better. He changed my life, even all peoples lives. He made Apple into the most valuable company in the world. He changed the way movies are made, the way music are sold, the way stories are told, the way we interact with world around us. He helped us work, and gave us new ways to play.   Thank you.
R.I.P. Steve Jobs! I thank you for all the passion you have showed us and the amazing products that everyone can use today! You will be missed.
If its even possible for a company to have a soul, it was Steve Jobs and Apple. He will be remembered and sorely missed.   
 May you rest in peace, and may your soul be blessed. And may some of your vision, genius, and artistry rub unto us.  We love you and we love to what you have done to our world. In your 56 years, you accomplished what most people could not do in 560 years or even 1000 years.  Thank you!  
An inspiration for our generation!
Farewell Steve I don't think even you will know the impact of your passing. Thank you for the great contributions and visions that have made our world a better place to live in.&nbsp;
Thank you for creating the most amazing product of my lifetime. We will  truly miss you, and there will never be another Steve. Rest in peace. 
I am writing as an ordinary citizen who only knew Steve Jobs through his products... What a great vision and what a great, relentless and unapologetic  pursuit of his vision!!! My thoughts are with his family, friends and Apple employees. RIP Steve!&nbsp;
I love Apple products. I get great inspiration from your products. Good  job, Steve. Keep watching Apple.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve, for all. Your inspiration for me, is not imitated to the apple  products, you has inspired me as human, person and mentor. I only preserve those words that you once tell me.  STAY HUNGRY, STAY FOOLISH thanks Steve, you will always in my heart, in my life, everywhere. 
the biggest thing u did has been giving us the ability to believe in  ourselves! 
I have admired Steve Jobs my entire adult life.  I never had the  pleasure of meeting him.  But if I had, I would have thanked him for  changing the way we all live.&nbsp; Thanks to Steve Jobs, I was able to sail through college at 32 years old  &amp; and become a physical therapist assistant...my MacBook at my side the  entire time.&nbsp; As a dance teacher (my other career) who spent countless wasted dollars  on cds, I now only teach dance class with my IPod classic!  My sympathy goes out to all the family &amp; friends of this wonderful man.
Dear Steve,  I never thought to write an email to you like this! So sad .....  Hope you had rest in peace, we will always missing you .. always
I visited Apple one time as a part of SpinVox.  My take away from the campus was the quiet brilliance that you could   feel and the freedom it created.  I will never forget the experience and the products of Apple created   by Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Today the world lost a true visionary. An icon for several generations.  He will never be forgotten. 
To you Steve:  Thank you so very much for being a part of our lives. Your works and vision have become a great stepping stone in our such early Technological Age. You have honored everyone in the world in performing this great deed. You will be missed by all, you will be remembered forever.&nbsp;
Your vision was second to no one. RIP.
Steve was an ideologue who stood out from the first wave of the silicon valley brat pack. The last to get mentored from a generation that included Bob Noyce and Doug Englebart Steve shared his ideas and vision with the world. In his own words (from 2008) Apple became the place where art and science met as well as the place where commodified technologies became the manifestation  of his ideas.  In the end the ideas that shaped the technology have themselves begun to shape and spread ideas - a fitting tribute to a great thinker. 
It was the Apple IIe that got me started in programming when I was 12 (EARLY 80's). Thanks and goodbye, Steve.
Steve, THANK YOU!!!!! from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!!!! Thank  you for teaching me that there are no limits to inspiration, and  teaching me to live beyond set limits and realize there are no  boundaries. In having a dream of how you can affect the world. But most  of all  thank you for teaching me to have the faith to look back and  connect the dots, and learning to trust the future will do it all by  itself. A Leader and a Visionary, a man whom we should all aspire to be  like, you will be missed by many, you will be missed by me, but the  legacy you leave behind, to follow your dreams will live on forever,  inspiring people till the end of time. Rest Well, till we meet again.
 i dont really know what to say, steve was one of my role models. everything i know about public speaking and presenting if its on youtube or if it was standing up at university giving a presentation to my class mates, i looked at him and took notes. he was a genius. a GENIUS. i thank steve and you guys at apple for everything you have done to change this world. my life is submersed with apple products, im using this macbook air to type this. i use an ipod touch when i go running and i use my iphone everyday to keep in touch with friends and family. you have made technology desirable. thank you so much. rest in peace champ            
Steve changed the way we use machines. I am thankful for his vision of a world once called science fiction. It is real now. He is gone. Thank you!  
To Steve's family,&nbsp;<div>You are in my prayers as you grieve the loss of your husband and father. Steve forever changed my view of the world, when I heard about the struggles he went through in life and how he didn't let that affect his dreams and vision it encouraged me to not let my own dreams die just because life throws me a few curve balls. I will always be able grateful to Steve for more than his products, I'll be grateful for his life. God Bless! &nbsp;</div>
He has been an alchemist..the ones that FOUND his treasure; The true Inner treasure. He is a fighter,innovator and a role-model in many aspects of life.  I hope "death" would be the ending point of a life and the start of a better one for you steve, Rest in peace.
Mr. Jobs was certainly a visionary setting a bar for everyone in the tech industry to aspire to.  His guidance, leadership,  insistence on quality and focus on customer service set the company apart. Truly, he built a team for all to look towards.  I had one interaction with you through an email and was impressed that you would take the time to simply respond. You will be missed in the world, but your spirit and guidance will live on.  Rest in peace Mr. Jobs.
Steve,&nbsp;This is a sad day for America and the world for that matter.  You were  truly an innovator and your genius design and passion will live on.  May  you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Personally, I do not carry any "Apple" Device...but he has changed the landscape for personal devices and where the competition was caught sleeping.  All the Best to Apple.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for being a true visionary, most of which, we have yet to see,  Thanks you for hanging in there, biding you time, until those who wished to take what you created from you,  Thanks for bringing Apple from the brink of destruction,  Thanks for the Apple products to come!  You will be remembered!&nbsp;
I will miss you very greatly, it seems like only yesterday I saw you and aspired to someday be just like you. I loved your work with a passion, your vision has become a part of my daily life. From Macs to iPhones and iPads, I love it all, and I send my deepest condolences to your family...Thanks so much for everything that you've done. :(&nbsp;
My deepest condolences. He was one of the greats and it will be a long  time before we see anyone like him again. God bless.
You did what you loved... You had the courage to follow your heart and intuition... You Stayed Hungry and Foolish... You became one of the Greatest Visionaries of our time... and YOUR Legacy Will Live On Forever...   Rest In Peace Steve Jobs...&nbsp;
  Steve....thank you....for everything. 
 Rest in peace Steve Jobs My deepest condolences to his family.
The world is less user-friendly without Steve Jobs. His vision was to make it intuitive and effortless for us all to  communicate. He made it easier for people from age one to one hundred to  use his tools for connecting and enjoying and working and playing.
One of the reasons I am in the technology industry is because of Steve.  I will miss him.  Godspeed Steve.&nbsp;
Mr. Steve's death was a misfortune for the whole human race. This is a  man who has passion, strong willpower and an indomitable heart. As a  student, I admire him, and I felt sorrow for his death. A great role  model, good bye! 
So sad to hear about Steve Jobs passing. He was truly a brilliant and great innovator and has left a legacy with his technology that has changed the world. He will be greatly missed. This is sent with love from my iMac.
Thank you, Steve. You triggered my interest in beautiful typography. 
Farewell to an amazing man who changed the world in an amazing way.     I live half a world away and yet I'm inspired by Steve in more ways than I can imagine.      Thank you Steve!&nbsp;
My prayers are with you
Sun-Min and I never got to meet him, but we will miss Steve Jobs so very much. We built our entire company on a Mac and now run it almost completely on the iPhone. We are perpetually inspired by his passion and approach to life.
Thank you Steve, you changed a big part of my life... I'll never forget you...  Rest in Peace  Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. 
Never bothered to write Mr. Jobs and say thanks. My little tech  consulting business wouldn't exists if it wasn't for him. He and  everyone at Apple enrich my life every day, on more then one level. from  the work opportunities, to my enjoyment of the products, to new friends  at Apple retail.  Thanks for it all.&nbsp;
    I am a Chinese student who is studying in America now. Steve Jobs is always a model in my heart.  I want to be the one of excellent person like him. I feel sorrowful about he passed away. Someone said, Iphone4s  Iphone for steve. Maybe it is true. I know he is a very good leader in Apple. Thank you for Steve giving us so many fantastic products.               
Steve, thank you for helping the world think different. You were a shaper of our modern world and you will be missed. 
in the morning, i heard the terrible news. steven jobs,our dear friend and an amazing genius, closed his eyes forever. it is really heartbreaking. i live in China and i have never been in America  even i have never bought any product of APPLE. but i am a fan of steve jobs  for his talent, courage and his nice smile. He lives in my heart. i will never forget him. Thank you, steve!
My only hope is the Apple team and leaders will still have the vision  and talent to carry on what Steve has left them. It seems that the new  CEO and most of the top leadership have been with Steve for years; so  there is no excuse for a change of business philosophy or direction.  There are many competitors out there just waiting for any future   mistake that will take Apple down and let them keep making just adequate  equipment and software which is improved little by little over decades  instead of real innovations...Apple style. Let's hope the present management will uphold Steve's legacy and keep  Apple the front runner it is as well as giving us the best experience in  our digital lives that can be had.
I  am a huge fan of apple and steve job .i feel like someone from  my  family is gone . he seems like part of our family. 
Steve Jobs was an innovator and a true genius. He changed the way   individuals listen to music, surf the web and communicate with others.   He will truly be missed. My condolences goes out to his family during   this difficult time.  
Captain my Captain!  Your death wake me up.&nbsp;
Steve's vision and genius forever changed the world. Thoughts and  prayers to his friends, co-workers, and most importantly his family. He  will be missed. 
Thank you Mr. Jobs, my business has flourished because of you and your perseverance for the best product. I owe you my livelihood. Thank you. 
Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma – which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become.    I remember this statement very well. Particularly the line "And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition". Since I was recently given the oppurtunity to do so, I chose to open a unique gallery and put all my energy into my art. It's sort of strange that he died the day before my big opening. What's really funny is that my original major in college was computer animation, back when the Mac II was introduced. I've have always been a Steve Jobs follower and will continue to follow his beliefs.
God Bless Steve. God Bless Apple. &nbsp;Thank you Mr. Jobs for all you have done for mankind and myself.&nbsp;
We miss you Steve, thanks for create the perfection.  We remember you in your creations ipad, ipod, iphone, imac.  good bye Steve!! 
Thanks Steve!!!!  "live everyday as if its the last one"  I will never forget those words.   
I would like to thank you for all you inventions. As an artist, you gave me all sort of tools to create. You were yourself the ultimate artist.      
It was not the apple that lost Steve Jobs, was the world that has lost a genius! Steve Jobs today and always! &nbsp;
Mr.Jobs,       Thank you for bringing wonderful products and ideas into our world, you will be remembered. Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
My condolences to the family of Mr. Steve Jobs, though I never met him  in person he has and still are an inspiration to me, a visionary  for his insight.
  We have lost a great visionary for the 21st century you will be missed.&nbsp;
My first computer experience was in the 80s, and the first computer was an Apple laser, ie, a product of the mind of genius Steve. The technology industry lost a great icon. I am proud to have shared the dream of this incredible entrepreneur. Rest in peace. &nbsp;
Thank you Steve, for bringing joy and happiness to the lives of many.  Very sadly missed.&nbsp;
Grazie per tutto e per l'ispirazione che mi hai dato.   Thanks for everything and for the inspiration you gave me!&nbsp;
My Grandfather used to hang pictures in his office of people he admired. When I was younger, I always thought that was strange. Today though, I understand.  My thoughts are with Steve's family.
Steve, you will be forever a silent mentor to me.  You are a modern day prophet.  You changed the world.   Rest in eternal peace buddy.&nbsp;
Thanks for all that you accomplished.  My life is better for what you have done in the way of bringing useful technology into my life.   "IT JUST WORKS"
No words can describe what Steve Jobs has meant to me. If someone was to  define the life of Steve, you cannot do it in one word, in fact, you  couldn't even do it in a book. I know this letter probably will not make it far, but if it someone does  read this, I just want to say thank you. Apple has been apart of my  family, and I will continue to buy Apple products throughout my life. I  have no doubt that this remarkable company will excel, just like  Steve would have wanted it. Writing this email has been so tough for I do not know what to really  write. But as I am touching my fingers on this MacBook Pro, I am blessed  that Steve Jobs created this life for us.
Steve,  Thank you so much for everything you've done. My life would not be the same without you. You are my hero. You have changed modern technology in a way that no one else could have. You will live on forever in the hearts of all of your creations and those who use them.  You are a legend. I love you.&nbsp;
The world lost a great human being, without life as we know it would not be the same, it hurts that died so young, my condolences to the family.
I am sad that we have lost this amazing man. I am grateful for his genius and "taste" in wonderful Apple products and  service.  Apple's HIGH TOUCH service approach FEELS like the energy of  Steve Jobs.  No comparison to the support from Apple and other computers  companies.  I am learning more than ever. I never met him but I will miss him.  
Steve Jobs   was a remarkable human being - a spirit of incredible intellect and   creativity. He left the world a better, more inspired place in which   to live as well as a legacy to live up to.  I send warm healing energy to those close to him and a hope to all   that we can continue to uphold his legacy of an unwavering commitment   to excellence in all that we do.&nbsp;
I was 6 years old when my father bought me my first Apple computer: the Apple IIc. I wrote my thesis about Steve Jobs' managerial approaches on an iBook G4. I wished my mom happy birthday today via FaceTime, while I'm on my iPhone 4 and she is on an iPad I bought for her. I'm writing this email on my MacBook Pro.   He's improved life in ways unimaginable. The man is a legend. And I hope Apple continues his ingenious work by carrying his vision in everything they do.
I don't even know Mr Jobs but certainly know all  about him.  He has changed the world we live in today with his visions and  his talent and I for one would be lost without my computer, etc.  My 6 yr.  old grandson is a genius with the computer already.  My sympathy to his  family and to his Apple family on your loss and everyone remember how he changed  the world and the way we think. I'm grateful for him!
There are too  few visionary leaders in today's world which now has one less.
You are the Tom Edison of this era, and will forever be remembered.  Our lives are forever changed by your leadership and visions.  Truly a life gone too soon.
Steve,  I wanted to let you know how much you've changed my life over the years. You are such a great person driving momentous change into the world and making it truly better.  Thank you so much and keep up the great work.  
 The man. The legend! Steve Jobs live forever.
The world has lost a brilliant mind, but the bright ideas are immortal. Steve, rest in peace. 
I was walking around my apartment complex along with my sweet heart when  my friend called me to convey this bad news. I was deeply saddened  instantly. my heart felt heavy. may his soul rest in peace. 
How incredible it is that I, a 66 yr old grandmother, can send by my phone an email to say how sad I am that the genius who envisioned this incredible device has died.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is truly someone phenomenal. He has not only changed my life  directly, teaching me how to live my own, he has changed the lives of  billions around the world - Whether you're playing your favorite song on  your iPod, trying to complete that impossible level on Angry Birds,  surfing the net for information for your next term paper or spending an  evening watching a rerun of Toy Story on TV, this man has touched your  heart in one way or another. I still remembered telling my mother how much I wanted that iPod Mini  back in 2004, my first Apple product, where I told her it would change  how I listened to my music forever, allowing me to carry my entire music  library, my source of relaxation and enjoyment. Now, 7 years on and a  thousand more songs later, this iPod has not only changed how I listen  to music, but how I listen to my life. Thank you Steve, for having the privilege to say that I've lived in a  time of difference, imagination and hunger.
 thank you again for everything you did. we will miss you.
 The world has lost a great visionary today. we are saddened by this news.  But, Steve Jobs will  live in our memory forever. God bless his family.
He taught us to "Think Different", be creative and always be ourselves.  Fighting for what we love, always takes us as far as we're stronger to  keep fighting. Thanks to him, Apple made greatest things, and so will  make a lot more.
I was truly saddened to hear of your passing.  God speed Steve.  
Steve was just a Genius. One of the greatest men in the century. 
My condolences to the Jobs family.  I feel like I too have lost a family  member...my phone, computer, and other Apple devices are always with me.   Steve Jobs revolutionized our world.  I'm grateful for his life and he  will be forever missed.  My prayers and condolences to you all.  His  legacy will live on forever. 
I feel like I have lost a family member. Steve influenced my life and the way I do things. That is much more than I can say about most of my family. So yea, it feels like I lost a family member and someone who really mattered to me. I can only imagine how those who were close to him feel like now. My thoughts are with his family and friends.&nbsp;
You have made this world, a better world.  Thanks
Thank you Steve Jobs, THANK YOU. 
I was introduced to the world of Apple when I got my first iPod   classic. Now I own a complete line up of iPods plus a Mac. I remember when you said, "Design is not just what it looks like and   feels like. Design is how it works." It's the best description for   your products.  Steve, you have a holistic impact on me; you will forever be remembered. 
He was a visionary a great human,he change our lives, rest in peace the  world always remember  him. 
Steve's Friends and Family,  Thank you for allowing Steve to invent great products.  He changed my life and my business.  Enabled me to do things other companies in my line of work weren't doing.  He helped me by providing a great OS to run quickbooks on to keep track of my business.  Please continue to make us proud and so that I can oooo and ahhhh about every product announcement.  Thanks again for sharing your life with me.&nbsp;
 Thank you for inspiring me and make me believe that I can!&nbsp;
Dear Apple,&nbsp;  Steve was our Leonardo Davinci.&nbsp; He was incredible. I'm very sorry to hear this news. I send light and healing to his family. He will be missed. 
Steve Jobs shaped my childhood, and has given me the tools I need to  create as an adult. 
Thank you SO much for changing the world.  On my desk is an iPhone, a MacBook Air and an iMac.  P.S. and 2 iPods!&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs showed us all that your ideas and dreams can become brilliant, shining realities. May he truly rest in peace.
I never had the money to buy anything from Apple, I could only look and dream with those perfect designs and one thing that always made me think was how genius was the guy behind all that. Steve Jobs changed the world for my generation, I hope he rests in peace.  My condolences.
He is truly an icon that bring new technology to our world. A man that  speak for the future, inspired many people, and follow him. A legend  that no one will never forget.  My appreciation to you Steve Jobs R.I.P 
We will always remember you steve.... Those were the days when we would eagerly wait for the launch of any "Apple" product and spend sleepless nights outside the shop waiting to get hold of the newly launched apple product.  Steve...you have been an inspiring person and great human being as a whole..   Rest In Peace Sir Steve Jobs!...  Feels like the roots of the "Apple" tree has been uprooted.... :((((&nbsp;
Steve was the greatest man in the world. He didn't deserve to die at  this age. He will always be in everyones memory and heart. 
I'm six years older than Steve but my fondest memory of Apple was my very first Mac....the cube with the black and white screen and the limited software ...shortly thereafter I got the SE and WOW.... my world changed.  What a remarkable man HE IS!!!! the permanent way in which his genius has made my life easier and richer is his legacy.... You are the MAN......,&nbsp;
Steve Jobs didn't change modern technology. He defined modern  technology. I've never met Steve Jobs, but I feel close to him. His death affects me in an emotional way. I am shocked and saddened. I wish only the best upon his family. May the legacy of Steve Jobs last forever, and may Apple continue to  be the company that he intended it to be. Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
You will be missed god bless you R I P.
Although I never meant Steve Jobs, I feel as if I knew him.  My   emotions have come over me as if he was family.   And knowing that   such a great man has passed, leaves me deeply saddened.  I find some   comfort in knowing his legacy will forever be remembered.  But life on   this Earth just doesn't feel the same without him.  I'll miss you Steve.&nbsp;
Steve jobs was born the year another genius died, Einstein. His genius will be missed but hopefully the torch has passed on another genius. 
Steve changed my life and the lives of many hundred million people.  We'll miss you so much, Steve.  You made us dream a better world.&nbsp;
Steve - you inspired all of us, and you made things that were always  complicated seem so simple. Today, it is hard to imagine a world without  the solutions to problems, big and small, you helped create. Thank you.  May you rest in peace and your family know the real, human impact you  had on our family and so many others.
The world will miss you&nbsp;
You may have left your body but you have never left our world. You shared with the world the greatest gifts...innovations...knowledge.    
May you find piece and rest. You did so many great things with your life.  Rest in piece.&nbsp;
I very well may owe my career to Steve Jobs.  Thank you for your vision, your integrity, and your ambition.&nbsp;
Every generation has someone of vision that stands above the rest. We were fortunate enough to witness the genius of Mr. Jobs. My thoughts and prayers are with his family. Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs and thank you&nbsp;
Thank you Steve, for changing my life, as well as others.&nbsp;
Many people in our celebrity culture play at being visionaries, when their myopia is evident to all but them. The same will never be said about Steve Jobs. He was the ultimate visionary - seeing opportunity when others saw only failure, persevering when others saw only defeat, contributing to the world in ways that we will never be able to truly measure. Throughout his life, he modeled the behaviors that we should aspire to emulate. Jobs' star may have gone out today, but the light from that star will be visible for generations.     Rest with the peace that comes from knowing that you've left this life infinitely better than before you arrived in it, Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Jobs,  Thank you for my Mac! :,) 
This is to the greatest and most influential innovator and executive of  my generation.  Your brilliance will be forever seen and remembered by  the way you have revolutionized the tech industry. Mr. Jobs, you have changed the world for the better and we will forever  remember you.  We have truly lost an extraordinary human.  God bless and we'll be seeing you in another life rocking out to your  iPod.
"Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has an amazing human being. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and work with Steve have lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple."  Couldn't have said it better myself, always and forever my Hero and Idol. 
Thank you for your vision and your inspiration, Steve. Your speech at Stanford U will always be remembered as a spiritual source of inspiration. Your message of "Think Different" has become my motto in life. You are an icon as well as an inspiration! RIP, and my condolence goes out to the family.
Just heard the very sad news of Steve Job's passing. My sincere condolences go out to his wife and children....it's never easy when you lose a loved one.  Steve Job's was truly an amazing human being...His legacy will forever live  on. My prayers are with your family and may they find the strength during this very difficult time. My they find comfort in knowing that you have made an unforgettable imprint on our every day lives. Godspeed and may you RIP Steve...you will be missed, but never forgotten!
 Steve Jobs was a visionary. One could say that he led us to the modern world that we have here, with the iPods and the iPads and the iPhones that dominate our news industries every day. But he was also responsible for creating a computer. A computer that ended up revolutionizing the world as we know it. I'm just a kid, and I never had the chance to know Mr. Jobs personally, but it was clear that he put his heart into Apple and his soul into it, and that's what makes him an exceptional human being. In this, he is a legendary figure, (not was, because his contributions to the world will always be here) but at the same time, a regular guy like the rest of the world...doing what he loved. In that, I am sad that I never knew the man beyond his public image, but clearly he was always something more. A visionary, a regular guy, a fighter. All of these words are part of what is and always will be Steve Jobs. Millions of people enjoy his legacy and in that, we are but shadows underneath it. So I offer my condolences to his family and friends, and I hope you all feel just a little bit better after seeing this letter, made by this kid.               
 Thanks Steve / Merci Steve,  Ce fut une chance de connaitre votre vision de la vie.&nbsp;
As soon as I learned of Steve Job's death, the first thing I did was turn to my MacBook. It keeps me connected to what others out there are feeling, experiencing and wanting to say, and right now, that seems very, very important. I think that was part of what Steve wanted to accomplish for us all. And in his too short lifetime, he did. Because I can do this, right now, seamlessly, intuitively. He made it easy.&nbsp;I won't shut my laptop off tonight. It would seem sacrilegious.&nbsp;  Steve was Apple's core. God bless him. And God bless Apple. Our lives have been changed positively in so many uncountable, intrinsic ways, personally &amp; professionally. A standard was created for visionary leadership, creative genius, dedication to ingenuity&nbsp;and corporate guidance. Combined with an&nbsp;intuitive understanding&nbsp;and true appreciation for the valuable relationship between product, service, consumer and industry is an achievement no one else has ever has matched.&nbsp;  I think he understood life. I hope we all learn from him. I am only a consumer of Apple products, but I will miss him and truly mourn. My deepest condolences to his personal and professional family. He will be deeply missed.
Dear Apple Family,  The fabric of my life has ever been changed by the technology and  passion brought through the visions of Steve.  I've always been a bit different in how I view the world because of  those technological goggles of Jobs vision.  Different is good.&nbsp;
I can think of no other person who has changed the way we work, think and play as Steve Jobs did. He was a creative, computer and business genius. We're grateful for the brilliant things he was able to bring to fruition in his time on earth and know, if he'd had more time, there were more wonderful ideas to share and boundaries to push.&nbsp;
We all miss you at our house. Steve was our Hero.
My idol and idol of the world. Oh my god. All people will remember you so much over the world. You're a great hero of the world, Steve.&nbsp;
&nbsp;It is a sad day for the Industry since a well-known and highly-respected visionary leader has passed away today.   He will be always remembered as a pasionate man with brilliant ideas and a strong will.  Our most deep condolences to Apple, Steve’s family and friends.
Forever in our hearts...&nbsp;
*RIP, God Bless You &amp; Thanks
By co-founding Apple, he has revolutionised technology. He will be sorely missed. My thought go out to his family and friends.
Steve Jobs was truly an incredible and inspiring man, from his exuberant  youth and through his long and courageous struggle.  He created the  world of personal computers and through that, and other contributions of  his genius along the way, dramatically affected our daily lives for the  past few decades - and years to come.  We will surely miss him.&nbsp;
Family, Friends and the Apple Team-  I'm very impressed and moved on the impact that's happened on my life and the world around. Unfortunately, it takes the end of a cycle for the bindings to reveal itself.  Please, find a way for these words to reach someone, be it just one or the world.  Peace and humble gratitude. &nbsp;
Definitely a man that inspired me in many ways.  I will miss his  keynotes and his visionary leadership that took Apple from the garage to  the world.  Much love to his family during this difficult time.
                     I've always admired Steve Jobs. A visionary for sure. He and his     team consistently designed products in a way no one else could seem     to match. Farewell to the worthiest of adversaries, from an Android     fanboy.&nbsp;Also, I have a Mac Mini and am damn proud of it.&nbsp;     
Steve Jobs was an inspirational and legendary person. He will be greatly missed. May he rest in peace. I would like to extend my sincere condolences to his family and friends, and to everyone else who cared for him.&nbsp;
You passed too young. Sadly I lost my mother to the same ailment ! Our son is on the autistic spectrum and you singlehandedly with your wonderful minds at apple brought joy to us as parents when we saw our son interact so actively with his iPad. Thank you sir for having been a part of our life! RIP
bye steve... bye the real apple ceo... bye the innovator... bye the genius... hope the best for you... 
Just wanna express my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.  I am a fan of his work for some years and always appreciated his creations and capacity for innovation.  All we, APPLE fans, lost a mentor.
Mr. Jobs, your products and ideas shape the world.  As a 14 year old, I was incredibly awed and excited at having my first Apple product. The sleekness of the design and functionality of my iPod filled me with joy, and I would have no qualms against boasting it to my friends.  My childhood was defined by technology, and by Apple. You have played a major role in my life; directly or indirectly is irrelevant. For that, I thank you.  May the Apple, a product of your genius, shine forever.&nbsp;
    You were the best man God has ever made. You are like the God of technology. When the first iPod came out I was amazed. The iPad was the best product I ever used in my very hands. I wish another man could appear today just like you. RIP my friend. we are all crying. good-bye. :*(            
Thanks to Steve Jobs, I have been allowed to thrive as an indie filmmaker.  I wrote my first screenplay on a Mac nearly 20 years ago.  My MacBook is reliable and stable and allows me to run budget, editing, and scheduling software effortlessly... and my new 27inch iMac allows me to enjoy the editing tools of Final Cut Pro, the sweet codec of Apple ProRes HQ, and it's great to use with other creative applications.  So much technology is at my fingertips without breaking the bank.  To put it simply, Steve liberated a new generation of creative people and allowed greater power to the masses.  My dreams became a reality thanks to Steve Jobs and Team Apple.  His influence on the planet and his positive effect on lives makes him truly one of the most important human beings of the century.  Thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
The iphone enabled non-techies and even old uncles and aunties in Singapore to search for information. It opened up a whole world for the not-so-brave and made life so much more colorful. We thank steve jobs for it.      I am inspired by his commitment and creativity to such wonderful work.&nbsp;
I did not know Steve personally. I have never had the chance. Yet I feel touched and profoundly sad today...  My deepest condolences and my most sincere sympathy to his family.  May he rest in peace
It is with deep sadness that I listen to the news that Steve has died. Steve was the dear friend I did not know personally. He was  to me the first of that group of unselfish techs. He was THE genius of the 20th century. Yes, there is something different about Steve, and he will live on. Condolence to his family.
I don't understand why I am so sad. I was told the news and I cried for  a long time. Why? Surely people who knew him and his family most  especially are the ones who deserve grief. Not me.  For some reason I cared for him even though I had no connection to him  other than enjoying his products. I grew up in an Apple reseller in  Australia, so as a boy I lived Apple. So I've always felt connected to  his vision, his dream. The children's theatre company I run I have  modelled on him and the way he ran Apple. Don't take any notice of what  the other guys are doing. Just do the best products you can. Make people  feel amazing, delight them with what you create. And demand high  standards from those working with you. We even modelled our advertising  after the Mac vs PC ads, comparing our shows with other companies shows!  And the odd thing, all day yesterday even though I did not know he was  dying, I was watching old keynotes on youtube of Steve. The one from  WWDC in 1997 before he became the iCEO. The 1998 one, a bunch of others.  Just had it on in the background for hours and hours whilst I worked and  ate.  Very strange.  I emailed him one time to talk about his disease and to look at the  emotional causes behind it. He of course went down the path of trying to  heal it on a physical level. And there's so much grief about losing him,  even though I know he's not gone forever. I'm not talking about heaven  or hell, I'm just saying he is alive in spirit and will have a whole new  journey in the spirit world.  I love you Steve. I will feel this for a long time, but I hope that your  next journey will bring such joy and adventure for you, as you discover  new things to create and be, and I hope we one day meet up again.  After all, it's best if we do not project our grief at him. Let him go,  let him be on his new path. I will do my best to quickly deal with the  grief, and lovingly from afar support his family to take whatever time  they need to do so too.  You are insanely great and we will definitely miss you.&nbsp;
 To the family, friends and co-workers of Steve Jobs,  May you all be comforted during this time of loss.  Mr. Jobs was truly  an amazing person. &nbsp;While I've never met him, he has helped me tremendously during my career  in software by truly being an inspiration.&nbsp;
La persona más importante en la tecnología estos últimos 10 años y la persona más admirada por mí estos últimos 3 años.  Recordar que vas a morir, es la mejor forma que conozco de evitar la trampa de pensar que tienes algo que perder.
 As I look at the words on the screen about the death of Steve Jobs, it looks so stark and feels so cold.  Crayola should make a rainbow colored crayon and name the color Steve Jobs as his influence and products inspired so many people to become vibrant, expressive, warm, and overflowing with ideas.  I hope his spirit remains at the core of Apple forever.  My condolences to his family.
No one gets to stay here forever. We are remembered by how we conducted ourselves, and what we left behind that can be shared by family, friends and the world. Steve, you left the world a better more exciting place. &nbsp;
Eu sempre tive a vontade de ter qualquer coisa da Apple nunca tive oportunidade nem o dinhero nescessario... Minha amiga realisou o meu segundo sonho de ganhar uma coisa da apple! me deu aquele adesivinho que vem junto dos iPods eu fiquei super feliz, meu primeiro sonho ja havia realizado pelo criador da maça! Fui informado da morte do todo moderoso por um grande amigo meu ele logo me ligou chorando dizendo que estava comovido não acreditei de primeira levou cerca de 2 minutos pra eu me conformar e começar a chorar junto ! E vim correndo desabafar! Jobs!
I just want to say that my thoughts go out to Steve's wife, children, other family members, and you, colleagues. Steve, thank you for creating those products I love so much and use every hour of the day. You've changed the world with Apple and you are one of the most amazing human beings that have ever lived. &nbsp;Rest in peace
He was a man that saw things other could not even dream of.  Thank you Steve for all you have and will continue to do for us.&nbsp;
Not knowing steve ... he still had an affect on my family, his &amp; his companies innovations gave the creative power back to us, and  away from the traditional computer heads. and made using our iPads, iPods, Macs ...... just FUN  His stanford address sits on my hard drive - and still has a powerful  message for anyone starting out, or continuing to live now  thanks steve 
20 years ago I bought my fist Apple laptop computer.    And thanks to the genius of Steve Jobs, I will always be an Apple owner.    Rest in peace Steve Jobs.   You will truly be missed.
I feel deeply sad when I heard the news today, even though I have never seen Steve in person. I wish our current stem cell therapy was mature enough to save him...  May he rest in peace,  knowing he is loved, by his family, friends, and also millions and millions of strangers in the world...&nbsp;
I never met Mr. Steve Jobs personally but he has been one of my role models and inspirations since I was a child. I have looked forward to every Apple keynote just to see his presentations. The world has lost a creative genius. My prayers go out to his family.
You have indeed put a dent on the universe......  Feel honored to just belong to the same period of Steve Jobs.  You have raised hopes and inspired many of us to wanting to do great things in life.  Your era is the golden era of design, golden era of technology, golden era of business, golden era of entrepreneurship, golden era of user experience, golden era of greatness.  RIP&nbsp;
I worked at Apple when Steve wasn't there, but met some incredibly gifted engineers that really understood the need to know the customer and make the products just work.  He left his imprint at Apple while he was gone for a decade and he'll leave a lasting imprint on the world.
We also mourn the loss of the innovator who has inspired the world. Steve is a genius and full of ideas, which have changed the way we look at technology in Indonesia and how Apple has changed our lifestyle.  Thanks for it all Steve. You're always in our hearts...&nbsp;
 I was born a geek. Steve Jobs made it cool. The world is better for having Steve Jobs.
So very sad and my heart goes out to his family. He will live on as the man who changed the way people communicate.          
Thank you very much. god bless you.
Your dreams helped shape the modern world and even though your body might have left us, your spirit remains in our hearts and minds. The world is a bit poorer today.&nbsp;
He was the man who attracted me to the computers. His keynotes taught me how beautiful computers can be. His interviews taught me how fundamental, strong and holistic a vision can be. He defined his own path. He followed it unyieldingly. He was the man who created the world of artful computing for us. He understood the system integration required to build insanely great products way ahead of time. He was a great believer. Great warrior. The only way we can honor his memories is by exploring his vision even further and make the computing artful, intuitive and integrated. He perfectly understood what tools the 'crazy ones' needed because he was one of them. I miss you Steve.&nbsp;
My grandfather was one of Steve's first customers. Apple has been in my blood since I was two years old and spent my days clacking away at my dad's new Mac. My grandfather died of cancer as well just 3 years ago. Now that Steve is dead I feel like all of my worlds mentors are gone. Nothing kept me moving  through life like the success of my grandfather and Steve, now that I'm almost seventeen and both my worlds idols are missing from the face of this earth. I'm not sure what to do.&nbsp;
thank you for making me able to love life, even  when nobody believes in you   and you are lonely  fighting  for an idea able to improve the life of everyone. thanks to you, now we all think different! 
For the inspiration, for making us dream, for having the courage to turn around a difficult situation more than once, you will always live in our hearts.  Will always remember you Steve. &nbsp;
Like millions of other people, I never knew Steve personally.  When I think of Apple, I think of Steve.  If I had to think of one word to describe him, "Brilliant." &nbsp;I was shocked to hear of his passing, and I had the feeling that I lost someone close to me, though that wasn¹t the case.  He built a great company and he saved a company and made it even Greater.  My heart goes out to his family, friends, and to all of his Apple family.  You will be missed Mr. Jobs.
When I open my macbook pro, iphone Internet connection, I find that this very sad news, I am sad. Steve I wish you happiness in heaven.&nbsp;
I'm not a computer person. And that is why Steve Jobs had such an impact on me. He made computing relevant to everyone. He made it possible for me to, not just use, but thrive using computers. He had the vision to take technology out of the tech bubble and apply it to the real world. Very few individuals have made such a direct impact on the world.  It is rare that an individual I have never met would have such an impact on me. My first computer at home was the 1984 Macintosh (I was born in 1986, we used that computer until I was in elementary school). I now have a 2011 MacBook Pro. When I was three, I was about as competent on that computer as my mother (except that I couldn't read and could only write gibberish). I used to type gibberish into some program on that computer and it would (attempt) to read it back to me. I now take videos on my iphone.  Thanks, Steve. for the knowledge, the discovery, and the fun.  And my condolences to those of you lucky enough to have had him as a boss, a mentor, a friend or a family member. 
I hope all of you remember him and keep going on the right path. Hug. 
Seems impossible that Steve Jobs is no longer making and shaking up  the world, not just computers but how we live. I love Apple - Mac girl  from the beginning and always will be. Many thoughts of comfort and love for his family and friends.
     I remember when iMac was coming out.I remember when Apple announced that it will not have a floppy drive.I remember watching the 3-step ad (there's no 3rd step).I remember when suddenly you can have a PC with colors other than beige and black. Revolutionary was an understatement. And it doesn't stop there.  It didn't stop here either. Salute to you, Steve.             
The world has lost a visionary, a genius, a great person. Long live his memory.&nbsp;
Steve has always been an inspiration to me, to work harder to better the world I live and work in. And he will continue to represent that in my life. In a way he'll live on through Apple, a company that is as much a part of him as he was of it.&nbsp; I hope that everybody at Apple will always remember what he stood for and continue to do things "the Steve way".&nbsp; Apple has changed my life in more ways than one, and Steve has inspired me along the way. I will forever remember Steve as the legendary leader of Apple who helped to give us a better future for technology.
It is hard to accept Steve's death. He put the world in our palms. We have lost yet another star and the last carrier of the American spirit of innovation. in these hard economic times he represented all that was great about America. He will be greatly missed.  Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. 
THANK YOU Steve for the happiness you created to our life. May God Bless you. We'll always remember you.&nbsp;
I never met Steve Jobs, but intuitive and intelligent are two words that  must describe him. His intelligent mind has benefited people's lives  around the world. I refuse to use a PC for the rest of my life, and I  love all my Apple products. My thoughts and prayers go out to the  friends and family of Steve Jobs. They should all be proud of the  wonderful legacy that he has left behind, and may he rest in peace. God  Bless. 
Thanks for your tiny wonderland called "Apple Store"&nbsp;
For creating such a wonderful world for people like me, dyslectic, utterly confused by all things technological. My first computer was a Mac, and it was an incredible feeling to work with a machine that was instinctive to use ­ allowing a person who struggles to read a sentence and make sense of it, an easy access into an otherwise closed world.  Thank you also for elegance and style. And for that incredible gift to create something I needed but was not aware of.   
WHAT A SAD DAY FOR THE WORLD!  WE HAVE LOST A TRUE TITAN.  BUT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO INSPIRE US ALL!!&nbsp;
Thanks for changing the tech world and inspiring forward thinkers everywhere.
    The loss of Steve Jobs is not just for Apple and the whole family is a loss for the world, he was a visionary, a builder, an example, a man who revolutionized the world, technology and history.     Rest in peace     Steve Jobs     Your legacy will be eternal for us            
You are forever woven into the fabric of our lives. Steve, thank you for your courage, leadership and inspiration. So we are left saddened today.  Very sad. Thoughts for all around you.&nbsp;
Thank you for the impact you made on our world. My thoughts and prayers are with the Jobs family.
Thank you, Steve, for evolution of human kind - viva la revolucion!
  Steve was a genius, a innovator, and also a good person, I will always remember him, the man who invent the Mac, the iphone,the ipod, and the ipad, and a lot of more things. I wished to meet with him, but unfortunately I will never can do it.  My sincere condolences to Steve Jobs’ family.
Thanks for all. Take a walk on the apple side of heaven!&nbsp;
Like a shooting star, you are gone at the top of your Apple Empire, may you rest in peace, you've given us a world no one can imagine before.
Thank you, Mr. Jobs. Your creativity and pursuit of excellence in each of your endeavors has inspired a generation of people. The world they live in and  the manners in which they interact, socialize, and work are forever better.  Rest in peace. 
Rest in peace GENIUS STEVE JOBS. You were an example to follow. You gave everything to your company, you never gave up on your dreams, you held on as long as possible. 56 is too young.. but your vision, your talent, your ambition has raised the bar for all of us. Stay foolish, stay hungry- your legacy will never die. 
Desde que conocí la vida de Steve quedé impactado. Hoy realmente me siento triste porque él siempre fue mi ejemplo de que vale la pena pensar diferente a los demás. Gracias por ser ese gran líder que tanto buscamos.
My condolences to all apple comunity and specially to all new generations, because the world lost a marvelous genius creator of new technology specially to make life more practical and on a way to create poetry with the products designed by apple company... Thank you steve Rest In Peace 
Although I did not know you personally, I felt as though you knew me.   What you did was  help me become more comfortable with technology by  keeping your products simple enough for me to understand and use.  You  kept me, the customer, in mind the entire time when developing and  designing your products.  And for this, I want to say thank you and you  will truly be missed! 
No comments.  Silence.
Dear Steve,   As I just found out that you have passed on, I could not bear the words upon the screen. Steve I want to thank you, thank you Steve. You and everyone else at Apple have created a Symbol in which the different strive and the bright shine. My generation will look on to the history of a great man, relative to Pluto and the great Albert Einstein. My only regret is that I never got the chance to meet you in person, and experience the wisdom and relationship you have created between art and technology.
God bless him. 
Never met Steve, but felt I knew him by proxy. He launched my second,  third and fourth careers. I'm simply overwhelmed by the tragic loss to  your family and close friends, and I truly wonder who will NeXT lead the  world with innovation and passion such as his.  May God bless your family in this time of sorrow.
Dear Steve,  I've learnt so much from you. R.I.P. Steve, I will never forget you.&nbsp;
In my name sent condolences to the family of this great computer genius. All we lost today but God is happy with the arrival of one of his sons.
Thank you Mr. Steve Jobs. You're a true visionary and you will be sorely missed. As I email you from my MacBook Pro, and my iPhone 4 is ringing, your legacy lives on through amazing tools that are revolutionary and bring people together all over the world.&nbsp; Much love.
Because of you I am able to get what is in my head out there.... You made the world a better place....  All the Best.
Thank you Mr. Jobs for your amazing contributions to the world of technology and society. You were a game changer. Always on the leading edge. May your vision live on in your team. Rest in peace.
 The most amazing person of my lifetime.  Thank you so much for bringing me the enjoyment of life, everyday.  You will be forever remembered and revered.   My condolences to your wife and family.
The world has lost a true leader - a man who genuinely made a difference  and transformed industries.  Thank you for all that you created - rest in peace.
Dear all  &nbsp; I'm a Apple fan in Taiwan and I regret to heard this bad news. He's so amazing. I use iPod, iPhone and iBook for many years and he could always surprise me by his new ideas. I'm really sad that we lost such a genius with the most innovative mind in the world and even in history. Sorry again, I hope he could rest in peace forever. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I own a MacBook Pro, an iPad, and an iPhone. My wife owns a MacBook Pro as well. Thank you for all that you did!&nbsp;   
Send all my sympathy to Apple and its employees, Steve was a great man who could not stand but his disease, praise the creator of one of the largest companies of all capable without my iPod Touch would not rest in peace, Steve Jobs, 1955-2011.  Greetings from Chile. &nbsp;
Hello, I am nine. I have a few things to say about the loss of Steve Jobs.  He was a very smart guy. He had lots of ideas for the new iPhone and other awesome tachnology. Many people will be missing his awesome, amazing creations. He is a creative, thoughtful very smart man. He will be deeply missed.
I have a been an Apple fan since 2007 when I bought my first Mac Book Pro. Steve Job's innovation and genius will sorely be missed. &nbsp;Thank you.
Steve will truly be missed. Your legacy will live on forever. Rest in perfect peace.
Just wanted to share our Condolences to the Family and Friends of Steve Jobs, the world has lost another Great Mind we will surely miss him.
Steve Jobs, the visionary, has given all of us square pegs, inspiration to change the world.&nbsp; Your legend will accelerate into the future and will take with it all the dreamers who will accomplish great things. Cancer may stop the body, but the soul will forever move on. Peace, love and beautiful memories to all who&nbsp;mourn him.
 Dear Mr. Jobs, You will be greatly missed, today we have a lost a true visionary, my family and I loved everything you created, we were obsessed with everything Apple. We will never forget your amazing talent, Rest in peace...and always smile. 
Steve,  You changed the world and made it a better place. I thank you for how those changes have made my life better and how your drive has inspired me to do the same.&nbsp;
I have known about you for a long time but did not until recently discover how immensely you have revolutionized technology and the world we live in. It hasn't been up to a month since I read a brief biography of yours and decided to put your name among my personal heroes. I am saddened by your death and I want you to know that the inspiration and motivation I have gleaned from your immense vision and drive would be with me forever.  Your very recent but strong fan.  Samuel
Steve Jobs was, is, and always will be my idol. I grew up with apple  products, and finally worked until I could afford a MacBook Pro. I  always look forward to see him present or introduce a product. Thank  you, Mr. Jobs. I may only be thirteen, but I know a great man when I see  one. I am sorry, Mrs. Jobs for the loss of your husband. I wish I got to  meet him. Thank you, Mr. Jobs for "A"s on my projects. Thank you for  inspiring me to be a great person. Mr. Jobs' death is a terrible event.  The world will miss you, Steve Jobs. 
I believe that Steve Jobs has inspired the world of technology. If it weren't for his great mind I wouldn't be sending this email from an iPad, or even a  tablet. There wouldn't be the smart phone as we know it today. We would all  be using phones with slide out keyboards. I am new as an apple fan (about 2  years now) and this is very saddening to me. I know Steve jobs would love to see apple do better that it did even when he was CEO and I'm sure this amazing company he built will do wonderful in its future days. R.I.P. Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Me siento triste pero se que vas a estar inventando muchas cosas en donde quiera que esteas, buen viaje y felices aventuras.&nbsp;
I bought my first computer while I was going to college to become a graphic designer in the mid 1990s. I looked over many machines to ponder which to buy. I looked at a PC and felt like I was all thumbs. I looked over a Mac and knew instantly what to do and discovered quickly all the magic this wondrous machine offered.   I bought my first Mac and never looked back.  I've turned down several job offers simply because those offices worked on PC's. What creative person would dare touch a PC and truly feel they were getting the best tool to perform creatively in a creatively driven business.  Thank you Steve Jobs... Thank you for challenging the world and truly making a difference.&nbsp;
I'm just an Apple customer but it seems like an entire generation just  lost one of their close friends. A person who has been a central part of  our technological lives. Rest peacefully Steve and thank you for helping  make the world work seamlessly.
I don't exactly know how to feel.  I've never met Jobs.  Yet I've never been so heavily effected by a death in this way. 
For those of us at the fringe fighting on the outside always looking in - Jobs represents what could be by thinking differently.
Dear Mr.Jobs,  It is unfortunate that my first ever email to you would come under such  sad circumstances and it does not feel right that i am typing it on a  product you created but it is your vision and creativity that is  allowing me to do so. You have left us in person but will always remain  with us in spirit. Your soul is imbibed in every iPod, iPad, iMac,  Macbook, iPhone and Apple TV that Apple has sold and therefore you remain  with all of us forever.  I thank you and celebrate along with billions across the world your life  Steve Jobs! May your soul rest in peace and we will always take with us  everywhere we go a part of  your soul.  Salut! &nbsp;
Like many Americans, I learned about the passing of Steve Jobs via a   device he pioneered... the "iPhone". And then, a few moments later I was alerted from my "iPad" (both   thanks via "push notifications" from news "apps".   Now I'm typing an email on my "MacBook Pro" while listening to music   from my "iTunes" account on my "iMac". I may want to put myself to   sleep with a game of solitaire on my "iPod Touch" or maybe watch Toy   Story via my "Apple TV" before I go to bed.  Thank you, Steve Jobs, for being such an innovative thinker.  Most people never even met you, but we knew you were one of the cools   ones.  iSad. &nbsp;
I am going to celebrate *your* life and how you made my life better Steve, in my memory for ever! iLOSS 
He was more than just an entrepreneur, he was an inspiration and a hero to many. I hope his ideal and innovative spirit will always live on in everything Apple touches. 
My best wishes and condolences to Mr. Jobs' family.  I can't claim to have known Steve personally, but through his inventions I feel like I've been touched by him. In our home, we wait for a new Apple device to be delivered as if it were Christmas. My wife and I get so much joy from unboxing what I really consider to be gifts, even though we pay for them.  I'm happy that such a great visionary was able to see his company succeed so well, after experiencing so many challenges along the way. At the same time I am very sad he lost his life so early. I've never had to hold back tears at the loss of a business leader before, but I think for everyone who felt they knew him through his innovations, we must all feel this way right now.  There is no doubt this man left the world a better place than he found it.  Thank You Mr. Jobs.
If you ever do read this, I send my condolences. Steve Jobs changed my  life when I was 7 and got my first Apple IIe. That machine changed my  life forever. I've been an HONEST loyal comrade of everything Mr. Jobs  put his mind too. He changed the way I think and interact with the  world. His attention to detail has never gone unnoticed in my eyes. Even  though I didn't know him, he's always been a big part of my life, so I  feel like i lost a friend and someone I can trust. He was the most  innovative person in the past 40 years. The world will never see someone  like Mr. Jobs again. I'm sorry for your loss, and my family grieves with  you.
Steve's innovations made me enjoy computing again.  I was proud to own a  Mac because of the all the work that Steve started. Your shoes will never be filled.
Today I shed tears as one of the most inspirational human being has  passed away. &nbsp;His speech to the graduating class of students was such a motivational  speech that I had my daughters watch it in its entirety.  Mr. Jobs, you may be gone but never forgotten by my generation or future  generations to come.  The utmost condolences for the Jobs family.
He was such an amazing man. The generations before or after ours will never see such a visionary. I'm truly, very sad that he's no longer with us. I wish he could have had a little more peace in his last years. 
His contribution to the improvement of the world through his innovation  in the high-tech world is no doubt extra-ordinary. He is one of the very  few and exemplary human being who led us to the modern world of  computing and in advancing a better and affordable lifestyle of so many  - young and old, rich or poor, at every continent, every culture,  through the many products that Apple has invented and made affordable to  so many. I do not know of any person today who has not used one of  Apple's products. 
I don't know exactly what to say. Thanks Steve for giving the world so   much. I am an avid Apple user and I will never stop using Apple   products. Its really unfortunate that you left us so soon. Your work   won't be forgotten. 
For the inspiration. For helping my realize my dreams with the help of apple products and for your inspiring vision on life. Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
I bought my two daughters iPads for Christmas this year.  They're gonna be real happy.  Couldn't have happened without Steve Jobs.  RIP Steve.&nbsp;
When I first came to the USA back in 1984, the first computer that I   learned how to program and do simple math on was an Apple 2C and the Apple  2E.   From then it only got bigger and better.  Steve gave IBM a run  for their  money.  Mac's where ahead of their time in graphics design  and sound.  It is  amazing what this one man accomplished in his  lifetime.  He will be missed.
He was The most genius in the world. And forever. I always miss you Steve jobs. You get my respect. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve,  You gave real big difference to letter "i". You are the man who really transformed the music, phone and computer  industry, the way we listen to music, we browse and call people. Your  speech given at Stanford  is truly inspiring.  We love you Jobs. May your soul rest in peace. 
Thank you to an amazing man who changed our world!!!  We will forever miss you and you will always be with us!  I thank you everyday for all that you have taught us and what you have showed us.  May your family and friends know how many lives you have changed and touched.  Rest in peace and much love to your family and friends.  
I was a total PC fan, and never understood Apple fans. Reading a bit  about what Steve was doing to Apple two years ago, I thought to myself  "There must be something I am missing, and as a teacher I need to  understand why some people are so fond of these machines". And it  started with an offer for an iMac. The seller told me "Once you start with this, there is no return. You  will not want to go back to a PC". How right he was! I am now mainly using Apple, only turning to a PC notebook due to me  teaching in that environment. Sad to have missed so many years of what  Steve had been producing together with all you Apple people.  He will certainly be missed, but definitly not forgotten. His legacy is  with you people. Make him proud.  WIth my deepest sympathy to all the Jobs family and the Apple family
Steve Jobs is a genius can change the world!&nbsp;
Thank you for giving me the tools that helped spark my creativity. Godspeed, Steve. 
Steve, you were the inspiration of my life. Thank you for letting us be a part of your extraordinary vision. I will miss you dearly. You will always be a  part of my life. My thoughts and prayers go out to your family. Rest in peace, Steve.
 Truly heartfelt condolences, May his soul rest in peace, may god be with his family. World just lost a great visionary person, who could change  how the technology could be applied practically for a day to day use.
A huge loss! Thank you Steve for everything you did for this world...
When i see my 2 years old daughter playing and learning with my iPod touch  I see Steve's vision and innovation reflected in this amazing device that only  he could have  built
Dear Steve,  Thank you for touching society with your brilliant visions and   innovation. From Woz's garage to having your inventions tucked in   hundreds of millions of pockets, in corners of the world people other   than yourself would never have imagined. You changed how we read   books, listen to music, and receive information.  You are one of the all-time greats on the Mt. Rushmore of innovation   along with Edison and Da Vinci. I will watch and listen to your   Stanford speech on one of your inventions when I am in need of   inspiration.  Thank you Steve. Rest in peace.
As a gamer, Steve Jobs has had a tremendous effect on my life.  From his work back in the day building blue boxes, to innovating again and again in everything he did to this day.  He will be missed. Thanks Steve for having a hand in making  me who I am, and for making things better for all of us. 
Thank you Steve, for all that you gave.
I just want to say Thank You Steve Jobs for making all our lives   better, you definitely were the most important visionary of our   time.... you will be missed.&nbsp;
Steven Jobs I never met you before but I feel I have in a life before  this one. Your thoughts and ideas have inspired me so much! you were an  absolutely amazing man and will be remember for years to come for your  hard work, ability to see the future, and dedication for Apple. You have  put Apple at astronomical levels, Apple is far more than what it used to  be. I will tell my children about you and the inspiration you have given  to me, and i just hope one day I'm successful as you were. Steve may  your body and soul now rest in peace and be free.
There may never be a human being as creative or driven as Steve. He helped reform the way we view technology in society. Before Steve a phone was just a phone. Now phones are far more than just devices to call other individuals by. Without Steve computers would not be where they are today on the consumer market if it were not for the Mac computer. Even at this moment I am typing on a Macbook Pro. We will all miss you and we all love you dearly. 
Thank you Steve, For all You gave me, and my kids, and all you gave to the world. And I don't just mean "The Hardware"  I do not regularly shed tears for people I do not know personally, but now, trough the tears, all I can say is: "Sayonara Steve...Sayonara...and THANKS"   From now on you will be an "Industry Standard" that everyone will be   mesured against.&nbsp;
 From our family to yours, please accept our sincere condolences.&nbsp;
Hey,  I just wanna thank you Apple and most of all Steve Jobs for connecting people and for all the inventions you made. He was a great man. Enjoy your life in heaven Mr. Jobs. &nbsp;
My life has been measurably changed since I watched Steve Jobs pitch the  Imac G5. Since then I thought of him as the steely dan who thought about  me in such a personal way that he designed a computer to meet all my  needs.  Last of the True Pioneers steve Jobs was.  My condolences to his family and friends 
Quiero decirles que el mundo es un lugar vacio por un día de nuevo ... Un gran hombre una gran mirada y una inigualable vision ... Doy mi apoyo a quienes siguen en su causa que aún apenas comienza ... gracias por mostrarnos un mundo que ni nos imaginabamos ... Larga vida Steve! A veces no es necesario conocer a las personas a veces solo basta una mirada para ver su espiritu.
    I'm from Lima - Peru, a college student of Communications. I would like to receive my most heartfelt condolences on the passing of Steve Jobs. Recently, in time for class, my teacher showed us a video that showed Mr. Jobs speaking at Stanford University, was from his own mouth that I found out he had overcome cancer, it is as if I had been introduced to a boy which was shocked by his genius and intelligence and I am sorry to hear that he died and that video I take it as a farewell because he knew he would die. I am touched. Rip Steve Jobs.            
Thank you for making the personal computer personal.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs I am what I am today, because my parents laid a solid foundation and you showed me the light! RIP my icon! Kind Regards&nbsp;
A sad sad day. Steve Jobs never to be forgotten.&nbsp;
World today had lost legendary one of a kind winner model Steve Jobs, A man with history that really inspired millions around the worlds and i am proud to be one of them....... may his soul rest in peace.
 I'm sorry. We will never forget him.
My thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and our Apple family! If wasn't for Steve, I wouldn't be where I am today, in a job that I love, with a big family who I love to see every day! So Steve thank you for more than just your creative inspirations, thank you for my family!
we all know the stories about the beginning, but I can say that I have worked with apple computers and everything else since 1983, and as I type this on my mac pro laptop, will continue to support the best computer company in the world! My father in law passed away from pancreatic cancer at the age of 39, so my condolences go to his family, knowing how devastating this disease is! Hopefully we can focus on a cure and better treatment for this cancer. God Bless his Family.
Thanks to Jobs, we have so many amazing Apple product in this world. Best wishes for you, our Steve Jobs.
Thanks Steve! 
I don't use the word hero very often, but Mr. Jobs was a true hero of mine.  His focus, his work ethic and most importantly his passion will always be a model for how to start, grow and run a business.  May God bless his soul and  his family that he leaves behind.&nbsp;
My 1st computer was an Apple 2e. Now I send a message of condolence to the friends, family and colleagues of a man who dreamed a bit bigger from a device that was beyond science fiction back when that 2e was new. Thank you Steve, you have changed the world.
It's a sad day but thank you for changing the world. Let's continue the dream.&nbsp;
For Steve You were a revolutionary pioneer who has changed my life for the better I own an iPod, iPhone, Macbook Pro and am buying the iPhone 4S. You made things simpler and have changed the world. You were a great gift given to us all and taken from us so suddenly, you  will be a legend and live on in my heart as a student currently studying  Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London who chose this path  thanks to your style and inspiring charisma. I will greatly miss your presence, it will never be the same. I hope  Apple will live on with your values and vision and will never forget how  you made it what it is today. A special man. R.I.P &nbsp;
Just a great man. We will miss you.
Mr. Jobs knew what people wanted, and he knew how to give it to them. He had the intelligence, the class, the passion, and the drive to make all of this happen, and it is reflected in his products one thousand percent.  I honestly hope that Mr. Jobs' legacy will continue forever. I hope that Apple executives will ask, "What would Steve do?" when they design new products, and I hope that this company will continue to make me a proud owner of all their products that I have, and agonizingly yearn for the ones that I don't.  "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want to change the world?"  Mr. Jobs, you are an inspiration to us all. 
I would like to offer all the employees at Apple my sincerest condolences.&nbsp;  Steve made me excited to be an Apple user.  I always have been and always will be loyal to the idea of making things simple.&nbsp;  Steve has inspired me to get to where I am today in the wireless industry.   Apple products make it possible for me to have my job today.  Without them  my job would still only be an idea.&nbsp;  Thank you for the gift of dreams Steve.
I am saddened by the loss of Steve. I did not know him personally but regard him as one of the great minds of our time. I'm sure history will show this.  My condolences to all his family and friends who feel his loss.&nbsp;
Please extend my heartfelt condolences to Mr. Jobs family.  How amazing  to have made such a positive impact on millions of people worldwide. 
Even though I did not know Steve personally, I was taken away with his  intelligence and inspiration.  When I saw his story on TV one day I was  very impressed with him.  I feel he was gentle spirit person also.  He  will truly be missed by the world.  I will keep his family in my  prayers.&nbsp;
 May you rest in peace&nbsp;
We as a nation have lost a teacher. A teacher who had infinite vision in modern technology, and taught us all to be visionaries. He taught me not to be afraid to explore hand held phones, computer tech, and ultimately he made technology " friendly user" . To all Apple team I send my deepest condolences.
My condolences to Steve Jobs' family, friends and colleagues.  His loss is a worldwide loss.  He was truly a man of vision and inspiration.  He changed the world as we know it today.  Saying thank you for all he has given us is an understatement.  Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.     From the heart.&nbsp;
Good bye Steve Jobs! You were one of the great person who I respect. You will be written in our history. I offer my highest respect to you. 
My condolences to Steve's family, the Apple family and all those who were blessed to have known him personally. He was an innovator and visionary beyond  compare and has truly changed our world. Rest in peace Steve. You will be missed.
Since the beginning of my career as a computer programmer, I used a Mac.  The functionality, beauty, and approach from your products has always inspired me to make applications that derived the same feeling.  The feeling of something just perfect, thoughtful, completely well made.  There are lots of words that can be used to convey this, but it's just a feeling.  I believe it's the vision that Steve had.  That is why Apple is so awesome and why people like me, will always look up to it.  Thank you, Steve.
 Steve Jobs...The best thing in modern history, a man who changed my life forever. R.I.P            
All I know is that my career, supporting my family, and the growth of my  creativity all stems from a magical box dreamed up my a man who knew of  no limits to his imagination. Thank you, Steve Jobs and happy travels to  your peaceful rest. 
I am very sad. Lose a great person like him. The idea of my designs was supported by your computers. Thank you very much!
  Steve Jobs made a difference, he was an innovator and a talented creative in so many ways - not least in the making of business decisions. We the users of Apple products felt as though a little of him belonged to us. He will be missed.                
Deeply memory the man who have been changing our world!!!&nbsp;
Just a cool dude that changed the world.  When Stevie Wonder mentions you, you have made it.  Rest in Peace.  
Dear Mr. Steve  "Many thoughts...,memories, and condolences".  Many thanks for your visionary! and creative!.&nbsp;
They all laughed.  But he knew what he was doing. We will all miss him.&nbsp;
  Employees of Apple you have big shoes to fill!!!  One of the greatest visionaries has passed away but I know he has passed on his skills and passions to everyone that has crossed his path.  Apple has grown to be much more than a person it is now a way of life.    Thank you, Steve Jobs for making my life so much easier with the technology you envisioned and masterminded.  My goal in business is to follow your example.         
The entire world will miss the genius that change the way we live, the way we look a telephone or the way we surf the web. He made technology something beautiful.  Rest in peace Steve.
I'm shocked and speechless.    This horrible news has popped up on my iphone just a quarter ago at 2:15 a.m. while I was watching one of the Steve's presentation on youtube looking for inspiration for my show tomorrow.   I always looked at him as a role model of innovation, great vision and passion.  I wish I could have met him :(.   Please accept my most sincere condolences on the loss of Steve
Very sad to hear of Steve's death. His impact on the world is profound. Sympathy to his family, friends and colleagues.
Thanks Steve for bringing us, the consumer, the most innovative technology over the years. R.I.P. Steve, my sincere condolence goes out to all the family.
I'm sure that this news saddened every one who read it. "Steve Jobs dies." The world lost a great genius. Steve Jobs changed the world, the tecnology is what it is today because him. He will be remembered for many generations.&nbsp;
  I started as a computer science student without any background  experience or knowledge in the matter. But one day I heard Steve Jobs  speech. He made me realize that anything is possible if you are  determined and not afraid to dream. Steve Jobs has changed the world  with his vision and genius. He will be always remembered and missed. I  wish this is not happening but sadly we have to accept God's will.  My condolences to his family and friends.
Thanx for changing the world i am blessed to be in this era to have ALL of your products. You will never be forgotten and your legacy will live on.
 The world has lost more than just an amazing human being today, they lost on e of the most brilliant visionaries since Thomas Edison, a man that with his  passion and ideas helped build a company with no suits and ties, amazing cu stomer service, and products with un matched quality. The world will never be the same.
 Thank you for your gift. Thank you for what you have done and will do for my  students. I teach students with autism who use iPads to communicate. Because of your product they can be part of the world they have always deserved to  be in. Your products has given them new life. I see it in their eyes. I know you will rest now and know that what you created will only open so many new avenues for them. Thank you for changing their world! As I write this on my iPad to you, Steve, a true legend.
It's a very big shame. I can't believe it... Steve Jobs, An amazing Man, is dead. A man who was fascinating me, and  so many people. An very genius. I really love this man. he was an icon for several  generations. I take the iPhone 4S like his last gift. I hope that Apple will survive and continue to give her best even while  continuing to live the spirit of Steve Jobs. I address All my condolences to the Jobs family  Good Luck Mister Tim Cook, Good Luck Apple, Good Luck at all the Apple's  team...  R.I.P. Mister Steven Paul Jobs, Forever My model.&nbsp;
Dear Apple, I'm so sad to hear of Steve Jobs' passing. I want to share some of my memories of watching the macintosh evolve over the years. As a kid, I used to go to Montgomery Wards and play with the Macintosh that was on display. The very first program was one where I could draw and use brushes (it was in the late 80s, early 90s), and was very impressed with it. Unfortunately, my family couldn't afford it at the time so I wen t to that same computer every time I visited the store until it was gone. &nbsp;Montgomery Ward closed completely in the late 90s and no other store carried an Apple product. I moved on to use the computers at school, but none  of them impressed me like that Macintosh did at Montgomery Ward. I didn't really think about having a computer of my own until I got to community college in 2006 (which made me a non traditional student). It was the end  of the fall semester when I found out that I could get a discount for a computer. I remembered that computer from Montgomery Ward and decided tha t my first computer would be an iMac. It took a couple of weeks and a cab  ride home (I don't have a car), I got it home. I also got an iPod Nano  2nd Generation a day before the new one came. They're still with me, eve n though the iMac got electrocuted and I had to replace the hard drive, and  I got iPod classic to make room for more songs, and a Macbook Pro to help  out with my new school. Thanks to you, I got my Associates and I'm a year away from getting my Bachelor Degree. I hope to pass these down when I  have my own family someday. Everyone will miss you Mr. Jobs, and know  that you made a lot of people's lives better. Ever since I saw that Macintosh at Montgomery Wards and that drawing program as a little girl, I knew  that I was going to buy an Apple computer. Thank you for everything.
iMac, iCards, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, iPad, iCloud, iMiss Steve!!!
Extraordinary person who's visionary changed the world for better. You were a Great Man. Thank you Steve. RIP.    
I could not imagine a 2011-world without iTunes, iPod, iPad or iPhone...&nbsp;
Dear whoever will read this,  Steve was the man, who changed my entire life. His willpower and  intelligence skills made me think different, think the way I should  think; in fact, most of aspects changed due to his ideas and his ability  to push idea to real life. There are lots of people like me, who you won't ever know or meet but  they won't be the same again.  Steve Jobs is a Man in history of humanity. Man with capital M. He will  always take special place in our hearts and mind. 
 Thanks... :(  
Certainly, the world has lost a genius and a wonderful human being.  I'm a web programmer and even when I've worked just few times with Apple products, I've been always inspired by the technological advances of this amazing company and by the vision of Steve Jobs.  For me it has been a great honor having lived in the same time that this great promoter and creator of most of the current computer technology, and I express my condolences for this lost.&nbsp;
Reflections on Steve Jobs:  It is difficult to quantify or fully express what Steve Jobs meant to the world.  Certainly you could say he changed the world and how it felt about technology.  But, that doesn't really seem to accurately grasp it.  What Steve Jobs did was more impressive, he anticipated what the world needed before it asked.  Changing the world can be as simple as dictating, while foretelling requires the keen integration of technological advancement and human progression.  Too often the term visionary is applied loosely and inappropriately.  But, Steve Jobs embodied the definition.  Humbly,&nbsp;
 I had no idea how attached I was to Mr. Jobs until just a few minutes ago when I pulled out of a studying haze and checked my email to see the news of his death. I am absolutely tech illiterate but have come to depend on Apple for beautifully functioning products that let me use a device rather than be confused by one. I am deeply grateful to Mr. Jobs and the rest of the Apple for their creativity, efforts, and amazing will to make these products affordable for the average American. I am deeply saddened by this news. My heart goes out to Mr. Jobs's family, friends, and everyone at Apple.  My sincere sympathies
Steve will be missed, but thankfully he helped us live a little easier  in our daily lives.  Bless his family.
Perdemos mesmo, um grande homem, que revolucionou a tecnologia no mundo, em todos os sentidos. Salve Jobs!!! 
From the early days with Steve Wozniak to the iPad I now hold in my hands I have lived in amazement, wonderment, and awe at the inspiring figure that is Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs. The most valuable CEO in the world. This hard working, and determined man has passed away. You gave us the iPhone, and the MacBook. But you gave us more than that. You gave us hope that the future is bright and we can hold it in our hands. Rest In Peace and with every time an Apple device is used, we send our gratitude to you and to the iCloud in heaven where we and I personally hope you rest.  R.I.P Steve. I didn't know you personally, but i feel like I have lost a friend. 
Thank you for the products , the spirit , the joy, thank you for  everything. I just opened my computer and saw the sad news. i've seen  all of his speeches and presentations, and all of them meant very much  to me. He was a great guy, and a visionary, i believe in Apple, always  will, but i can't  say i will have the same excitement, that one witch  only Steve could produce with his worlds. There goes a genius.&nbsp;
We lost a part of living history ... I am grateful to know that this genius lived in my time ... and we closely monitor this icon named Steve Jobs...&nbsp;
 You will be missed by all of us Mac Geeks. My prayers are with your family.
We are all blessed by the inspiration &amp; ingenuity of this marvelous man! This icon will never be forgotten!!!&nbsp;
 I just thought I would like to send my thoughts to Steves family and friends, he was truly a hero of modern technology.&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened by the world's loss. His creative genius will be missed !! My prayers to his family &amp; friends.
 There are no words, No lamentations, Nothing that can convey ...the loss the pain.  There is always joy, Always innovation, A forever feeling of awe and wonder.  Inspiration, passion and courage to build a dream, that is what you have  taught me.  THANK YOU  Steve will be remembered as one of the giants of creative genius. Like  Henson, like Lennon, he has gone too soon.  Apple has changed my life.&nbsp;
Fuiste ejemplo de perseverancia, de una vision clara. Cambiaste el modo de vivir del mundo entero! Tu genialidad trascendera historia. Descansa en paz Steve!&nbsp;
You will truly be missed. Thank you for  everything you have done for technology.&nbsp;
Condolences to his family and friends. May his legacy serve to give you a little warmth however small the consolation - He lived a remarkable life and you were lucky to know him.  He changed a lot of lives and in his way helped to provide many with a new opportunity to make the world a better place. Few men in history have achieved this.  May his memory serve to inspire others to look beyond the gadgets and to see his most precious qualities that he brought to the people who knew him. May it inspire new blood to take us further into the next century.&nbsp;
You were one of those rare CEOs and soul who truly inspires... Who makes one wonder why aren't we all more like you as humans. Thank you for your daring vision to change the World for Good. We will carry your torch onward on! RIP Steve.
Hi, I feel so sorry for your loss whoever is reading this. Steve was a  very memorable man. I know he was caring, loving, and even happy. He was  very respectful to others. Everybody will miss him as he is gone. I hope  that nobody will ever forget about STEVE JOBS.
  Thanks, for everything, Steve.  Rest in peace. We all missing you!&nbsp;
I'm sorry you had to suffer through this terrible illness of cancer. Thank you for doing what you did for the computer industry and making it what it is today.  God bless you and Your Family.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve.  You made rich and exciting for all of our lives who lived with you.
Being a huge fan of Steve Jobs has me sad that he passed away.&nbsp; He brought me joy in my life and inspired me to be the best that I can be.&nbsp; He changed the game and will remain as the best.&nbsp; It's a sad day all of us.&nbsp; A genius is resting in peace.
I would like to believe that the value of one's life is how others will  remember you when you are gone. In this case I applaud Steve for the  person he was portrayed as and so highly respected by his colleagues and  business competitors alike. My condolences to his family who surely must  stand proud by his well doings and amazing visions that benefitted us  all. I am a proud owner of several products he designed yet more proud  and satisfied to have bought them from and individual such as he and the  company that stands behind him, Apple.  He will be greatly missed yet his memories will last many lifetimes  ahead...rest in peace.
I can still recall the how I was amazed when I see the first generation of iPod the first time at the year of 2002. That's the first time I know Apple products. Not until the iPhone was published, I knew Jobs himself. I had a first generation iPhone. As a Chinese fan, it is quite hard for me to get an iPhone that time. You can't possibly imagine, it is a such of proud to have an iPhone then.  I don't know much about Jobs, all our impressions of him are from his creative perfect products. As a Chinese style of condolence, I hope he has his good way to heaven. &nbsp;
An icon, a legend, a creative genius, an amazing human being.  It is hard to imagine the consumer technology space without Steve Jobs - becasue Steve Jobs/Apple is what the consumer technology space is all about. 
I keep typing, deleting and typing again, such is the impact I feel and a loss of words as to how best to express my feelings at the news of Steve's passing.  Devastated. Gutted.   I think it's safe to say that every aspect of our lives has in some way been affected by Steve and in ways we can't even imagine.   Drive can make money and it can make a company successful, but that doesn't change the world. His unique outlook, sensibilities and general character which he brought into everything he did and it shows like a signature style of painting.  Steve was a visionary, a risk taker and a very cool geek. I honestly despise using the past tense because to me whilst that person continues to impact your life they continue to be with you.
Thanks Steve. I'm typing this  message to him with his creation. A memory of wonderful inspiration and passion for something he believed  in for the world to enjoy. God speed Steve. We will be eternally grateful for you and all you have  done for all of us. We will miss you.
Jobs be happy in heaven and thank u for your great work. Best wishes to Jobs and his family, also to Apple.&nbsp;
This is a big loss. I am so saddened. My heart goes out to his family. Today the tech world lost genius, innovator and symbol of creativity and inspiration for many. I happened to be Apple’s follower since I got my first iPod four years ago and ever since I am in deep relationship with many Apple’s products. He was a great speaker every time when he takes stage on Apple’s event.
Glad to have witnessed a golden era, an era of innovation, an era in which Steve Jobs had to innovate in the technology world. Its history is already marked in the books and the history of technology. Forces to all the relatives.
Even though I'm only a teenager, this news shocked me to the core. Steve  has been my idol since my uncle handed me his old original macintosh to  play with. Since then my collection of Apple products has grown  significantly. As I live in Australia, I still set my alarm at 3 a.m.  every time there is an Apple Keynote on, just so I can see what's  happening. Even though you don't know me, I'd like to pass on my condolences to  Steve's family, and his friends. It was a wish of mine that I would one  day meet this genius. But now, it'll just remain a dream. R.I.P Steve Jobs!!!!!!! Your innovation and creativity have shaped to unspeakable levels.
Thank you Steve Jobs, you made the world a better place. You will be missed.
 With all of the people at apple, and with everyone who knew Steve personally, I would like to share my sincere condolences. Steve was a wonderful exemplar of a human being and a great inspiration to us all. As the creative genius and visionary he was, he changed the world and the perspective on society for the better. So, rest in peace, Steve Jobs - legendary dreamer and innovator of the world. Your genius and inspiration will forever be missed. But your spirit and legacy will never be forgotten. I do not share the pleasure of having known Steve personally, but as a fellow dreamer, I will always feel honored to have existed in his presence.   "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life."
Steve Jobs has affected my life to an unknowable degree. It is with  great sadness that I, and a world of others, must say goodbye to a man  we stood in awe of.  He made it possible for me to see my family in the palm of my hand even  though they are, physically, 2000 km away. He lightened the load of my  backpack by 1kg. He made anything I could possibly need, available at  the touch of a finger.  I use his innovations hourly, and they amaze me daily. His legacy will  remain with me throughout my lifetime.  Thank you Steve.
Steve was the God in America. He built a strong foundation from scratch and it blossomed into something almost everyone touches in their everyday lives. I'm a new apple user of 4 years but felt like I've been a part of his family and successes for years. I just want to say I appreciate the opportunity to have grower with the company. Purchase the many products and here to see the many more products will prevail in the future. Steve will be missed.&nbsp;
You will be missed.   Thank you for all the neat toys.  Rest in peace &amp; God bless you.&nbsp;
How do you say goodbye to someone whom you have never met?  Quite the quandary, especially if the life's work of the departed has a profound impact on your daily life.  Nevertheless, I am compelled to show my appreciation for all of the sacrifices, heartaches, and obstacles that Mr. Jobs undoubtedly encountered during his quest to make the world a better place.  His remarkable vision and uncompromising standards served him well during his journey, and he certainly succeeded in bestowing more upon mankind than he could ever receive.  I would like to offer my condolences to all those who were fortunate enough to share time with Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
We will all miss you so very much. You have made a world-changing company. In fact, I'm sending this email on my iPod Touch. May you rest in peace, and best wishes to your family.
You are an inspiration.  You will be missed.   Thanks and RIP. 
Dear Apple, One of the most influential men in my life died today. He inspired me to take risks, rethink standard design, and challenge myself. He has made a grand impact on millions of people and redefined technology we use today. I will really miss you, Mr. Steve Jobs. It's been a pleasure to be one of your many, many customers.&nbsp;
    Steve always will be in my Ipod, my IMac, my mind and my heart forever.
Steve,  Thank you for everything you have done to the world. Your ideas, concepts and products will last forever.  God bless you!&nbsp;
My teacher's impression of this guy is that he would have been an  incredible child to watch grow up. Incredibly talented, incredibly people centred, yet incredibly  individual, incredibly clever yet incredibly foolish and then clever  again and again and again. Intelligence does not equal clever.  As Thomas Edison said, "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways  that don't work."  Steve Jobs saw what was a foolish dream for many, as being simply  something that just needed another way to make it work. I say to the  children in my life, your dreams are already becoming reality as soon as  you recognise that they are there.  He will continue to inspire and teach and lead through what he has left  behind him - what a dream to make into reality that is.&nbsp;
Steve--  Thank you for making music so accessible in my life! You have made my  long hours studying though college and grad school much more bearable.  And, thank you for a virus free computer! You have changed the world FOREVER!&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to the Jobs Family and everyone at Apple, Inc.  Steve made his make on all of our lives in a very positive and creative way. &nbsp; &nbsp;
Steve Jobs was and has always been a idol of mine. While some people look up  to artists, actors, or musicians, I admire brains and brilliance. Steve Jobs was just that, a true visionary and genius. He revolutionized so much, and  his presence will be missed. RIP Mr Jobs... Thanks for all you've done and the  amazing products you have given me through the years. Apple will be my "go to" company for life.&nbsp;
Steve changed the way I looked at Apple products. My vision was small only looking at window products. Once Steve started with the iPhone I have put away my PC products. Thanks Steve for your innovation. &nbsp;&nbsp;
 It's not end of the world, but end of an era! May you rest in peace!&nbsp;             
I am deeply saddened about the passing of Steve Jobs.  My condolences are with his family. &nbsp;&nbsp;
I am weighted down by the loss of this great man, RIP Steve, you will be  missed.&nbsp;
I feel like I lost a friend. I have so many Apple products because of him. He made it fun then added business to it. He made me smile, laugh and learn. He gave us so much but he did it by getting you excited about every product. Complete genius, gentleman and will be terribly missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family. Very sad day. Thanks for making life more fun and exciting Mr Jobs. R.I.P. 
Steve jobs IS an inspiration to everyone he will never be forgotten RIP 
Steve Jobs was a super-hero to most of us.  He was the counter-culture's counter-punch.  He was a near mythical character who left a   feeling of intimacy in everything he built.  When you used any Apple   product, you felt the feeling that the designer intended.  That is   what art is supposed to do.  Steve Jobs founded a school of art for   the world of technology.  It is no longer Man vs. Machine.  It is no   longer The Ghost in the Machine.  The bar has been set higher thanks   to Steve Jobs.  It is now, the Human in the Machine.  It is about   technology as a seamless extension of ourselves.  This has been   Steve's gift to the world.&nbsp;
Because he lived am able to use a computer. &nbsp;The iPad. God bless wherever he is. 
We will miss you Steve jobs you were my idol and we will be praying for you R .I.P Steve jobs WE LOVE YOU STEVE JOBS!!!!!! 
TRIBUTE TO STEVE JOBS  Me and my husband would like to express our deepest condolences to Steve Jobs family, friends and the whole team of Apple.  We are very sadden to hear about his passing, as he is someone we both admire so very much.  He always impressed me with his creativity, genius, organizational skills, and most importantly - ETHICS AND INTEGRITY.    Steve Jobs always stood out as a visionary, who would not succumb to the lower standards of todays society, where so much is driven by profit only, but always maintained a high level of ethics and integrity in the direction he was taking APPLE.   I LOVE every APPLE product I own, it worth every penny I paid and more, because it was a dream, a vision, that was made into a reality and then shared with me! That's rare!! And that is very much appreciated!   I feel as if I lost a dear friend. I wish Steve all the best in his new journey and look forward to see new incredible things from one of the most amazing beings on this planet!!!&nbsp;
He refocused the world on giving the common man what they wanted, on making their life easier. He cared more about making their every day experiences easier than anyone.&nbsp;
I didn't ever meet Steve, but I admired him as a visionary, an inspirer, and a storyteller.  Each day, for the past 3 years, I have looked at the two Steve quotes I have written on my white board:  "Do you want to make sugar water for the rest of your life or do you want to come with me and change the world?"  "Stay hungry.  Stay foolish." - from his legendary Stanford Commencement address in 2005.  These words have inspired me to always be pursuing the things that ignite my passion in business and in life.  My deepest sympathies go to his family and all those who knew him and will dearly miss him.&nbsp;
You are an inspiration Steve. 
To Steve Jobs and his family,  I am an 18 year old college student. I have never met Steve Jobs nor any of his members of his family. But tonight, I am moved by his passing after his struggle with cancer. His work has irreversibly changed my life in so many ways. The man's genius and his guidance of the Apple company and it's products has forever changed my view of technology and will affect my life for years to come. Tonight, the world has lost one of its greatest minds. Thank you for everything you have done Steve Jobs, your name will live on through the ages.&nbsp;
Condolences to his family, friends and dear ones. Hope God can give   them peace and resignation for their lost. All Mac and Apple users   have lost a dear one even though we never met him personally. Will   always remember him as a great mind and a great human being.  Rest in peace, mr Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Thank you. I have embraced your brilliant simplicity from the day. All comfort to family. Fly free!      
Steve made Apple what it is today. he will be missed. 
 Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'  We are not now that strength which in old days  Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are,--  One equal temper of heroic hearts,  Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will  To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. &nbsp;Bye Steve   R.I.P.
It's a loss of mankind for this century. So long, Mr. Jobs.
Dear Steve Jobs;    Steve Jobs, if I were to personally meet you, I would say thank you for your amazing work. You truly were an icon. My first laptop was a 2008 MacBook Pro. I remembered when I first opened it, I was in complete AWE! I was amazed of how elegant the design was and how fast and simple it was to use.  At that moment I was not familiar with Macs, I was a PC user. Until I started using Macs I never went back (laughs). So, because of your ingenious and innovative inventions, my job has never been simpler. Steve, God bless you and your family.  R.I.P Steve Jobs. You will never be forgotten for as a part of you is still alive and that part of you is APPLE.&nbsp;
"Here's to the round pegs in the square holes..." You give us hope, Steve. Rest in peace, and know that you are a keystone in the arch of history.
You made the most of your talents and inspired with your passion. Thanks for leaving a impactful legacy. May God show you favor.  
A huge loss for the world - Thank You Steve Jobs for all you did.  Condolences to his immediate family.   He will be missed by the whole Apple Family and culture. Indeed, "the world is immeasurably better because of Steve."   
There are few men whose names are as big as their brands. I can think of two: Walt Disney and Steve Jobs. The word 'genius' is often misapplied. But in this case, it's apt.
I'll miss him, we all will. I'm glad to say I had the first generation iPod touch, and just got the iPad  2. I can't believe he's gone, but he'll always be here, right next to my iPad.
 Steve Jobs ...  TRULY A LEGEND Who Left a LOT for the WORLD and Changed the WORLD FOR BETTER.  May his Soul Rest in Peace.
Dear God,  You have placed such beautiful wisdom on this earth. Thank you for the gift of Steve Jobs. 
You changed the world by realizing your idea. You made a better world by making people happy. Thanks. 
My heart goes out to all of Steve's family. He was an innovative genius  and made such a positive impact. It's very saddening to hear the news.&nbsp;
I'd like to thank Mr. Jobs for the great products he and the rest of the team have given us over the years.  I've fallen in love with Apple's products from day 1 which was 11 years ago.    Again thanks Steve,  With much thanks and appreciation.
I was stunned to read of the passing of Steve. My heartfelt thoughts and   condolences to the Jobs' family and his extended family at Apple.    Bruce&nbsp;
Hi Steve, Rest in perfect peace! You are a revolutionary ! You have changed the way mobile phones are used. God bless you, heeps!&nbsp;
I had always hoped that some day i could meet in person the legendary Steve Jobs and express to him exactly how great an influence he has had on my life and my career. For his inspirational wisdom, i am grateful. I've shed a tear or two for Steve Jobs today... and i know i'm not the only one. My condolences go out to all who have been affected. Let's remember Steve together.     
Very Sad to hear Steve Jobs passed away. He will definitely not be  forgotten. My heart goes to his family, friends and his associates at  Apple.&nbsp;
I've never known Mr. Jobs with the exception of his media coverage.   I've never owned an Apple product.  The only application of any Apple  product I've used is the "Apple Quicktime" player for PC's.  But besides any of that....I wish to express my deepest condolences to  Mr. Job's Family.  My thoughts and prayers go out to them at this very  emotional time.  May Steve rest in peace, and may his family take  comfort in knowing that he is in God's hands.  Free of any pain.&nbsp;
Today I went to an apple store because I wanted to buy a macbook for college for the first time. I was telling my mom how amazing Steve Jobs was and all the things he had done to change this world. We get there and every one seems happy willing to help. I leave the store telling mom how we need to buy the macbook not just because Its amazing but because the people working there where so nice. They should be nice because they are representing the works of an outstanding man who has revolutionized technology and propelled us in to the future.&nbsp;  You will be missed Steve Jobs, you where an amazing man and a personal inspiration.... Thank you for everything.
 Steve Jobs defined a culture. I attend the George Washington  University; there is an Apple retail campus store in our bookstore and  literally every teacher has to face a sea of apples from the back of  nearly every student's computer each day in class. I've always had Apple  products -- various iPods and an iPad -- but only recently received a  MacBook Pro for a college gift and I could ask for nothing more. I did not have not know Steve Jobs personally for his death to  affect me. How he has changed the world is evident and upon hearing the  news I felt as if the world had somehow irreparably changed for the  worse. 
Thanks Steve, you made all our lives a better place!! 
 I'm sitting in a library in Orange County, California, and I just heard the bad news.  My heart goes out to Mr. Jobs' family and friends.  Now all that we are left with are our memories.    My earliest forays into computing were as a young boy, with the Apple II computer.  It changed my world, and revolutionized what people believed computers were capable of.  Mr. Jobs never stopped stunning us with his creations, each one was more jaw-dropping than the last.  I hope his death will be a reminder of our own mortality, and that it will force us to do that which we have put off for far too long.  God bless you Mr. Jobs, and thank you for making the world a much more interesting place.
Thank you Steve for creating a device that helped my kids learn to read, share and explore the world with a touchGod bless you and your family. I know you are in heaven's IT department building the literal iCloud!&nbsp;
Through your work and inspiration you have changed what I do and how I do it, and you have made it fun. My heart goes out to your family. Gone way too soon.
Steve you inspired me to be my best. i am forever grateful.&nbsp;
Ever since I was eleven and I got my first iPod Nano I realized how much of a  genius he was and such an amazing person. Ever since then (3 years ago) Steve has always been my hero and I hope that I can even manage to fit in his f oot steps.R.I.P Steve Jobs You were a great man and a revolutionary thinker.&nbsp;
My humble condolences to the family. Steve made this world a better place.&nbsp;
 The news of Steve Jobs has died that make me sad. I don't know how lucky I am that I was born in his period.   He changed the world technology.   He always my hero and I will always miss him.   R.I.P Mr. Steve Jobs&nbsp;
Thank you Steve&nbsp;for making a better world. We'll miss you.&nbsp;
The world was a better place because of you. Thank you.
To THe Jobs Family,  Our thoughts and prayers in your time of sorrow.  And thank you Mr Jobs for making technology fun... Your genius will   be sorely missed.&nbsp;
I salute you for sharing your vision and creative genius with us. My family will remember you forever. Condolences to your family. May you rest in peace&nbsp;
Can't believe this!It's not just huge lose for Apple but also huge lose for h is family friends and People like us who love his design production, personal  charisma.
I would like to offer my condolences to the Jobs family.   God Bless&nbsp;
thank you to the genius who gave us the dream. 
It was so bad to hear. World lose  genius, Apple without  Steve Jobs!  May his soul and the souls of all the departed faithful by God's mercy rest in peace.
I mourn the loss of Steve Jobs. The world is a lesser place without him but,  a much better place because he was here. My deepest sympathy to his family.
I just arrived home from attending classes at graduate school and heard the news of Steve Jobs' death. I am so surprised at my reaction. It is one of profound grief and I find myself weeping at this news. I did not know Steve personally, but felt him to be one of my contemporaries. Diane Sawyer said something to the effect the world seems a bit dimmer without his fire. Perhaps that is what I am feeling—a loss of that fire that he carried in his own unique and special way. My world has become different in a way I don't quite understand yet and all I can do is be with that feeling.&nbsp;
Dear Steve  Your ideas have helped me learn what I love  Your focus has inspired me to look at things in other ways  Your drive is what i think of through the toughest writers blocks  Steve Thank You For Helping Me Become A Better Musician
Sad to hear the news. You were amazing human being. Rest in Peace Steve.
Thanks Steve for making this world a better place... Fly high as your mind did when you were with us. Farewell and see you soon.
Sending showers of blessings to Steve and those that he leaves behind. God Bless. &nbsp; &nbsp;
Apple products are always awesome, they have changed the world and ME. I really love his spirit. Really thanks for showing me your spirit.
好突然，祝乔帮主一路走好，好想哭，我们会想念你的，你永远在我们心底！！！
Steve was truly a visionary. The world has been affected so much for the  better by his creative vision. I mean i am writing this email on my  MacBook Pro. Steve will be missed and my prayers go out to his friends  and family. The world will miss Steve and his great contributions to the  future of mankind.
Your soul still alive in your devices... 
His death has affected more people than you can imagine.  Much love Steve.&nbsp;
The man the whole world will miss. So long Steve Jobs. Sent from one of the great things you left us... iPad2
My whole life has been changed by the lecture given by you in Stanford University. Reviewing the video of the lecture whenever I am upset or confused has been a scheduled thing. Thinking about you are now gone, I believe that your steps will be followed by a whole lot people, and apple will never die.     Wish you rest in peace.
Steve will be greatly missed!! He was a person that a lot of people looked up to. He started a new revolution of the most advanced technology. He is my idol 
Because of you, the world now thinks different... It is now time for you to live different... Thank you for everything you did...
Hello all,  Very sad news today.  Steve Jobs and Apple Computer have been a constant part of my life   since 1984, when I bought the very first Mac 128. Throughout my years in the music and audio industry since, Apple   Computers in general and the genius of Steve in particular have been   an integral part of my work and life. Apple computers were and still are in the forefront of computing for   music uses, and my business in the audio post production field has   been driven by Apple computers for 17 years.  I am deeply indebted to Steve Jobs and his vision. He envisioned how people would want to use computers and made them   work that way rather that making computers that people would have to   figure out how to use. That was at the heart of his vision and it was an initial reason that   I became a Mac user.  Today is indeed a very sad day. Long live the memory and vision of Steve.
I know a lot of people are focusing on how the world will miss Steve.  I just want to say how thankful so many people are for the contributions he has made to the world.  He is truly a pioneer in the modern world.  Although its part of the human condition to feel sadness, let us not forget the happiness, joy, and truly ground breaking contributions Steve Jobs provided the world.  He truly was a gift.&nbsp;
I never met you, but I feel like i know you You made devices that I did not need, but had to have I made fun of those that would stand in line at Christmas for a sale,  yet I stood in line for each iPhone and iPad I neve met you, but I feel I lost someone important in my life.  Thank you Steve Jobs for giving me not what I need but what I want. My thoughts and prayers are with your family, friends and co-workers.&nbsp;
Since my friend showed me my first Mac in 1991, I have been in love with them.  I have been in awe of what you created. I have been in awe of you. Though I never had the pleasure of meeting you in person I have always known that ever time I turn on my Mac you were there with me. Because I know that a little bit of your soul goes into each and every product you allow to be produced. It's hard to envision Apple without you; I will miss you my friend. To Steve's family my heart aches with your loss. May you find comfort in the the coming weeks.&nbsp;
I am very sorry to hear about Steve's unfortunate death today. I didn't see it coming at all! The world had lots of geniuses, and one was lost today.  Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. We all loved you. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and family of Steve. Steve was  more than a company or a CEO , he was a great man. God Bless.
Dear All,  I'm writing to you just to let you know, how sad I'm now. I've seen this information on TV screen 10 minutes ago. It's 3:25 in the morning, here in Poland. As a musician and music manager these days, I simply could not imagine  myself20 not using Mac Book, iPod, iTunes and iPad recently - whenever working on  music, which is the essence of my life of course. I'm under permanent influence of your ideas and vision, which are simply  great.  With my kindest regards.
The world will miss out on the wonderfulness of Steve. He was so young and had so much still to offer. I'm so upset.
Steve Jobs was one of the most innovative creators of our time.  His willingness to work hard to be the best and offer the best.  I love all of my Apple products and I look forward to many new things!&nbsp;
During a tough time in between ministries, I sold Apple products.   Steve's products reflected his genius and creativity. His passion for   functional beauty has shaped the way I do ministry infusing function   and beauty.&nbsp;
The world will mostly remember him as a technology genius but to me the  real genius in him was his keen understanding of humanity, and how best  technology can serve it.   Surely, humanity lost one of the greatest minds of our generation. I am  sure those left behind will ensure his legacy lives.  We thank you Mr. Jobs. God bless your soul.&nbsp;
I never got the chance to meet Steve Jobs but watched him on tv and he was a  brilliant man and changed the way everyone looked at smartphones and laptops &amp; iPods an iPads that changed the way people live everyday and he will be deeply missed for his creativity my deepest sorrows go out to the Steve Jobs family and Apple family there will never be another like mr. Steve Jobs may he rest in peace with all the other great creators.
 mis condolencias para toda la familia de mi idolo steve jobs siempre se me a echo que es una persona muy inteligente nuca nadie lo podra remplasar &nbsp;DESCANSE EN PAZ STEVE JOBS.            
To the Family, Friends, and Colleagues of Steve Jobs,  My sincere condolences from a fan, not only of Apple, but of Steve himself.  Very rarely does someone come along that not only has his gifts, but the drive and character to put them to their best use.  From afar, it seems that he succeeded not primarily because of his personal abilities, but by multiplying them exponentially through the employees of Apple and countless independent developers.  A true leader motivates and enables others to rise to their highest potential.  In succeeding at that, he has left the world a better place for all the rest of us.  Thank you, and my prayers will be with you all.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you so much for being such an inspiration to me. I have always  been envious of your style of leadership and your fearless approach to  taking risks in the world. Without you, my generation would not be who  we are today. You are the one who truly enriched lives, because without  your effort and genius of a mind, we would not have the amazing things  that we have today.  You sir, changed the world.  To the true crazy one.  R.I.P.&nbsp;
I have never said thank you for all the the time I enjoyed apple devices. Since the last four years you and your innovations made my days easier and your technique gives me a lot of time back. I will enjoy every minute with your devices. Thank you.  
A visionary, he changed the world. The life as we know it. He will be never forget. His dedication, his dreams.
What can I say that won't be said? He made the world a better place. His  name will be remembered forever. Never met him and like millions of  other people, I was light years away of coming across his path, but I'm  deeply touched and sad for his departure. Wherever you are. Sleep well, Steve.
I have worked on Steve Jobs' keynote address broadcasts for over 10 years.  Although I never actually talked to him, I felt like he was a friend, a mentor and a true visionary.  I was always impressed with his genuine enthusiasm for his products.  I've been hooked on Apple for many years and I owe it all to him!  I feel like I lost a family member today and I can't help but cry.  I know he was sick for many years, but I just wasn't ready for the day to come.  He was a genius and he will be missed.
Steve, thank you for everything you have done for not only me but the whole geek community. You have changed my life and inspired me to be the person that I am. You are a visionary who will never be forgotten. Thank You and Rest in Peace.
Steve, you're the most creative, exciting man in the planet. You've inspired me to really go out there and persevere through every obstacle, you really defined the meaning of possible. Anything is possible if you put your mind to it, you will be missed. Watching you during those keynotes, announcing the most innovative products ever, laughing when you said "And one more thing"...your loss really saddens me.  My sincere thoughts and prayers are with you. &nbsp;
I'm sorry to hear that a genius is gone. Maybe, God likes apple products, too.
RIP Steve Jobs, thanks for the innovation that lead to change the world. &nbsp;
Sou Brasileiro, tenho 22 anos, e sou apaixonado pela apple, e por tudo que a marca representa, e do modo como começou..   eu li dois livros sobre o Steve e vi que ele sempre batalhou e estudou por tudo que ele quis na vida, nunca desistiu desse objetivo, e empregou isso na apple...     só posso lamentar pela morte de um homem que foi como um espelho para mim, pq meu pai me abandonou, assim como os pais dele, e vou fazer da vida espelho a minha, para que eu possa ser uma pessoa melhor sempre...         
I am deeply saddened by the news, that Steve is no longer alive, however his legacy should live forever. I admire him forever for his excellence.&nbsp;  He has changed how the humans interact and listen to music. He is the legend and the&nbsp;role model for the next generation. &nbsp; &nbsp;
RIP Steve, a true gentleman and genius.&nbsp;
The first computer I ever touched as a kid was an Apple and to this day I refuse to use anything else.  Steves' ideas were so innovative and creative,  a box didn't even exist for him to think out of.    Thanks for making things just work they way they should.&nbsp;
Yesterday I was dreaming about work with you, but when I wake up this morning, this world lost you... Goodbye, brave man, goodbye, Jobs, we will mind you forever!&nbsp;
Steve was a hero to me and millions of others, his spirit will live on in us  all.  Without Steve I wouldn't be the man I am today, and I only strive to be better.&nbsp;
Steve,  You truly  redefined the meaning of genius, innovator and visionary.&nbsp;
So sorry for your loss. He changed my life with his unmatched products, vision, and passion for life. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.
Truly inspirational, in life and beyond.
Hopefully the energy he carried in this life will come back 1000 times. He will be missed. Peace.&nbsp;
were apples.. 20 years ago during college at University of Chicago.. I still have those computers.. and because they were my first I can't bare to get rid of them.. I am grateful for the fun and creativity that Steve Jobs brought to the world with his remarkable products.. he made the world lighter more fun and inspirational.. thank you and I hope you carry on his spirit at Apple.. and make accessibility to all the main focus..  --    ~Enjoy the gift of the present moment.  Keep reaching for the stars each day. ~ 
Steve will always be remembered as a innovator. He has shown us how dedication and passion for excellence can make the world a better place.  He has shown me that the willing to succeed should be the motor that drives our daily lives. There are no impossibles if we put all our passion and love in what we do.  Thank you Steve!&nbsp;
Aloha Steve, The greatest computer icon and creative mind on the planet!... I didn't  even know him, but he will always be part of my life and in my  professional career as a Graphics Designer. We will miss him  tremendously... but he will live on forever and then some, kind'a like  Elvis eh! Thanks so much Steve for your awesome contribution to  technology, this world and humanity!
Steve Jobs is an icon every bit as much as Apple.  I think genius is a word that gets used all too frequently these days but it can be truly reserved and used with integrity alongside the name Steve Jobs.  His work, his products, his thinking and his life have inspired me and he will forever be missed.
 Today I realized my consumer dream, I bought my iPhone, and when came back home, my friend told me "Steve has die" I didn't believe and I turned on the tv and i saw, he is my hero, my inspiration, apple has changed my life.
I'm very pleased to have shared a dinner with Steve way back in the  80's. He leaves behind an enormous legacy - I'm not sure that people  fully appreciate how things were in a particular market before Steve  jumped in with another 'insanely great' product.  I'm really very sad that this has happened to him.&nbsp;
 I'm so glad &amp; proud that I grew up with Apple, I remember when I first ever got an iPod for Christmas in 2009, I thought to myself what the world has come to with a small touchscreen device that can connect with the world! Steve Jobs was the Leonardo Da Vinci of technology and most of all of my generation. Steve Jobs seriously was pure genius, unfortunately God always takes the incredible people of this planet first. Steve Jobs will always stay with us do to his amazing and incredible art of technology he brought to this world, and for the many others that tried to imitate his work but at the end of the day, Apple always ended up first place.  My prayers are with the Apple Company and Steve Jobs' family.
Thanks for Apple inc. Thanks for Steve jobs. I miss you so much.&nbsp;
He not only changed my life, But many of others. He will be missed.&nbsp;
The world and not only Apple has lost a Leader, visionary, a mentor and simply a genius. Its a great loss to all of us and no one will be able to fill his shoes.
Thank you Steve, for this: A considerable part of my ordinary day is spent "interfacing" myself   with your i-devices, and they do their work, so well, to let me able   to do mine.&nbsp;
Steve, you was a role model, you was our inspiration. The tech world will thank you for everything you always did. Your inventions revolutionized the world and thanks to you our life became easier. You were the brightest minds of this century, thank you very much and will always remember. We love you Steve! I hope you're sitting next to God in heaven.
Thank you for all that you have given the world we live in, and love so much.  The sacrifices you made for your family, and your health are appreciated more than you could know.  The world is truly a better place, having known Steve Jobs.  My sincerest condolences to all who knew and loved you.&nbsp;
My first computer was an Apple and my last computer will be an Apple.   Computers have been a huge part of my life since the first time I  touched a computer, an Apple II.  I'm a programmer now and every  milestone of my becoming a programmer has involved an Apple computer,  from the first program that I wrote in Logo on an Apple II to the Apple  computers I use now.  You are one of the most influential people on my  life and I thank you for that influence.  You thought different and the  world was a better place for it.  I'll miss you, Steve.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs brought me the future better than anyone. My sympathies go out to a ll his close families and friends.&nbsp;
    I saw the multi-colored Apple logo for the first time when I was just 10 years old back in 1995. The original iMac was such a revolutionary design &amp; utter beauty. iPod is one of the most important inventions of our generation. iPhone 3G S is the first ever Apple product I ever bought and I just LUV it. Can't wait to buy iPhone 4S, MacBook Pro &amp; anything innovative Apple puts out there. Jobs is no more but he immortalized himself by steering APPLE to what it is today. APPLE  Steve Jobs. He is still alive. Just look @ your iPhone. THANK YOU STEVE JOBS. I hope you're in a better place now.            
You changed the way I looked at the world.   
Steve Jobs inspired me to follow my dreams and to not fear standing alone with a vision.  Thank you, Steve.
 The last thing my husband gave me before he died from cancer was an  IPod.  That was the beginning of my love affair with Apple  products.   Five years later I play my IPod everyday and remember what a wonderful  man  I was married to.     Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
I am an apple fan, and once an employee at apple retail as a specialist. Working at apple was one of the greatest experiences of my life. It changed and shaped me to become a better individual in society, and professionally. Send my regards to the Jobs family, it's a very emotional time for everyone.
Mr Job's inovation and brilliance has often held me in awe. I have been  a die hard Apple fan for many, many years. Peace to you and RIP Steve&nbsp;
I didn't know him personally, but I had a lot of respect for him and  what he did for the computer industry, RIP. 
Bell, Edison, Ford...you're in good company, Steve.   Rest in Peace.  
Steve was a man whose ideas changed the way we think and do things. He will forever be in our hearts the next time we swipe, click, type, and update. Thank you for bringing your ideas to us and forever changing the world. To his family may you get through this with strength. Think Different.&nbsp;
Hi all, I am very sad to hear this news. Last year I bought iPad and iTouch and I think they are the most wonderful products I've even seen. But today, when I open my computer, I encounter this sad news first. It seems that the world has lost its genius. May your soul peace in the heaven.
Just wanted to express my condolences and love and sympathy at this  great loss of a great man. His vision helped me to actually get so much  better at computing, which has enriched all areas of my life.  Thank you Steve, and may you rest in peace. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an amazing man with an amazing legacy.  He taught me to keep believing in your dreams.  As long as you in believed yourself, that's all that mattered.  You were even an innovator in the way keynotes were delivered.  Thanks for taking 'the computer' and making it so sexy &amp; cool!  I will miss you Steve Jobs, the whole package.  You have changed my life.  Think Different.  THANK YOU for that.&nbsp;
To whoever it may concern, Apple has changed my view of computers and technology forever, in a way nobody but Steve Jobs could have. I cried reading about his passing, but at least he is out of his pain and suffering. He's left an impact on this world in a way that's completely unforgettable. My most heartfelt condolences and sorrow goes out to his family, loved ones, friends, colleagues, and anyone whose life he has touched, or who has had the wondrous pleasure to have met him. I know he will be remembered and his legacy will live on throughout Apple and the technology world.  Sincerely, A proud Apple supporter and customer. 
Steve,  I feel lucky to live on earth as the same time as you did..  Just thank you for the all good things you did.&nbsp;
A man who truly went back to the future.&nbsp;  I am glad to be a part of this generation. Our condolences to his family and friends. He will truly be missed. 
I am sorry to hear of your loss.  Steve was a man who had great vision.  Thanks to him my world is a better more connected place.  My combo of Mac Book Pro, iPhone and iPad keep me in touch with my children and grandchildren who live far from me.   With the devices Steve pioneered I can not only hear them but I can see them, live and in action. That means a lot to me.  Thank you for all you have done and may you rest pain free and in peace now.
To all close to Steve Jobs, Please accept my condolences. 
I send my sincerest sympathies to his friends, his loved ones, and his  co-workers. The man was a historical visionary and the world has lost a  great man. I myself am truly saddened by this misfortune.&nbsp;
It is very sad. We grieve and remember. We present condolences to all  relatives. Steve has made much for people and very much has early left  this world. 
Thank you, Thank you, Thank you. Steve Jobs...  Your spirit will be forever, and forever.&nbsp;
Fair Winds and Following Seas Mr. Jobs  Thanks for elegant simplicity for the end user. 
There are no words to describe the wonders this man has put on earth.   He pushed creativity to change the fundamental of how the human race  utilizes modern technology, where form does not get in the way of  function, but rather blends the two seamlessly.  He will be missed, but we must appreciate the time we had with him to  experience what he leaves us.  The inspiration is that he accomplished  so much in such a short period of time.  Simply wondrous in that passion  does drive the human spirit to succeed.&nbsp;
I never met Steve, but I feel like I lost an old, treasured friend. I've  been using Apple products since 1979, so Steve has had an impact on my  life for over 30 years. He raised product design to an art form. He's  accomplished more than enough, but who knows what other products he  could have inspired given another 30 years.
I think many people would answer the question, "How would you like to be remembered when you're gone?" with the answer, "I'd like to know I made a difference."  I know I would.  There's no question Steve Jobs made a difference in the world we all live in and the way we live in it.  For some it's more direct than others, but the impact he made was global and lasting.  I send condolences and love to his family and friends. I'm so sorry for your loss.
God Bless You Steve Jobs.  You Were An Awesome Person.
My condolences to Steve's family and friends, and everyone at Apple who  looked up to him. I worked in software at NeXT for about 7 years, and  remember his vision during that time. He'll be sorely missed.&nbsp;
Steve RIP. You have changed the computer business. Thank you steve for  making everything fun again.
Rest in peace, Steve Jobs -- we thank you for all of your genius contributions that forever changed our society, decade after decade after decade. We will miss you dearly. Goodbye, friend.
I am very pleased with the success of Apple and the man who created it. Because of our beloved Steve, he created a technology company that I believe, will not be surpassed by any other "trying hard" companies for years to come. He just didn't create a line of exotic products that made Apple so unique from other rivals; but also an icon that is very well recognized by almost every technology geeks out there. All of the current creations of devices from other companies that are trying to imitate the look and feel of Apple products are a great example of a sign that defines how powerful Apple, Inc. and Steve is; very influential. I'm still on my first Apple product, the iPod touch 4gen, and I absolutely adore it that it is always within 5 ft of me 24/7. Owning a first Apple product is a tech nirvana and I will always look forward to your remarkable, outstanding, and world class company.&nbsp;
The man was an innovator, a visionary, a genius and an artist. Although his influence will be greatly missed his contribution to the world of technology and life itself will indefinitely stand the test of time.  Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs.  “Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.” “I have always wished that for myself.” - Steve Jobs
Thank you for everything! You will be an inspiration forever! 
Thanks for teach me the love for the computers. RIP Mr: Jobs 
You will be missed. My love to your family.
My heart felt condolences to great leader, visionary and &nbsp;extraordinary entrepreneur who the world will remember over next 100 years.  My God rest his soul.&nbsp;
Simply (one of the Steve's fundamental ideologies), no words at all. Just simply meaningful silence that will echo throughout ages...
I know you can't read this, but thank you Steve Jobs, and Apple, for giving me 4 phones, 7 computers, and a ton of memories that without an Macintosh, iPod, or iPhone, I would have never been able to make.   
2011-10-06:  Now,the heaven have Iphone.You still here...&nbsp;
I don't know you personally. With your powerful imagination, you have created marvelous innovations for this world to see. Even though I live half the world across, still I'll remember you every time I use my iPhone or iPad. You  are the inspiration for this world and me, Steve Jobs.
Dear Steve,  I consider myself lucky to be in the same era as you were. You were the reason why I look forward for every day!  May god give strength to your family to bear this loss. Nevertheless, take care buddy!&nbsp;
As the world mourns the passing of an innovator we can only express   our gratitude for the long hours, focus on the details, times you   stood firm on your vision and the passion to outdo yourself.  We honor your memory by carrying the tourch of your legacy as you   cross the finish line. Not celebrating just a man but the vision you   left.  Rest in peace, Steve Jobs
Sentido Pesame,  The best ever.
I am sorry to hear that Steve Jobs has passed. I'm sure Apple will  continue to innovate. Steve Jobs taught us the importance of entrepreneurial courage. He taught us that dreaming is real.&nbsp;
When I bought the Mac in 1984, little did I know it was just the beginning of my love affair with Apple.  Steve has changed my life for the better , and I am so thankful for his vision. One of my biggest goals was to work for Apple.  I am so grateful that I worked for Apple for 4 years part time.   I loved every minute. The people I worked with are family, and I know my family is feeling a great loss today. Thank you, Steve for all the Joy you have brought to all of us who use your creations.
Dears, He's one of the great minds in this century. I couldn't imagine what the world would have been if he hadn't created such those amazing things. He'll be remembered for always.
I received the news of Steve's death on my iPhone 4, and read the many tributes and honorings on my iPad2. While enjoying the fruits of genius I read about the life and death of their inventor. I am impressed, grateful and inspired. Thank You Steve
I recieved my first iPod when I was 13 years old. It was an iPod mini, and I still have it in my bedroom. I was amazed by it's beauty, it's simplicity and by the click wheel! That was the thing that got me wondering "who could think of such an easy way to scroll through menus?".  A years later I received an iMac for Christmas. Everyone from my family was curious to see how it worked, and through the past 4 years I have been using and learning how to take advantage of each and single feature of it. I have since then watched every Apple keynote, starting from the introduction of the first Macintosh to the unveal of the iPhone 4s.  I started college just a week ago and I had chosen already to follow Computer Sciences, as my dream was to actually work for Steve, or at least get to see him in the hall. I mourn the fact that it won't be possible, but I have true beliefs that the Apple team will continue his proud work.  We have indeed lost a genious, but I chose today not to lose my dream and to work and study so that maybe, one day, I get to step inside the Apple campus.  I pray that he rests in peace, and I truly believe he has acomplished most of his life's goals.  This is a fan's point of view, from across the Atlantic Ocean.  
I may never have known him personally, but as an owner of several iPods and an iPhone, and as a lover of technology, this is a deep loss for me. May you Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs. You will be missed.&nbsp;
As a 16 year veteran educator, I have seen the impact that Steve's vision and creations have effected a generation of children, including me. I am thankful the world had an opportunity to share Steve for a short while. It has made all the difference.   
Thinking back to my ipods and the convenience they brought, I have to be thankful for the innovation that spurred it. Thank you. RIP Steve. 
Desde Chile les doy mis condolencias, se ha ido de este mundo un hombre maravilloso. Luego de cinco años perdidos en la universidad las esperanzas se fueron de mi vida y me sentí derrotada, gracias a su discurso que dió en la universidad de Stanford para una graduación volví a creer en mi y a recuperar el tiempo perdido con los mios.  Un abrazo gigante y solo pedir que Dios nos envié más hombres como Steve.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve......Condolences from Mumbai. You really were a unique person, this earth would ever had. I hope APPLE will continue growing with same pace and innovativeness because its afterall you....who are the founder of it.  Take Care and God Bless You and your Family members.&nbsp;
Via the care and concern for the blind. &nbsp;I have managed to keep in contact with life. The iPad has been a magic help for me. I can never say thank you enough to him and his spirit shall live with me. It shall be an enormous job to  keep Apple a Steve AppleCare for all people. I shall miss him with deep grief.
No only was he an amazing human being, he was a very nice man who  thought of others. I pray that he will be remembered for all that he did for the young and  old. To the family and friends: Thank God for the  time that you had, and please do not be sad.            You could have been one of the millions  of people that never had the            pleasure  to know him, and then you would just  be mad.             May God bless you and keep you all at this time&nbsp;
You went nowhere and just became Siri, right built in our pocket. So then you'll never been this close to us and still leads the way, So long....
I have lost one of my best friends that I never met.  RIP-my friend! 
 One of the most incredible visionary minds of our time. My life is more enriched because of the products he envisioned and designed.
Even as I write this from my iPhone I am overwhelmed by how awesome of a person he was. He lived his life his way. If I ever own my own company I would hope to run it as successfully as he did. "I did it my way" is an understatement to his spirit. RIP Mr. Jobs. You Rocked!
Condolences from Rome.
Few people have had such a positive impact on the world, Steve Jobs was one such person. I will miss him.
i am truly sorry to here this, i wish you family the best, your memory  and life will go on forever, thank you for everything you have done, as  this world would not be what it is today. now when i write this letter  using my mac book, which will then send this email wirelessly to you  through my apple extreme, you work will be remembered, even when i watch  tv tonight i will be use my apple tv and before i go to bed face time my  2 girls through my iphone 4, and i will then go to bed with music using  my itouch and then my work out in the morning with my nano. you changed  that world and man life simpler and fun for all R.I.P. MR. Jobs&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs,  Thank You for making all of our lives so much easier.  A true genius, in the very best American way.  God Bless you.  Enjoy your new home!!!&nbsp;
Our thoughts are with his family and Apple family also. RIP 
My deepest Condolences to the Jobs Family.  I have through out the years as an Apple loyalist seen the vision he has done not only for the computer industry. But to humanity in general.  Even from the other side of the planet in the Southern Hemisphere. You will be missed.
Like Steve, I was born in 1955, this is one reason why I am touch so deeply by his passing, I hoped and wished so much that he would win the battle with his decease. Unlike Steve I did not move the world, he did that in a big big way, for all of us. Steve left this place much much to early, I am so very sorry. My thoughts are with Steve's Family and all the good people who are close to him. God bless his soul - He left us but he will always be with us. My 56th birthday is coming up this month of October - That day, more than ever I'll be thinking of Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I have never met Steve but i have grown up with his technology. When i was six i had a mac in my house. When I was nine i got my first ipod, at eleven i had an ipod nano.Today i have a MacBook Pro. His inventions have changed technology in so many ways. He is a genius who deserves honor and respect for all the great things he has done in his life. No one has had such a large influence in our world. Steve Jobs is an incredible man who will be missed in my heart and in the hearts of everyone else in the world. To him i say thanks for showing everyone that anything is possible. 
Hi,  I am send my condolences for Steve and his family and the company. You are all in my thoughts and prayers and our country has lost one of the most brilliant and innovative minds of our times. It is a great loss for America, his family and his company.
May you fly to heaven upon angels wings, into the embrace of the Lord  and find comfort and peace. amen.
Steve, thank you for opening up my eyes to a whole new world of  technology; you certainly made my life easier.  May you Rest in Peace. 
I just gotta say this:   Thank you for your Innovation, Creativity, Entrepreneurship, and more.. Thank you for making my life easy! Thank you for making my gadgets pretty! Thank you for your always-working devices! Thank you for iWork and iLife, and of course MobleMe! Thank you for transforming contemporary technology! OMG Thank you for Find-My-iPhone! Thank you for thinking of us every time you were developing something new!... but most of all.... THANK YOU FOR THE IPHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you Steve Jobs for your contribution to modern society. ;-) RIP  With True Love, I wish your family all my love and sincere condolences. Thanks for all, Steve!   With Love, 
 Having never owned an Apple product until our recent iPad 2 purchase, my wife Valerie and I now realize and appreciate the genius that was Steve Jobs.   He has made our lives more fun.  God rest your soul and thank you for making our lives better.&nbsp;
We want to express our Condolences, thank you Steve Jobs for all that you've done for the world!&nbsp;
Although I am happy that Steve has found peace, it is a very sad day.  I have never owned a PC and never will. My husband and I bought our first Mac in about 1989 and have owned many since. I am currently typing this on an iMac that is about 5 years old and still going strong. I won't bore you with the actual count of Apple devices in our home.  I will miss his keynote speeches and know that the spirit of Apple will live on.  Steve, you made the world a much better place.
Steve Jobs to me is a modern day inventor. The most prolific inventor of our time, he didn't just bring new technology to our society, he defined a generation, our generation.  He provided us with a different standard of living, taking life's most complicated machines and making them the most user friendly devices known to man, while making them supreme in the world of technology. He will forever be known as the modern day Thomas Edison, An American Hero.  RIP
I had not know Mr.Jobs, but I'm in deep sorrow. I consider that he was and he still is a real hero, a real Superman. The legendary man who through the life's difficulties and challenges of fate were moving to his dreams and never gave up. Not many people can achieve as many as Steve did. Almost each person on the Earth from children to adult at some point owe to Steve. We would never know where we would be today without Apple or Pixar. At what progress level the whole humanity would be? Steve Jobs - the man whose name must be put at textbooks. Steve Jobs - MAN among men. Steve Jobs - The man whose name should never be forgotten.
Goodbye, master!
One of the most inspiring human beings I have ever seen. He works till the end. LOVE YOU 
I cried today when I heard of Steve's death. I have been an Apple user since  1984 and have enjoyed watching all the changes and innovations over the years. Many of them under Steve's direction. Even though I expected to hear of his death in the near future... I was not prepared for it so soon. My condolences to his family and friends. I will finish with an old Irish Proverb.  "Death leaves a heartache no one can heal. Love leaves a memory no one can steal"  Rest in Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
To those he left behind.  Thank you and Steve for all you've done to make the medium user friendly and easy to tame.     It is truly a loss that he has been taken at such a young age.
Steve gave me the perfect platform to express my creativity as a graphic  design. For this, I am forever grateful.
I sit at my my MacBook Pro and write this note with great sadness tonight. But then I have to remind myself, Steve will never die. Steve lives on - and always will - in millions of lives worldwide, in every song we listen, in every site we browse, in every line we type, in every phone conversation we have, in most everything we do in the course of our days. Most everyone I know owns at least one Apple product. Ours is an eternal tribute to an untiring genius. We will remember you and be inspired by you, Steve. Always. Thank you for all you did for us. Rest in Peace.
Words cannot describe the contributions that you made to the entire universe! Thanks Steve. My condolences.&nbsp;
A true leader that brought the products to market that I and everyone else wanted. He brought the magic to Apple! I have never used products of any other kind that have been designed and constructed with such maticulous attention to detail. It takes a huge amount of passion to lead a company with the vision that he had. To say that Steve Jobs is a marketing genius is something the rest of the sore losers say. He truly loved his products, he truly believed in his products and so did I. I never knew Steve, but he knew me! A horrible day!&nbsp;
Dear Apple and the relatives of Steve Jobs, I am so sorry to hear of the loss of one of the greatest cultural heroes  we know of from the 20th century into the 21st century.   No one I feel  could ever replace him.  His vision of the future never failed.   His ability to bring back Apple from the brink was  nothing less than miraculous. I hope his spirit will live on in all that  you do, and give us a moment to reflect what technology would have been like had he not come back to Apple.    My  condolences to everyone there.    And remember, he fought for the best  quality product out there.  Don't ever forget that.&nbsp;
How incredible it is that I, a 66 yr old grandmother, can send by my phone an email to say how sad I am that the genius who envisioned this incredible device has died.&nbsp;
My son couldn't have said it better, like Mozart to music, Steve jobs is the Mozart of computers. A true visionary genius! You were taken too soon and will be missed by everyone around the world.&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs  You will always be remembered by me.  You are my idol and you inspired  me to do well in school.  I am 11 years old in 7th grade and you will  always be remembered by me&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will be remembered to most customers as the last innovator of today's technology. What he's done for our world will echo until the end of time.&nbsp;
Thanks for the contribution in technology you've done, thanks for the hard work and amazing gadgets you created with your amazing team you changed the live of many people! From this island in the Caribbean I'm sorry for the loss of such a great person and thankful for being part of the Apple Family!&nbsp;
Rip Steve Jobs U R Awesome 
Steve changed my life and the lives of many hundred million people.  We'll miss you so much, Steve.  You made us dream a better world. 
I write to you today, not only to express my dearest respect for  such an amazing human being, but to acknowledge that Steve Jobs does not  only represent a revolutionary in the computer world, nor is he an  inspiring entrepreneur. Steve Jobs has become a legend that pushes  humanity forward. He stands among the greatest mankind has to offer. Thank you Steve Jobs, You have been a fatherly figure to me ever since I  was a little boy. May you rest in peace.
From a device that you innovated .. You inspire  the world Steve.    Never forget you.
I sincerely wish Steve Jobs soul rest in peace. I hope he will reborn and rejoin Apple and continue the work he was doing.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs brought my generation of graphic artists into the digital world with products that addressed the needs of the industry with awe inspiring, sophisticated technology and panache.  In corporate environments that are ruled by PCs and MS Office the beauty and finesse of the Apple computers consistently won converts in the IT departments and made the lives of graphic designers uniquely satisfying.  Thank you Steve! &nbsp;
I will miss him and will honor him with seeking excellence and perfection in  my life.  He is Tenacity+Excellence.
Steve I know you didn't know my uncle, but you were at the helm when he started working for you guys, and that's enabled him to share the joy of your technology and innovation from his first hand experience working at such a terrific company.  Thanks a lot for giving your work to the people, and bringing such fresh ideas to all your projects.  We will all miss you. Rest in Peace.  Viva la Apple!
We will all remember the great Steve Jobs, a giant who provided inspiration,  innovation, invigoration and leadership.   From the joy of purchasing my first 128k Mac to my newest iPhone, Steve has  brought wonderment and amazement to myself and everyone.   We will miss you Steve.&nbsp;
Sorry for the loss of Steve. He seemed like an incredible man and he made such a huge impact to the world. my prayers go out to his family and friends. 
  I don't know where to begin and how to begin. Dear all - I am so sorry.  As I'm writing this mail, I have tears in my eyes. Tears for a man I  never got to know - but owe so much. I will make it short: thank you, Steve, for being such a big Genius.  Thank you so much for all you did, all you created. For your passion,  your dedication, your way to enrich people's lives with your brilliant  ideas. Wherever you are now, I hope you are happy... I am going to miss you,  Steve.  My thoughts are with Steve's family and friends. Words cannot express  this horrible loss. But I hope he's now Apple's Guardian Angel.
We had lost the most genious mind in the world. I am brazilian and I have been following the trajectory of Jobs since Apple started the biggest technology researches in cellphone and informatics in this decade. A persuasive man,  full of knowledge and faith in his words and job. Let God now take care of you. Rest in peace Steve Jobs and thank you about all those things that make people life's easier. Sincerely, &nbsp;
Dear Steve,  I'm in tears right now after learning of you untimely passing. Your  artistic flair and innovative genius inspired the world over. Your  products brought people together and pushed technology and design to a  new level. We are so lucky to have had you in our lives. It literally  feels as if a member of my family has passed away. I can't express my  profound sorrow in words; you were a giant among men and will live in  each of us forever. Godspeed, friend.
Steve Jobs was the founder of a company that would do more than he could believe. He was a visionary, a great leader, and an inspiration to his colleagues and family. He was always advancing, doing more and more, but knowing, or maybe not, that he had a sickness that wasn't immune to him or anyone else. The world remembers him today as who he was, but his legacy will not be forgotten. He did this from nothing, and didn't see his company as more important than that; wearing blue jeans and black shirts to presentations the world would see and believe. Whether the biggest Apple fan or just a person at home, everyone felt a little more sad today when we lost this great man.
Thank you for sharing your passion with the world! My heart felt condolences to his family and friends  Helen
Steve Jobs:Thank you for making my life more passionate! You'll be missed a lot! We've lost the most creative person and business man ever!! The whole world is grieving over you right now. Thank you for making the world a funnier and better place. Thank you for all the innovative products you created, and for making my life happier and easier! Everyone will miss you forever. Thankfully we are granted with Apple, your son and creation. It will always resemble your ideas, strength and success. My best memories and feelings to you and your family. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Thank you steve for opening my eyes to a wonderful new world   There will never be another quite Like you 
May you rest in peace!      You've done an amazing job in your lifetime!  
I find it difficult to explain why I am saddened by the loss of a man I did not know, but the fact is I am. See you in the afterlife Steve. Best wishes and strength to all remaining family.
Dearest Apple,  Words cannot adequately express the sorrow I feel in losing Steve Jobs.  He was not only a visionary, he was a good person.  He brought hope and happiness through technology to everyone from babies &amp; toddlers to grandparents.  He gave everyone life and part of him will live within each of us.    Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and his apple family.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
My deep respect to a legendary brave DREAM implementor.  We will miss Jobs&nbsp;
THANK YOU Steve for the happiness you created to our life. May God Bless you. We'll always remember you. 
*Mr. Steve Jobs,  Thank you, for sharing with the world your visionary and creative genius mind! May you rest in peace wherever you are right now! You certainly will be missed by all always!*&nbsp;
A true loss. Deepest sympathy for family, friends, colleagues and all of those who so much enjoy the gifts he gave us. 
You were one of my few role models. I wish that one day I can be half the man that you were.  
Thank you for your vision Steve and for your willingness to take risks regardless of what naysayers had to say. You inspire me and I will forever strive my best because you always did. You will be dearly missed. Thank you.
Although I know I'll be one of millions of people who are sending an   email 'Remembering Steve' or updating my Facebook or Twitter to RIP   Steve Jobs, I feel like writing this anyway just because I have had a   great experience with Apple products and really admire the work ethic   of this company created by such a tremendous visionary. A couple of   years ago I attended a business summer program called LEAD at Stanford   University for high school students. In this month we were given the   task to create a business idea or product that we would present in   front of different entrepreneurs and some employees from Apple at the   Apple headquarters in California. What we didn't know was that all 30   of us who participated in this program would win iPod Shuffles. We   also didn't know that the winning group would receive free MacBooks; a   gift from Apple, one of the program's sponsors. I certainly had no   idea that I would form part of this winning group, and would end up   receiving one of the gifts I'm most proud of winning: my MacBook from   which I'm typing right now, 3 and a half years after winning it and   still as new as the first day. When I presented my group's business   idea at the Apple headquarters, the employees told us that we would be   stepping on the same stage as the one Steve Jobs had stepped on when   making his presentations. This was amazing news to me; I felt honored.   I felt even more honored when we got the opportunity to eat lunch with   some of the employees at Apple and were able to have great   conversations with them about their jobs and how much they enjoyed   working at Apple. All I want to say is that even though I never met   him, I feel very happy that I was able to meet people that might have   met or might have been close to such a great visionary man in our   world. I felt extremely comfortable and welcome in the headquarters   and am always grateful for the gift they gave me. I will stick to   Apple not only because I love the products, but because I admire and   respect the people that work there and the one that started it all:   Steve Jobs. As many people say, "once you go Mac, you never go back!"   Very true fact. Thanks! 
 I am so sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs. He was an inspiration to me and I try very hard to emulate his work ethic and his understanding of the absurdity of Life. He will always be on my mind, and I want to thank Steve Jobs for enriching my life. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp;
 I just want to thanks Steve for his life that changed all ours.... Rest in peace.. you have done what you have to.. and you did it great!!!
 My condolences to his family.  He truly helped shape history. We will miss you. My hope is that your vision and inspiration continues to shine on us all.
In 1984, you forever changed my life. Profoundly grateful.  Sincere condolences
 Dear Steve, thank you for bringing apple to us. you truly are a genius and i will remember you for that. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I never got to meet Steve Jobs. I did anticipate it though. I am a twelve year old boy. A twelve year old boy who did not wait to start working on my contribution to the world. I am a member of the iOS and Mac developer programs because of Steve Jobs. It is because of him that I anticipate coming home from school to take courses online and learn even more. It is because of him that I am in the process of founding my own app development company. I own and have owned many of his products because of him. He inspired the world, he changed the world. And just as effectively, changed and effected me.&nbsp;
Steve's approach to life and his passion for simplicity is the basis for and foundation for the career and lifestyle I have now.  My sincerest condolences go out to his family and friends. It's amazing how a man I've never had the pleasure of meeting has such an impact on my everyday life. The world is a better place now because of him and unfortunately today, a sadder one.   I have no doubts that Apple's core will retain the foundation that Steve cultivated over the years.  A great man but an even greater legacy.  Peace and Love Steve.&nbsp;
You will truly be missed steve. The way you have given hope to me given the fact that you went through it all and coming out victorious is so sweet. Here in South Africa we can definatetly feel your absence. God be with you on this journey.
I really look up to Steve Jobs, I refuse to use the past tense because  he will forever be someone I idolize. Thank you so much for all you have  done for the world- I will sincerely miss your incredible mind.
The world never forget him.
Steve Jobs and Apple products literally changed my life, the way I think and  the way I Live . . . My father always said "Learn to record, "Learn to sing" and Apple let me! Gave me the ease and the ability to do so!  Such a Beautiful mind!&nbsp;
Even though I didn't know him and I'm just 14, I feel like I just lost a  close friend, seriously, he was my idol, I loved him, he was one of the  reasons I started to choose Apple instead of any other company, his way  of thinking, his sympathy when giving speeches, his simplicity and  humility, he was the best man I ever heard of. Rest In Peace Steve, my  idol, visionary and genius.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs was indeed an amazing figure, one who paved the way for the  harmonious relationship between man and machine, technology and art.  Best of luck to Apple in it's future, and my deepest condolences to all  of us affected by his passing.
My condolences on Steve's death.
Man I used to wish that I could be in Mr Jobs Position I'm 11 and am in 7th g rade my school loves apple and has many vintage macs and have a portrait of him on the wall I had wished of meeting Steve one day he was a inspiration and a great thoughtful person I loved him as well as many others I hope that apple will not die and will stay strong as it is now and make many new and improved products man I just wished I could have met him before he passed he will be missed as a person of thought, inspiration, and a big chunk of technology you will be missed Steve Rest In Pease

 Steve jobs was Pure Inspiration for me, learned a lot from Mr. Jobs. 
I was devastated to hear this news. This is such a big blow to the technology industry and many&nbsp;youngsters who look up to him as a role model. I pray for his soul to rest in peace and my deepest condolences to his family.
Thank you for taking us generations ahead in technology and user interface.  Rest in Peace. 
    We in Saudi Arabia are sorry to hear the news of the death of Steve Jobs. His name will remain etched on my iPhone, I will not forget Steve Jobs. Thanks Steve Jobs for their renaissance in the world of smart phones.            
I remember my first Apple.  An Apple II+.  Then the Apple Iigs.  Then – wow – a Macintosh.  What a game changer.  I remember how different this little box was.  I loved Apple all through college.  Then law school.   Now I'm grown up.  Sort of.  I own a law firm.  And we use Apples.  Lawyers using Apples.  Really!  Steve Jobs was Apple.  And he was a visionary.  He was to computing what Van Gogh was to Art, or Shakespeare was to literature.  It's sad to lose a genius like Steve – but we are blessed to have lived in his shadow. 
Dear Apple,  I was very sorry to hear the news today, we have lost a visionary creative. I have been using Apple computers since I was six years old and I could not imagine my education or career for that matter without them. I thank Mr. Jobs with all my heart and may he rest in universal peace.
Even though I didn't know him and I'm just 14, I feel like I just lost a  close friend, seriously, he was my idol, I loved him, he was one of the  reasons I started to choose Apple instead of any other company, his way  of thinking, his sympathy when giving speeches, his simplicity and  humility, he was the best man I ever heard of. Rest In Peace Steve, my  idol, visionary and genius.&nbsp;
Steve was a smart and intelligent man.  Steve we appreciate you and thank you for bringing the best technology to the world.  To Steve's family, my prayers and thoughts are with you.&nbsp;
Im brazilian and I'm very sad about this, my condolences i will pray for him   
While I was unable to have the privilege of meeting him his work was a reflection of him; brilliant and simple, and therefore I will miss him. His contributions to us will always be remembered, even past what he gave. Few people  reach the impact he had on people and cause of that there are many people who will miss him.
I'm sitting here struck by how upset I am over Steve's passing. Is it possible to cry over the loss of someone you've never met or even spoken to?  Well, I can barely see my screen. :(  Technology would not have become what it is today without him. I can't even find the words to express my gratitude for what Steve accomplished and gave to the world. I can't even find the words to express the intense emptiness and sorrow that I feel right now.  You will be missed, you will never be forgotten.  Farewell Steve and we thank you. 
Thank you so much.  You changed our world.  You changed our communication.  You changed our life.  You changed our dream.  You changed our common sense.
Steve Jobs,  thank you.  -The World 
 the apple products, there design, the history behind all of them make me thought about changing my career from TV making to industrial design. today I was In the university for a "first talk" about the course of industrial design when I found out about steve´s decease.... I took it as a signal.  thanks for everything steve.             
It was 1993 when I attended the Academy of Art University in San   Francisco using one of the first non linear machines operating on   Macintosh computers.  I began my love affair with Apple back then and   have been using their machines ever since.  I got a chance to bump   into Steve by accident in Palo Alto about 6 months ago and feel   privileged to have met the man who changed my personal and career   life.  Every time I use my Mac I will always feel a little bit of   Steve's presence encouraging me to dream and achieve. My condolences   to his friends and family. God bless you Steve. You will always be   with us.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for sharing your  genius with the world. The world is forever  in your debt. Rest In Peace. 
I'm a graphic designer of the same generation as Chip Kidd--in commercial  art school, we were the last to learn how to do pasteups, use a stat  camera, and master mysterious tools like ruling pens and phototypositors.  We were also the first to have the benefit of the amazing Macintosh (the  Classic, maybe. My first was a IIcx) which instead of being a scary,  impersonal machine, was a friendly face that told us everything would be  all right, that we could learn and create and dream.   Thank you, Steve Jobs, for being the best kind of designer and human being.  And thank you Apple, for continuing in his legacy.
Thank you Steve for your work all these years. You changed our lives! We never forget you. Rip
Dear friends,     We lost a brilliant mind!!!   R.I.P. my friend&nbsp;
STEVE JOBS VISIONARY GENIUS WILL LIVE ON FOREVER.  WITH A NEW VISION AND AMAZING CREATIVITY HE CREATED SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND INNOVATIVE DEVICES.  HE INSPIRED THE WORLD TO THINK BIGGER, BRIGHTER AND MORE INTELLIGENTLY.  HIS CURIOSITY NEVER WAVERED AND THAT IS AN INSPIRATION FOR ALL OF US TO LIVE UP TO.  THANK YOU STEVE JOBS FOR YOUR UNWAVERING CONTRIBUTION.
You were never about yourself. But you were the best inventor of the age  and you truly revolutionized the world of technology. You will be  missed!  
This is so sad and tragic. Steve was too young to go out like this. My  condolences to his family and friends. I'm at a loss for words right now...&nbsp;
I offer my sincere condolences to Steve Jobs' family. May he rest in peace. 
 Steve, as I sit here writing from my Mac I cannot thank you enough for everything you have changed in my life. I remember the day my parents bought me my first Apple IIe in 1986. Since that day I have loved everything created from Apple. I was there the day you came back in Boston for Macworld. That was the start of when Apple came back. What you and your team created since that day is beyond amazing. I want to offer my deepest symphony to your family for their loss. You changed the world and it will never be the same with out you.
Today we have all lost someone important. I believe Steve Jobs made this world a better place. He's advanced the world of technology in countless ways. I had truly hoped to one day meet him and be inspired on a personal level beyond the masses. He touched so many, I can't help but feel he was taken from this world far too early. It's crazy to think that with everything he's accomplished he could have accomplished so much more.
I have never been so sad. Even though my grandpa and my grandma have died at a very young age and  my father has had a heart attack and a lot of different life threatening  illnesses in a very young age, I have never thought about a person as  much as i do right now about steve jobs. he invented all the stuff i am  using everyday. he is the perfect legend for the 21rst century and  should be honored perfectly.   best regards to steve jobs' family.
Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. You put up one hell of a fight and in the end you became more admired and popular than those who passed off your ideas and concepts as their own. You are one of the greatest success and comeback stories that will ever be told. An Apple was the first computer I ever touched in the early 80's, I own about a dozen Apple electronic devices and they all work great.
Sending prayers up for the family and friends of Mr. Jobs.  The Lord  will be your comfort and heal your hurts.  
You will surely be missed. Your vision and imagination inspired me and a lot of others. You will always be the father of innovation to me.&nbsp;
Lamento muy profundamente la perdida de un ser excepcional que es el vivo reflejo de un luchador que supo doblar la mano al destino. Esto es solo un hasta pronto que descanse en paz.
Thank you very much Steve, you have changed our lives.... You were one  of the most brilliant minds here on earth, and you make us feel very  proud Apple consumers, you were just amazingly visionary and right in  everything you did.... Rest in Peace. 
I am heart broken... the world just got a little less bright.  As someone how runs his own business and does something he loves I felt a kinship with Steve even though we never met.  He hatched the most amazing plans and often against all odds... he would get away with it.  Somewhere in the back of my mind I thought he would somehow beat the odds when it came to his battle with cancer.  My wife and I just found out we are going to be parents and in what seem to be less hopeful times in the country (I am currently listening to the protests in lower Manhattan out my office window) and knowing that good ideas matter... that gives me hope for our child.  I would have loved to thank Steve for proving that to be true.  More than for the objects that, sure, lead to me enjoying my time more and helped me get more done with it... I would have liked to thank him for giving me that hope.   To whoever is reading these emails at Apple... its possible.  Please share this sentiment with those close to Steve.  I am just a customer... but he was so much more than a supplier.  Thank you Steve... &nbsp;
You've had such a massive impact on the world... And it has helped set a path for more goodness in the future to come.
I cannot even begin to explain the loss of words i have. I have never  had the honor of meeting Mr. Jobs however, I must say that he is someone  i looked up to. I hope his memory lives on through Apple. I am dearly  sorry for this so sad and unfortunate loss. My prayers go out to his  family.
 I am incredibly sorry for your loss. My condolences go out to  Steve Jobs' family. Apple has literally changed my life. I have never  been so inspired by anything else before in my life. Although I had  never met Steve Jobs personally, I was devastated once the news had  popped up on my television screen. It felt like I had lost a close  friend. I wish nothing but the best for his family and friends.
We will never forget you Steve, go in peace. 
How can brilliance be so down-to-earth yet so celestial? I personally do  not know but it solved itself in Steve Jobs. 
The world has lost a great mind. Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs.
Steve Jobs, we will always miss you and we will remain grateful to all you have done to our Humanity!   All my condolences to you family and relatives!  
Though I'd expected it to happen "some day" Steve Jobs' death still shocks and saddens me.  Since I got my first Apple computer back in 1977, Steve and Apple have been a major part of my life.  For the decade of the 80's I wrote some of the earliest computer games on Apple II computers, and 30 years later am deploying Apple computers for schools and community centers.  The world will be a lesser place without Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
 Thank You!   P.S World is crying today, and it won't be easy to console it!
Truly crushed by this news, may his family and closest friends rest easy in the comfort that his pain is over.  I have preached the evangelical of the Mac for decades -- your creations remain part of my everyday life, we have shared common beliefs, ideologies, and hopes for the future -- may your soulful energy transcend beyond here, finding peace forevermore.
Steve Jobs was my contemporary.  I'm a few years younger but found my career and love of technology by learning to program on the Apple IIe my father bought for me in the early 80's.   To me, Steve Jobs is synonymous with the era of technology in which I grew up and that which so rapidly advanced the world as we know it today.  I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Jobs on several occasions over the years -- most memorably when he introduced his Next computer in Cambridge at a Lotus Developers conference and at several of the annual Siggraph conferences where he introduced Pixar, Renderman and John Lasseter.  It saddens me to hear of his untimely passing.  I wish to express my sincere condolences to his family and hope they find happiness again soon.  Rest in peace Mr. Jobs. And thank you.&nbsp;
Our thoughts are with the family Steve left behind...Please know that  Steve was an inspiration to many and will be missed! 
Steve Jobs:  We will never forget your courage and innovation to the world. We love your legacy.&nbsp;
RIP Mr Jobs...the world lost a little bit of magic with you gone from it.
The world has lost a person who taught us to be passionate about what we do. I'll see you later Steve. 
 I would like to add my condolences to Steve Job's Family and friends during this time. Mr. Jobs was one of the greatest innovator, inventor and genius of our time. His visions and products in technolgy have made our lives better. He is a true pioneer and revolutionary figure in our generation. Thank You Steve Jobs. You will be missed!            
Some of the best years of my career were spent with IS&amp;T, and the NCC team. I am so grateful to have been part of a company that was founded and ultimately led by such a dreamer and visionary as Steve. Thank you to Steve, and to everyone else that continues to drive the "Think Different" vision with creativity. Remember him, stay strong, and honor him by always moving forward with fresh innovation.&nbsp;
Bye Steve,  As Billy Joel Said "Only the good die young" because in a very few years you gave us so many teachings through your technolgies and so many people lea rnt a life style, you were a model.  Bye Steve.
Wow,  What an amazing man!!   The world has just lost a creative genius and a true inspiration.  We will all miss Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Thank you for all that you brought to us.  The value of all that you have done for us as humans is immeasurable.  I hope you are in heaven dancing with the angels.
 I am truly saddened to hear that the world has lost the genius that is   Steve Jobs. Who else could have created and led such a great company   which has changed the way we live our lives and made it at times even   magical!  My condolences to his family, friends and everyone at Apple.  "The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world,   are the ones who do"  Thank you Steve for daring to be one of the crazy ones.&nbsp;
I just wanted to thank you Steve Jobs and Apple for the awesome work you always do. I bought my firts MacBook Pro one year ago and I can say that it's the best thing I could ever buy.    Apple and the entire world lost an important man today. RIP to Steve Jobs and thank you to all the awesome things and ideas he had.&nbsp;
Our deepest sympathies to the family, friends and colleagues of Mr. Jobs. &nbsp; He truly is an inspiration to all of us.&nbsp; He was a true inventor that changed the way the world communicates. &nbsp; His name is forever etched in the history of this world.&nbsp;
The world has lost a creative genius, anyone who has ever used Apple software can realise the utter sensitivity and embrace of technology and possibilities. Steve believed in something, his influences will be seen everywhere for the rest of our lives, he will be a part of it. Without him, a great deal of amazing art would never have been made. RIP x 
You have been an inspiration in my life. Stay hungry. Stay foolish RIP Steve Jobs
An amazing man with incredible vision! Steve will surely be missed, a great loss to all.    "Many go fishing all their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after."    
You changed the world, we will love and remember you forever.  Rest in peace.
iSad, iCry, iRemember.    Rest in Peace. iCould.&nbsp;
So sad.  Please except my most sincere condolences in the passing of Steve Jobs. The world has lost a precious and oh so valuable human being. He has changed us all forever for the better.
RIP Steve Jobs. You left your mark on our desks, on our ears &amp; in our hands. Thank you for your huge contribution to technology. You made people's lives much easier in connecting to their loved ones, and i'm one of them. You'll always be remembered not for your products, but for what youve done.&nbsp;
Thank you for your incredible vision, grace and courage. My thoughts are with the Jobs family.&nbsp;
Goodbye Steve, You defined a generation of free-thinkers, creative geniuses, and computer scientists. You forced your competitors to scramble and catch up to your genius. Your vision for all technology helped create the greatest products we use today. I will always stay hungry and foolish. Thank you.&nbsp;
One of my heros died today. Thank you Steve for changing my world in so many unbelievable and wonderful ways! The world lost so much today. Rest in Peace.
To the Family of Steve: No one can say we understand, unless we personally knew or loved him, but I can say I do know what it is to lose those I love. Trust me, with time the pain will give way to happy memories. God bless you all.  Thank you Steve: For all that you have done to make life easier, more profitable and more FUN! Let us put it this way "I am a MAC."  Thank you Apple employees: Thank you for your part in making a splendid product. Good job.&nbsp;
Dear Steve  Thank you for sharing your brilliance and innovation with the world. Your creations have helped so many and took away any intimidation people felt towards using a pc. It's amazing to see my child hop on my iPhone and figure out how to work it before I could. And he was only 6 at the time. May god bless you in heaven.  You will be missed by those who knew and love you and by a world which you made so much better.
His courage to relentlessly pursue his vision has changed all of our lives.&nbsp;
Thank You for everything Steve! Go revolutionize heaven the same way  you've revolutionized our world! :)
You left too early Steve.  Our prayers are with your family for their great loss!!!
I'm feeling down when hearing this bad news ;( Rest in peace, and you are always my hero. Always.
Steve, Brazil loves you.&nbsp;
Everything you've done had been covered &nbsp;by other &nbsp;brand... You were a great mind , Apple will miss you&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
I grieve yet I feel blessed having experienced life with Steve Jobs in it.&nbsp;
What a huge loss for the world.
There's a lot more in my  world thanks to him.   
 I just waited to tell his family how sorry I am for the lost of such a talented man. May God bless his family and friends as you go through this very difficult time. He most certainly left his mark on the world.&nbsp;
So sad.  Please except my most sincere condolences in the passing of Steve Jobs. The world has lost a precious and oh so valuable human being. He has changed us all forever for the better.
Thank you for your life well lived. You was able to transform materials into masterpieces of design that help people to be more human. God bless your soul and give you your rewards in heaven. Thanks. 
To Apple Inc.      Deepest Condolences to the Job's family and to those who lost a friend, leader and a mentor.  Mr.Job's, your place cannot be refilled... Rest in peace..                                     May God Bless his Soul. An Apple fan forever... 
I did not have the chance of meeting you Steve, however you are in my home and everyday's life, that's how you did impact our world. You are an amazing human being. Now I am sure that heaven will be not just a better place but a cool place to be in. See you there.
Dear Steve,  I am very sad the world has lost a talented artist. I am very proud to own a few pieces of your artwork. May you rest in peace.
I'd like to express my deepest regret that Steve has passed away. My  thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, and coworkers. He  will be deeply missed.  Thank you Steve for all of the wonderful visions, ideas, and products  you have shared with us all. You changed the world and inspired many. RIP  Chuck&nbsp;
I'm the  artsy type. When I landed my first job after having stepped   out of the job market to have a baby, desktop computers were just   coming into the work place. I lied in the interview when I said I   could use a computer. Luckily, it was a Mac shop, and by working some   overtime, I was able to fake my way enough around the computer using   my intuition. In no time at all, I could show my boss I had the   skills required for the job. And I did. The important skills were my   critical thinking and artistic abilities. Using a computer was just a   tool. Thanks to the folks at Apple, it was easy to get the technology   out of the way.  Jobs got that.  He also showed that product excellence and thinking of your customer   is first. Your bottom line will follow.  
Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. We're really proud of your innovations.
I think Steve Jobs is the true hero after Thomas Edison. We love him forever.&nbsp;
Although I was late to the Computer world. I first dipped my toes into the Apple pool in 1997. I have been a dedicated user and follower ever since. Apple products have changed the way I have lived my life and continue to affect my children and friends.  Today I was very sad to have learned of Steve's passing. He has affected us all whether you choose to acknowledge that or not. A modern day Icon his memory will live on and inspire us all. He will be truly missed. To think that a lot of listen to music and communicate in a way we might never have without him. Amazing! My thoughts are with his family and friends and this very sad time.
It was always a pleasure to work in my first job at Apple In Chile 15 years ago. At that time Mac made a revolution against Windows and all other machines pc compatible. Jobs was and will be a genius, who invented today, dreams of tomorrow. Jobs was a genius like Davinci at this modern world.
 I find myself extremely sad because I have always admired Steve Jobs. He was  a landmark in its time and revolutionized the way we communicate, and if not this terrible disease I think his mind, aided by his team, would still be putting us in a world more practical, interactive, fun and happy. What remains to do is to thank the man, who in one way or another is present in our day to day and will always be part of world history. Thanks Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
It came as a very sad news. Steve Jobs has given so much to this world. He represented Apple and made Apple products an awesome adventure to have. We will miss your vision. Thanks for giving us these exceptional products which everyone loves.
Mr Steve Jobs,  Thanks for creating the perfect hardware that runs even more perfect creative software that has allowed me to rise out of poverty and earn triple the salary of both my parents combined. For the wonderful life you have empowered me with I will continue to pay it forward in all I do everyday in your memory. We may have lost you on earth but heaven just got a lot more cooler.  Rest  in Peace.
I am just sending my condolences, as Steve Jobs was an icon in my eyes,  without his amazing impact in creating perfection in computers i would  have never gained such an interest in to film and tv. With out him  creating such a revolutionary devices the world would not be the same...  He will be missed all over the world, and i know that writing this will  not change anything, but i think that it is my generation that has to  keep his spirit alive.
There will never be another Steve.  Ever.  RIP  
Dear Mr. Steve:                You are the greatest man I never knew, you pushed the science and technology to an amazing state,              thank you and wish you have a wonderful life in Heaven.&nbsp;
thank you Steve for empowering millions of people with the tools they need to make their dreams a reality 
I am 25 years old. I feel like a person in the 60's with Marilyn Monroe or John F. Kennedy. They are people you never met felt so close too. Seeing apple produce and revolutionize the technology industry and seeing steve jobs lead it all you almost have a connection with him. For 6 years I have been watching the keynote presentations with steve on stage. It is so sad that inspirers will not seeing him on stage anymore and be apart of apple. He will be truly missed.   But what a legacy he leaves behind. What a legacy.&nbsp;
You have always been my idol.  
  I was strictly a PC guy five short years ago, but because of Steve Jobs' tireless efforts, innovative vision, and commitment to bringing the best technology to the forefront, he converted me to the Apple ranks. Hoping his legacy lives on and on. 
I lost a Hero.
The world is a poorer a place today with your passing. Your vision,  imagination and innovation will forever be remembered.
Dear All,  The news on Steve's death was the most shocking and saddening despite  his known desease...  He is one of those rare people, whose loss will affect millions of those  who didn't even know him personally. I hope his soul will rest in peace  and God will reward him many folds for the huge positive and fruitful  change he's been introducing to mankind and the world for the years he'd  been hosted on the Earth.  My deepest condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. I can't  imagine the depth of their pain, if I, who never even met or knew Steve  personally feel such a pain.  Please accept this note as a tiny support in such a hard time.
Steve Jobs, we are forever indebted to you for sharing your brilliance, for following your dreams, for inspiring us to endless possibilities.&nbsp; What a tragic loss, but a life well lived.&nbsp; You have forever left your mark of genius for us to share with others and we are grateful.&nbsp; Rest in peace and may God bless your family.&nbsp;
Steve, thank you so much for giving me all the tools and toys I have at my disposal to help enhance my life, help me bring joy and wonder to my family friends and love one, and most of all showing me that once you have done something great do it better again and again.&nbsp;
 RIP Steve you are my inspiration. &nbsp;Your apple products are very cool!! How long does it take to find someone so clever like you? RIP
I offer my condolence to the Jobs family. Small in stature,titan in technology, visionary beyond his years.
Thank you for your simplicity  Thank you for your creativity  Thank you for your ideas  Thank you for your passion  Thank you for wanting better. &nbsp;I did not know you but everyday I live my life better because of you. &nbsp;How could one person impact so many people he does not know?  Only a person with a love for every beautiful detail of life could do  that. &nbsp;Only a person who understands the best parts of humanity could help so  many to enjoy life  And change the world so completely through his vision  Thank you Steve Jobs  
Our deepest condolence. May his soul rest in peace. He vision will live forever.
Thank you for all you've done to bring the technological world to what  it is today. You will be sincerely missed. RIP. 
 Hello, I am 17 years old and I am from Argentina. I have never bought an apple product.  Last year I was at school and a teacher showed us a video from Steve Jobs' speech at Stanford University. It was so inspiring, he inspired millions of people. Apart from being a genius, because he was that kind of genius that can only exist in Hollywood movies, he was such an honest and simple person.  While I remember him I do not remember the creator Apple, I can only remember this man who, with a speech, made everyone feel moved. I did, everybody in my class were moved. Now I can not stop tearing while I think about his family. This family who lost a husband, a father, a great man. So now I feel really sorry, but not for this amazing creator, but for this amazing man.&nbsp;
I never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Jobs, and I'm not sure I know anyone who has. Nevertheless, I sit here on this Wednesday evening in New York City, crying at the loss of a man who changed the way we live, and inspired generations. I lost my mother at the age of 59 to cancer, in 2004 - the pain of losing great people is immeasurable. Many visionaries and leaders have walked the earth, but few have had the impact Mr. Jobs has. We are all better for his work.  My deepest condolences.
We are so sad to hear that Steve Jobs has left us. He was a genius and will be missed.
Dear Steve,  Thank you for all that you brought into this world, you not only changed  the way we use our computers, but the way we see life. I will stay hungry and foolish for as long as I live, and someday we'll  meet up there. Thank you for being in our lives. You will always be remembered and loved. 
I am so encouraged with Steve Jobs working principles. He left a great  legacy of wonderful products for us to enjoy.
Steve,    I did not personally know you and it’s hard to believe the impact you’ve had on my life. You’ve shown the world what creation and innovation truly is and leave behind you a legacy, that is proof of that. You’ve made simplicity, beautiful.    I will miss you
Today I lost one of my heroes.  Steve Jobs was such an inspirational leader and visionary that left an amazing positive impact on this world.&nbsp;
"Mourir digne de vous, voilà mon héritage."  Merci pour avoir enchanté un peu ce monde parfois si désenchanté !  In memoriam
 Hi Apple, I was so upset to hear that Steve Jobs had passed away! Steve has touched me through his ideas and his genius mind, you would not have to meet him in person to realise that he is a great human being just from watching him on Keynote videos you could tell how much he had to other the world and the apple organisation. I fill privileged to have been in the generation when the iPod and iPhone have been released, pushing the technology industry to its next level. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs 1955-2011 - Tom
Dear Apple,   I am a visually impaired student who has found a liking to Apple products after I have discovered the wonders of VoiceOver. I am typing this message on my Apple iPad with VoiceOver and would like to thank Steve Jobs, for whom I wouldn't have this easy computer experience.  The past year I have done many presentations to school division boards and services of how blind and visually impaired individuals can benefit from using the Apple iPad. Shortly after these presentations, I have tutored many people of how to use their newly purchased iPad with VoiceOver and Zoom, and have actually got the Manitoba Education Department purchasing and distributing iPads to blind and visually impaired students within the province.  I do not know Steve Jobs personally, but feel close to him as his products won me over with the most advanced accessibility features out there.
Thanks to your efforts, talent, and genius, you left the world a better place than where you found it. God bless and rest in peace.
  I wish if I had the chance to meet such a great person as steve ,  everything he did at Apple will be forever in our hearts .. May he rest  in peace and may Apple continue to grow ...
Steve, You change the world with your mindset. Thanks for your inspiration.
don't really notice how much steve has had an effect on all of us until  you stop to think about it. until you unlock your iPhone or open your  macbook or boot up your iMac. i don't just use apple products because  they work so well or are flawless in design, i use apple products  because steve got it.
I am the same age as Mr. Jobs and as a painter who also trained in  calligraphy with another Reed alumnus, I tell you that I feel a  connection with him and understand his drive to make the personal  computer something beautiful. I can also say that without his computers,  I would have almost no interest in them nor would I ever have seen them  as creative tools. In short, his machines have changed my life for the  better and my work on them has contributed, I hope, a little to the  world. My condolences to his family, and his larger one at Apple, and  express my faith that we will see another person of such creative spirit   in my lifetime. 
I can't believe you're gone. You always will be in my heart.
One of the most inspiring human being I have ever seen. He works till the end. LOVE YOU&nbsp;
Steve, God needs you, I'm sure. Thanks for all.&nbsp;
I was weaned on the "Lisa" in the 80's, grew up with the Mac in the 90's and have since been spoiled with the "i"'s - pod, pad, phone and book.   Steve Jobs made work easy, computers fun and technology intuitive.    We are all sad today, but grateful for what he was able to do in his short time here.  My condolences to his family. 
Steve jobs was a person I admired I constantly watch his forever amazing and  iconic keynotes announcing the greatest products ever made. His commencement speech at Stanford it's something that reminds how life works and the key to succeed. Steve founded my most favorite animation film studios Pixar there  isn't a single thing I don't like about Pixar and there is nothing I enjoyed more than watching their instant classic movies that will be with us forev er. He is truly the Da Vinci of our time and in my opinion there isn't going to be someone like him in a very very long time because the greatest minds don't  come so often and I think everyone agrees that Steve changed the world; he changed the way we think of computers, mobile devices and music. I always thought of him as the greatest speaker of all time and I would like to hear him  again in an apple event. He will always be my inspiration and his words will be in my way of thinking  my entire life. My regards to is family, close friends and at Apple and I hope you follow his thoughts of perfection to make more great products that the whole world is  eager to see.  Thank You for your inspiration and Thank You for everything you've accomplished. 
Steve has touched the lives of so many.  He will truly be missed.  He  revolutionized the world for us all.  The world will never be the same,  and it is a detriment for all of us to have lost him so early.        
We miss u Steve alot...the lovely ipods&amp; Iphones&amp;ipads we have, u built it for us...thanks a lot Sir Steve Jobs...May your soul rest in peace...u will be in our hearts forever...! &nbsp; &nbsp;
 So grateful Steve Jobs was in my lifetime.  Hard to imagine that someone could make technological companions (more than just tools) that are equally loved by me (very non tech) and my husband (very high tech).  Gave us so much.  Sending this note to acknowledge his impact and send condolences to his family. &nbsp;
Hello, I'm from brazil and I'm sorry if there is anything wrong in this text, I just wanted to make my tribute to Mr. Jobs. I can say he chaged my life, 'cause I have an iPod (something very usefull for me and makes me happy). I really don't know that to say, there must be lots of e-mails more beautiful than this one, but I would like to thank him and Apple for everything.
My first touch in a computer was in&nbsp;an Apple Computer.Thanks Mr Jobs.Rest in Peace
Steve Jobs:  THE MAN WHO CHANGED THE DIGITAL MEDIA WORLD AS WE KNOW IT...... Thank you &amp; God bless the Jobs family. 
Steve, Thank you for opening my eyes to technology in a completely different way. Your products have opened so many minds and influenced so many people in such a positive way. Rest in Peace Steve.
Thanks for everything, Thanks for evolution, Rest in peace 
To those those who knew Steve, and his family, you have my deepest sympathy. Steve Jobs wasn't just some 'Big Wig' of a company, he had visions, dreams, aspirations and goals. He achieved them, he stuck with his gut when he was young and it brought him to be the fore-front of a large industry. He was an inspiration to many people who sought to make something of themselves, I know I did. Steve created a revolutionary world for music when iTunes and the iPod came into light and forever changed how we saw music and videos. When the youth of today thinks of music, ninety percent of them have iPod on their mind. He created something that will last many lifetimes to come. Steve left behind shoes that no one can fill, but I'm sure someone will do well. Again, I'm sorry for the loss of a great man, and to Steve, wherever you may be... Thanks so much for the entertainment that I got from your company.
 I am pretty sure, Steve brought along an Iphone 4S on his journey home!  May he be blessed!&nbsp;
While you never touched my life personally...your products did.  I can only hope I can achieve some of the innovation and inspiration that you have provided to others.  May you rest in peace.
Thank you for changing my life. I will never forget the moment I opened my first iPod and Mac. Those products that you've created keep changing my life. I will never forget your inspirational speech in Stanford that demonstrated to the world your brave spirit,  authenticity and innovative mind that will always inspire us to go forward.&nbsp;
We are so saddened that no one, not even a visionary and earth mover   like Steve Jobs could out run this beast of a disease.  He was an   inspiration and we are so sorry for the world's loss.  
Steve, you certainly made a dent in the universe.
As I prepare for an interview that, up until today, seemed like the most daunting task in my life, I reflect on the words of Steve Jobs during his keynote commencement in 2005.   "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."  Thank you Steve...&nbsp;
To the Apple Group:     The world suffers from a lack of true visionaries. And today one less walks amongst us. Thank you, Steve Jobs.
Steve was the most remarkable soul I've ever seen in my life. He was stubborn, never settled for less, visionary, and brilliant.   When I bought my first Mac, an iBook G4 in 2003, I was captivated not only by this machine's brilliance, but later, by the man who was the driving force behind it. I was an Apple faithful ever since. I love the products, the atmosphere, the soul, and it was all thanks to Steve's amazing imagination and perseverance. Steve Jobs is Apple, and vice versa.   My heart breaks for his wife and children, and all his loved ones, my deepest sympathies and comfort goes out to them. It is always tragic when someone still young and in their prime is taken away so suddenly. Perhaps it is even more heartbreaking when it is someone as original and wonderful as Steve. He fought hard all his life, for his company and his life. Such a soul is never forgotten, and it is to Apple's benefit and best interests to never do so.   We must remember Steve, for the brilliant Renaissance Man he is, and the bright, beautiful soul he was.   We love you, Steve. Long live your memories and long live the company you created. May your bright spirit forever remind us that the "journey is the reward."  
  Dear Apple, I am sending this e-mail from one of Steve Job's products, a MacBook. Steve Jobs was a very amazing man and it was a great thing for him to be CEO of Apple. I send this e-mail for the condolences of the Jobs family, my heart is with you through this event.
Steve Jobs was an American legend and really gave us something to be proud of.
He was "Technology"!.......and.........Technology will never be the same!   Steve, you will be deeply missed 
Steve jobs created the twenty first century, I am devastated of his loss, I remember when I got my first Ipod I was in 5th grade and it was the coolest thing that had ever happened to me, he not only created a technology epidemic but a musical one as well, his technology has spread to parts unknown, and in result the world has came closer together. Steve was The Leonardo Davinci of our time, and for that we thank you Steve and my you rest in peace.
I wanted to send my thoughts and prayers to Steve Jobs' family and friends and his family &amp; friends at Apple. The news of his death is deeply sad.  I first got my taste of Apple products with an iPhone... It then caused me to get all products of Apple.  May he rest in peace. &nbsp;
I just gotta say this:   Thank you for your Innovation, Creativity, Entrepreneurship, and more.. Thank you for making my life easy! Thank you for making my gadgets pretty! Thank you for your always-working devices! Thank you for iWork and iLife, and of course MobleMe! Thank you for transforming contemporary technology! OMG Thank you for Find-My-iPhone! Thank you for thinking of us every time you were developing something new!... but most of all.... THANK YOU FOR THE IPHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thank you Steve Jobs for your contribution to modern society. ;-) RIP  With True Love, I wish your family all my love and sincere condolences. Thanks for all, Steve!
There are those who comes to this world to justify why mankind should  have faith in himself. Jobs was one of those. To the Pirate King!!!
Love you forever.
With the passing of Steve Jobs, The world has lost not just a   visionary, but a true humanitarian.  Steve Jobs inspired people as a   developer and creator of hardware and software, to develop their own   products and businesses. Through products like HyperCard, AppleWorks,   Quicktime, and other products, he allowed users to become inventors.   Through his Disability Solution Staff Project, he gave Disabled   individuals a great opportunity to be equal via technology and made the world a better   place for everyone.   My thoughts and prayers are with the Jobs Family as we all mourn the   loss of this great human being.
Steve forever changed the world... Rest In Peace Mr. Jobs... 
I want to send condolences to Steve’s family. He was an amazing man. He was creative, a genius, but also an entrepreneur who has showed that working hard everything is possible. The most important thing is that he’s not suffering any more.  We won’t forget him.   R.I.P. Steve Jobs&nbsp;
RIP Steve! We'll celebrate your life and your work. It is a very sad day.  You were such a creative genius, such a huge inspiration. You will be missed. World will not be the same.
loved that little green screen. Used it all through high school and into the first few years of college. Thanks Steve!&nbsp;
A great man who leaves a great legacy and will never be forgotten. fought and failed to overcome this battle. my condolences to the family and friends.&nbsp;
You revolutionized the technical world. You will be forever missed.
Peace to Steve's friends, family, colleagues and loved ones.          
Steve Jobs time with us was all too brief. God bless the Jobs' family.
Dearest Steve,  Rest in Peace for you have not only changed our lives but also changed the World and the future!  When I was a kid, I was fascinated by computers but it was a Mac which made me fall in love with computers! Now even as a Medical Professional, my love for Apple makes me better at what I do and made it possible to follow my destiny.  As a self financed student it is hard to manage tuition and I have to work part-time. My expertise on Macs that I developed as a hobby ended up useful enough for me to get a part-time job at Apple. Now Apple also has helped me with my Med school.  Steve, I'm ever thankful to you for making such great products and simply showing and taking us to the future!  We all owe you a lot.&nbsp;
You will be missed. 
You can not see the tears in my eyes or feel the pain in my heart. My sympathy to Steve's family and the greater Apple community. I am an avid user of Apple products and have enjoyed watching Steve introduce new products. Their products have changed my life and the world. We are all blessed to have been a part of the Steve Jobs generation.
 My 2 teenage boys and I would just like to say our hearts and prayers are with the Jobs family.  The three of us feel so fortunate to be alive during his time and see his genius.
Dear Steve,  thank you for your ideology, great principles and extraordinary   belief. I acquired a lot of your knowledge into my life.  Thank you.
To the world's greatest innovator. Without you the world would have been  a different place. Thank you for everything. Rest in Peace my friend
Thanks, Steve for changing the way we see computers today. You've   touched millions of lives worldwide.  The world won't be the same   without you.
I never met Steve Jobs, never exchanged emails with him, never a conversation, not even a tweet. Even so, I feel that he added to my life and will miss knowing he's around.  My deepest condolences to his family and friends. 
This is a very sad day. Steve's visionary ideas help those of us who never could master the workings of a PC. He developed a computer that was so easy to understand. For this and all of his ingenuity to keep developing the most wonderful products one could ever hope for I thank you. You will be sorely missed and never forgotten.
Loss of Steve Jobs life today will probably be the greatest loss for many generations in terms of innovations that are yet to come in the future. The world will always be grateful for his effort and vision, which has touched millions of people's lives around the world in so many ways people are using Apple products in their everyday life.  He will be greatly missed, our condolences to his family and friends, and we  wish Apple the very best.
Hi,  I don't know if you will read this, but to the family of Steve Jobs, I  want to express my sincere condolences.  We are all with you, and I hope you will take the time you need to go  thought this challenge.  To Steve,  I'm from Canada, and the fact that you're gone is making me realize how  much you changed the way people see technology. But for me, you changed  the way I believe in my projects, you changed my beliefs and you changed  me, just by being so strong when everything was against you.  I will never forget you. Rest in peace, and every time I will see an  apple, I will think about all what you did.
i would like to thank steve jobs for all he has done with his ideas from  iPod to iMac. He has shown me that the impossible is possible and that i  would like to thank him. My home is only filled with apple electronics  with iPod nanos, iPod touches, iPads,  mac books, and an iMac. His  products have helped me with my studies and his ideas are probably the  best i have ever heard. 
How your death hit me, Mr. Jobs!  I never knew you.  Our relationship  has been through the neat stuff that you made, the tools and fun gadgets  that I've used, that have helped me do what I love.  I've been an Apple  user since 1988.  Your creative genius, burning bright, has been on the  edge of my consciousness (even as it has been under my fingertips) all  these years.  Thanks for the neat stuff; and thanks for the reminder  that the ride doesn't last anywhere near forever.&nbsp;
A man with a vision who inspired us all. Our present-day Einstein who not only advanced the world but changed it.  RIP.&nbsp;
THANK YOU MR. JOBS FOR ALL YOU DID FOR THE TECH WORLD AND ALL THE HOURS YOU PUT INTO MAKING THE WONDER APPLE COMPANY, YOU WILL BE MISSED!
I never had the privilege of meeting him, but he has touched my heart.   He was an innovator and true inspiration to new generation inventors,  believers, CEOs, and anyone else following their dreams.  There will  never be another man like him, but I hope that thousands will try their  best to become even a fraction of what Steve Jobs was.  My heartfelt  condolences go to his family and to the people he worked with.&nbsp;
Thanks for the bright ideas.  Farewell.
May the thought that you were adored and appreciated by many comfort your family and friends in their time of need.&nbsp;
STEVE yours name is in our heart together with IPhone. We will always remember you.
We sincerely condolences to the families, friends and colleagues of Steve Jobs. We grieve with you. Steve was a great man. We bow to his genius. We will miss him. We hope that the Apple board of directors does not change the course Steve.  Fans of Steve Jobs and Apple products. 
To say that Steve Jobs and Apple had an impact on my life would be to minimize how they impacted it.  When I was in high school I was likely the biggest, if not only, geek in their.  I was reserved and very much an introvert and often found solace with the lone Mac Classic that we had, it and I were loners in the cruel world of highschool.  Had I not found that lonely little Mac, had it not called to me in ways that other things hadn't I don't know that I would be here today.  Mr. Jobs, please rest in peace - you have truly changed the world for the better, not just for your customers but for me personally.&nbsp;
I was very saddened to hear that Steve Jobs passed.  My very first computer was one of the first Apple II+'s that was ever built and it sparked my love for computers.  Mr. Jobs has been an inspiration and he will be missed.
May his soul rest in peace. Today the world has not only lost a creative genius, but a revolutionary. He changed three different industries and did so in a way that he left us all in awe. The world will always remember his brilliance, cunning and charisma.&nbsp;
Dear Developers and Steve,  Our group was definitely influenced by Steve Jobs, and on behalf of  our mobile developers group would like to say, "thanks Steve for  providing visions, and providing ways for the individual to succeed". We  will miss your human presence, however, will continue to enjoy the  foundations you have made for a better World. You rocked!&nbsp;
For taking a stand on quality.  For showing others the value of taking risks and the proper way to accept failure, and, pick up and keep moving forward.  For leading, mentoring and generally cajoling a whole generation of geeks, nerds and 'fanbois' and making us all part of something bigger than we could have ever imagined.  We'll miss you, your entertaining and demanding style and your relentless drive and motivation.  The mold was indeed broken after you were cast and we're all at least a little bit better for having had the opportunity to exist in your presence.&nbsp;
I had the pleasure to work for Apple as well as having lunch twice in his company and he will be missed.  The world can't thank you enough Steve. Thanks for the iPod and everything else!  will be missing you.&nbsp;
Thank you, thank you, thank you, Steve. We miss you.
Although many people who are using any products of apple – iPod, iPhone, iPad or iTune, do not know Steve Jobs, obviously the users are proud of using Apple. It is a symbol of figure, it seems the social status has been acknowledged by the people surrounded. We take our hats to the great visionary and creative genius. 
Condolences to the friends and family of Steve Jobs. His advances to the technology world have enriched my life and millions of others....thanks Steve Rest in peace.
We 've lost a wonderful mind! Thanks Mr. Jobs for giving us the way of a new creative world!
My condolences to Steve's family. I will be praying for you during this difficult time.
You will be missed Steve truly a great icon of a CEO that every CEO  should look to shadow you in every way..&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a great man, not only for his ability to SELL great products, but for his ability to CREATE them. Not just imagine them, but to bring them to real life. What was truly great about what he did was not on the presentation stage, but in the board room and in the labs and in the offices. He had a vision for how a world class organization is run, for what a world class organization DOES, and he had an uncanny ability to get everyone to buy into it and achieve that goal. In this way, he was not only a business leader but an icon for modern humanity: we will need more people like him in our future. He will be sorely missed. &nbsp;
Da Vinci, Mozart, Newton, Franklin, Jobs  Nobody is out of place at that table.  RIP Steve.  
My sincere condolences and heartfelt sympathy to all Steven Jobs' family friends and colleagues. &nbsp;I send this message from my iPhone intentionally and with much appreciation and gratitude for his vision and your skill as a company for giving the world  these devices that have enhanced my life. &nbsp;He will be missed. He makes me proud of my generation.
  Our hearts and prayers go out to Steve Jobs and his family!     You will truly be missed!&nbsp;
This was one of the saddest day of my life. One of my heroes pass away. Thanks for changing my life, thanks for the ideas, thanks for your example. The world lost a great man.
When I was first introduced to the wonderful world of technological advances of our era, I quickly saw Apple had something special: a founder who truly and deeply cared for the quality of the services he provided.&nbsp; I quickly came to admire Steve Jobs as a man who loved what he gave the world, and took pride in it.&nbsp; I was 13 then and though I am only 17 and soon to be entering the world, I know that if there are men like Steve Jobs in this world, I have hope for it.&nbsp; As a future business man, Steve Jobs is and always will be an idol to me.&nbsp; He revolutionized the world, and it has just begun.&nbsp; He has helped advance the world, a world I am proud to inherit.&nbsp; I will try to achieve his genuine passion for what he did and live up to the legacy he has left behind for all business people, and people in general, to see.&nbsp;&nbsp;   To a Great Man. Take care Mr. Jobs.&nbsp; I am saddened that I am to never meet you, but heartened that you live on in the hearts and minds of all people left here.&nbsp; My Condolences to the Jobs Family.&nbsp;
Thank you for giving us the vision and gadgets that will lead us for the next 100 years. 
Steve was among the greatest of world visionaries. Among the ones that contributed to change my life.  Thank you for all you have done. The world will miss you dearly.  I know I will.  R.I.P.
A visionary has left us. As the recipients of his marked vision we are  deeply in sorrow for his departure. Steve you shall be missed!!
rest in peace steve jobs. you were an inspiration to me and many others. you forever changed  technology, and we thank you for that.  we love you and we are all going to miss you. 
Losing Mr. Jobs made me sad.  Although I did not get a chance to use  Apple product.  (My daughter has iPod Touch).  Mr. Jobs will be truly  missed. 
I want to remember Steve for all the good products he brought to the public, how he resurrected a good company and the path he set for the future of computing. May God shower His comfort and blessings on Steve’s family.
i have always been a huge apple fan and loved all your products. when  steve jobs used to announce a new product he did with pride and loved to  do it. i felt and still feel as though i knew him. from a young age i  knew that when i get older i want to follow his footsteps and be as  successful as this iconic human. when i found out of his death i was  devastated and still am. he is one person that i will remember for the  rest of my life. as successful as apple is and with the profit he has  made he was one of the rare men that still wore basic jeans and a  running shoes that would bring in millions and for that reason i loved  him. when he announced his step down from apple i knew his time would be  coming to an end and sadly today is that day. Steve jobs will be in my  heart forever and will be know as of the best men to me Mr steve job you have inspired me and i love you although i never met  you i wish i did it would have been a great honour.
Steve Jobs es el hombre que evoluciono al mundo y estara a lado de los  grandes cientificos que han marcado la historia del mundo.  
I am typing this on a Macbook, with iPhone next to me, and iPod also somewhere close by. So, Steve Jobs' work will always be around me. But, there is something more important that I will remember him for. It is his Stanford graduation speech that I stumbled upon a few months ago, at the exact time when I was making some huge professional decisions. His story about embracing the unknown and "courage to follow your heart" was exactly what I needed to hear. I was refusing the usual path, deciding to not settle, and turning down an opportunity against voices of many, because my heart told me it wasn't right for me. I am not sure where this uncertain, ongoing stage of my life will take me. I am not sure whether I will succeed or fail. Steve's story reassures me to not just be okay with not knowing but to embrace the unknown with all its possibility.  May he rest in peace and my condolences to Steve's family.&nbsp;
Un immense génie s'est éteint ce soir. Sa vision révolutionnaire de l'informatique restera gravée pour toujours. Merci, mille fois merci.
Steve Jobs was the man who built and ran the only company I would ever  buy an OEM computer from, and have many times over.  I have worn the  Apple logo on every vehicle I have owned, every desktop I have built,  and even stuck one on my MacBook.  One time I bought another copy of OSX  Snow Leopard so I could get another sticker to put on something.  This  is a dark time for all Apple supporters, and even more so for every  computer enthusiast worldwide.  From the bottom of my heart you will  always be missed.
Rest In Peace the Great Mr Steve Jobs   From my tiny place in the universe I just wanted to say thank you for   making my life that bit better by doing what you did so well.  My thoughts are with Steve's family and friends.
 My condolences to the entire Apple family. What a tremendous loss for the whole wide world.  I'm sure you didn't know this but you were a symbol of hope to me and will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
First of all, sorry for my english.  I turned on my MacBook and the Apple site was open in the browser. When I saw his picture my breath stopped.  I can't believe it :( 
There are no words. Tell Bob Dylan we miss him almost as much as we miss you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak brought us a computer "for the rest of us"  and changed the world.  Steve Jobs was a difficult perfectionist, but he  created amazing experiences for the rest us. He inspired us and enriched  our lives with his creativity.  I bought my first Mac in 1992.  His  "insanely great" products helped me pull my daughter out of autism,  teaching her the alphabet, and how to properly "mouth" the sounds of  letters at a time when no other computers could do what a Mac could.  Macs have always been about unleashing our inner creativity.  He has  inspired a generation of film makers, digital photographers, and  entrepreneurs.  Not only did he invent the iPhone, the iPod and the  iPad, and the Mac, but he helped bring us Hypertext, which was a  forerunner of hyperlinking on the Web. He brought us the industry of  desktop publishing.  He brought us "WYSIWYG" and beautiful fonts,  rendered on a box that only reads ones and zeros.  He saw great ideas  and he stole them - just like other great entrepreneurs.  But what truly  set him apart from the rest was his relentless pursuit of simple beauty,  the zen of elegant programming, the perfect curve, and the aesthetic  touch that sets Apple products apart.  Godspeed, and thank you, Steve,  for making so many of our lives so much better.&nbsp;
May you rest in peace Mr. Jobs thank you for everything you aspired to  and accomplished.  You have made a better world for all of us and for that the world is  grateful.  Heaven is far richer today than yesterday.
Steve and his unquestionable pursuit for progress has touched many lives around the globe.  He will be survived by all the greatness he has created. To his beloved family: what an honor to have known such an  enlightened brilliant mind!  My heartfelt thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends and colleagues.
Dear Apple family,  I am very sorry for your loss... Steve was indeed a true inspiration to us  all and will forever be remembered. My sincere condolences to his family and friends.
Dear Apple Family,  I was both shocked and saddened to hear the news of Steve Jobs' death. I did not know him as a person but through his achievements he had done on Apple and Pixar. As I am writing this email staring on my IMac, I will always remember his words:  *"You've got to find what you love. And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle." Little did I know that these words helped to guide me to choose the career path that I always dreamed of. Indeed my journey and passion with the job is just starting out, but I really do hope that I will be able to do all my works with the love and passion he had with Apple.  Please extend my sincere sympathy to your big family. My thoughts and prayers are with you all.  I know you will miss him very much as we all will. I am thankful that I had a part of him in my live and will continue to remember him as the great guy he was.
I go all the way back to System 3, and my life was changed because of  Apple. Steve Jobs was the lone voice of poetry and vision in the  marketplace; he believed in the best that human enterprise could be, and  he made us believe in it too. Thank you, Steve, not just for the  gadgets, but for the thrill of the ride and the joy of discovery.
One of the iPhone users in Korea, I would like to pray for the repose of job's soul. He was a great star and has given us comfortable life. His spirit will last forever in Apple. 
What a grand legacy this man leaves behind. Condolences to his family  and his company. Very sad news.
Condolences to all that knew and loved Steve, may he rest in peace his  creative ideas will be truly missed. Long live Apple   R.I.P. STEVE 
I didn't know Steve, but I am in tears over this news. It's so unfortunate that his life was cut short, but the world should be thankful for the innovations he created. A truly inspiring person.
Steve Jobs was a pioneer and will forever be seen as a visionary.
Steve was a great man he made computers what they are today because of his invention the Macintosh he made computers great. He was my hero I'm 14 and Steve was the best I will miss Steve
Rarely has history been impacted by the genius of such inspirational persons.  Our modern age has taken shape due to Steve's innovations.  We can only imagine the breadth ideas he never got to share.  The tech community will surely miss Steve and we all are mourning this great loss.  My thoughts and prayers are with the Steve's family and friends.
I can say I was privilaged to have witnessed one of the greatest come backs in history. Apple could never have recoverred from failure if Steve wouldn't have been back to save it. Yes, this message is sent from my iPad, and when my 8 month old son looks at  in the future I will feel obliged to tell him this was the most amazing and  inovative gadget of my time, and its creator was Mr. Steve Jobs, probably the most visionary man in the technology world so far. Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs, know that the world owes you a great deal.&nbsp;
The world will truly miss one true genius and an icon for our generation and generations to come! &nbsp;My sincerest&nbsp;condolences&nbsp;to his family, our prayers is with you.
The greatest entrepreneur of the modern age has passed away. The man who co-founded Apple, the computer company which has now become one of the top valued companies on the planet. Then co-founded Pixar, a animation studio which has brought us into computer animated age, and brought us unparalleled quality films. To see him pass on is something I thought would happen in my late 30's when he was nearing his 70's...56, is too soon, the man beat cancer and came back and showed us signs of strength, signs he may have been acting all this time to keep us from worrying. The man literally, worked himself to death.  I won't spend pages honoring his achievements, we know them all today when we pop in Toy Story, or boot up an app on our iPhone. Some of us will be typing and reblogging, tweeting, and sharing our posts about this man's legacy on our MacBooksall the while listening to music on our iPods.   The man brought us much, and he inspired me to apply to Reed College like he did, though I couldn't afford it and still couldn't.  So please everyone, honor this man, a man who ushered in the era of the modern smartphone, the man who made the GUI system something tangible, the man who gave us Finding Nemo.  
Its 1983, I'm 13 years old, my Apple IIe with duo disc drive arrives …a spark …a future life begins.  Thank you Steve - blessings on your journey.&nbsp;
Nuestro querido Steve,   fuiste un grande, te vamos a extrañar!!! el mundo esta de luto por vos  Adios Steve!!!&nbsp;
Please accept my heartfelt condolences for the loss of M. Steve Jobs, an exemplary man in many ways, a wonderful magician for our daily living, a great  inventor who kept us dreaming and enjoying life with a unique vision of technology . I will miss M. Steve Jobs, immensely.
RIP Steve you will be missed I guess god wanted to call you because you  are such a good man. I will be praying for your family!
Steve Jobs made computing and simple tasks like using the phone or listening to music a beautiful and streamlined art. Because of him, Apple products have changed how we live and work. He was an artist and a visionary. Steve will truly be missed. May God Bless those he left behind. Cherish the memories you have. 
 Steve Jobs was beyond a visionary or business leader, he was the heartbeat of consumer electronics. So many companies and other technology leaders owe their success for the man they chased for years. He will always be remembered  by the technology world.
My condolences go out to your family and friends. The world has lost a great  man today!! You will be missed...&nbsp;
Steve changed the way you think. A mentor, a inventor, an example!  We miss you!  Thanks for your genius!&nbsp;
You and your words always in my heart and my mind... rest in peace Steve... we love u!&nbsp;
As a former Apple employee, my condolences go out to the family of Steve Jobs. He was a remarkable man with an amazing vision and revolutionary ideas. He is someone who has truly touched the world. He will be missed, but never forgotten as Apple continues to lead in the computer world!&nbsp;
 My colleagues laugh at me because I still have 6 functioning Apple iie computers alive in my special education classroom. I have to periodically open them up and fiddle with their innards to keep them running, and so far, they have stepped up to bat in helping my learning disabled students improve in reading, spelling and math by using them on a daily basis. To you, Steve, I offer my heartfelt thanks for creating a device that is at the same time a fun thing for kids to interact with, a learning tool, and a beginning step to computer literacy. I honestly do not know what I would have done without them over my 30+ years as a special educator. I don't mind the ridicule of my peers; I have helped little kids take that important first step into the cyberworld. I couldn't have done it without you! I just wanted to offer some retro thanks for your inspiring genius.
 I started with an iPod ten years ago and rapidly became an Apple fan. From the Macbook Pro to the iPad 2, Steve seemed to know what I wanted and how I wanted it to look.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and coworkers.  Thank you,&nbsp;
 you physically has passed away, and unfortunately this is " The bitter truth " that we all must accept it. However what you have done for the humanity will never die. You have given the whole world a lesson that is unforgettable. your work and your passion will last forever.  Thank you Steve Jobs for everything you have done.
I would not be doing what I do today without you Steve. As an employee and a user your products, ideas, and your leadership have shaped me into the person I am today. No amount of words can express my thanks for everything you have done.  Miss you already. &nbsp;
 Steve Apple Jobs... will be a legacy that will never die .... The great innovation of person that you are always live in our block.            
Since I don't know who is  going to read this e-mail, I would like to simply present my condolences  to the people who were close to Steve. I may have never met him in my  life, but Steve changed my life as he changed the life of many others.  Last year in public speaking class in college I choose to act his  inspirational Stanford commencement address and the less I can say is  that it was a great feeling to say his words.  I think Steve was a great visionary, and never will another man reach  his success and fame in the business world. May he rest in peace.  Once again, to Steve's closest, may God bless you and your family during  this is time,&nbsp;
Condolence to the great one. This man change my life through his innovations  as an artist, musician, and a photographer. You will be missed.
I do not know SJ personally.  Far away from Malaysia, I only know him by  reading and news. I think he is one guy who had given the most to the  entire world but did not ask anything back for himself. I do not know  whether in this lifetime there will be another SJ among us.
It's hard to overstate the genius that was Steve Jobs. As a cancer survivor and a raving Apple fan, I'm very saddened by the loss of this great human being. So visionary, so inspiring, so genius.   My condolences to his family and friends.   Rest in peace Steve. Your human and tech legacy will live forever, I'm sure.&nbsp;
      I'm sorry to see a good man go. But his life has been a inspiration to me. He had character and vision and was able to make the world a better place.
I am so sorry for the loss.  Its very sad for the world to lose it's  genius.  At least he went out with a bang, releasing the iphone 4s the  day before.  Rest In Peace. 
Very few men are born with not only the ability but also the desire to change the world. Steve Jobs will be missed...but he will be remembered for his innovative spirit. Rest in peace my friend.&nbsp;
  I never knew him personally, but I received the news with deep regret. Surely a man who saw beyond the horizons with a brilliant mind and revolutionary. In his dictionary of words, impossible, certainly not exist. He certainly was a milestone in technology, marketing and the power of both together. Thanks to him we now have devices that are not "just devices." It really changed everything. The iPhone can not be classified as a cell, it is much more than that. After all, an eloquent person, friendly, and someone's sure to be remembered forever. I have no words to say how sad I am to receive the news. My feelings to family, and God help you in this difficult time. Mr. Jobs, great man, great person, and again .... Brilliant. Great loss for humanity, for Apple and for all his fans, like me, who always admired his ideas totally revolutionary. We will miss his magic touch in making the impossible possible.&nbsp;
 I would like to thank Steve's closest family and friends for sharing him with the world. I know very little about his personal life except for a few sweet insights I've gleaned here and there, but I suspect as someone who brought so much to the larger world and to his business, his immediate circle probably always wished they could have had more of him. Thank you for letting him pursue his passion and be the man and human being he was; that is the greatest gift of all.   My condolences and my appreciation to you. And to Steve, thank you for your legacy of what it means to inspire and lead. &nbsp;
My father, who passed away in 1998, was one of the original MacIntosh supporters. He bought one of the first machines and many that followed. I miss my father terribly and one of the things I miss most is how much he would have loved to experience the iPhone, iPad and everything Apple. I often state when new Apple products are launched, "my Dad would have loved this!"  I'm saddened by the news of Steve Job's passing. What a tragedy that he was so young. What a great contribution he made to the world.&nbsp;  In my heart, I hope that Steve meets my Dad in the afterlife and they continue to share in heaven the wonderfulness that Steve brought to our lives here on Earth.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for inspiring a generation, actually several generations. You forever changed our relationship with technology and how we think about solving the challenges before us in an inspiring way!
Today a great man leaves, but his memory will remain with us FOREVER. thank you steve, rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs. You will be missed. What you have done will never be replaced or redone. Your vision and outlook are light years ahead of anything out there. An Icon for life.&nbsp;
Steve was an amazing person who helped pioneer the rapid rise of technology. He will be missed and I give my regards to all his friends, family and everyone at Apple. 
He was a hero for me, a inspiration. Since I got my first iPhone I love  Apple and everything about it. I will always remember the man who  changed the world in so many ways. 
The world has lost a man who changed the world. His voice was soft, but everyone could hear. His vision was endless, but everyone made it personal. His impact was monumental, and everyone cheered!
My condolences to my dear friends at Apple.&nbsp;My thoughts are with you during this very difficult time.  He was your leader at one level but I also know he was your true friend.
Just wanted to add my voice that few individuals have influenced my life or inspired me along the way more than the example, innovations, motivation  of Mr. Steve Jobs, truly a light of the world has gone out today.  We'll remember you and your positive thoughts always.  Keeping all my Mac's forever :) 
I am an artist and musician embroiled in technology, a state I embrace. I doubt that it would have happened without Mr. Jobs and his design-centric devices. I was acquainted with computers early on, but from the moment I discovered a computer that could accept the sweeping movement of my hand instead of the punching of a button or the toggling of a switch to control it and tell it what I wanted it to do, I was hooked. Being able to actually manipulate the {now it seems so archaic} pixels that could form an image on the screen so easily was technology I had only dreamed of, like something from a Jules Verne novel. And then so much more came. Music, high resolution art, motion imaging, and so fast.  I thank you, Steve, for your dreaming, and perseverance. You have enriched my life, and the lives of those whom touch mine. 
The thing that really got me about Steve Jobs was how much he believed in and loved the stuff Apple makes. He talked about iMacs and iPhones like they were his own children. He didn't make a product out of cheap plastic, assign a 12 digit serial number as a name and throw it on a Walmart shelf somewhere. Loving the stuff he made was Steve's real genius. 
Steve, Thank you for your contribution to human beings.
You've given me an iPod, iPod mini, iPod Video, iMac, Macbook, Macbook Pro, Airport, Apple TV, Mighty Mouse, iTunes, iPhone, iPhone 3g, iPhone 3gs, iPhone 4, Apps, Games, my first paying job in college as an intern, inspiration, and unforgettable experiences. Thank you for making me who I am today. I wish the best for your family and hope you rest in peace.  With Sincere Gratitude
My sincerest condolences on the lost of a visionary. Even though I personally have never met Mr Jobs, he has changed my perception of what a personal computer should be. His insight and dedication to us, the customer, has been felt so personal. His dreams of making things user friendly was unique and so appreciated. I hope that he has passed this on to his fellow Apple family, because its a touch that is surely missed.  Forever in our prayers.&nbsp;
Thank you for changing our world forever and sharing your passion.  
Dear Steve, Thank you for all the creativity, inspiration and innovation that is Apple. You created so much more than just great products and services but more importantly you gave us life enriching and enhancing gifts. Forever will your passions be engrained in all our lives for years to come -- and beyond.  Rest assured--what you created with Apple will live on and continue to inspire, grow and enrich the world keeping your legacy alive. You will always be remembered.
Thank you for creating a big change in people's lives with your hard work and intelligence. I believe that you will be remembered by the world as much as Einstein and Edison have been remembered, and I will never forget about you and the world you have shaped.  Thank you.
Although it is a very different industry, as a biologist and chemist, Steve inspired me to never settle for anything less than the absolute best. Apple helped me throughout college to keep in touch with my family and to feel at home no matter where I was in the world. Without Steve's innovation, as well as everyone at Apple, the industry would not be what it is today. Thank you Steve, for everything.   Stay hungry, stay foolish.
The least I can say is thank you for teaching us that magic exists, thank you for allowing us to understand what passion is, thank you for letting us have a better future, thanks for letting me write this, thank you, Rest in peace.
Every time i touch my iPad or my iPhone i will remember the contribution of an extraordinary man. I am much more productive, my life runs easier and even  my two years old daughter loves an iPad. Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
Siento muchísimo la muerte de Steve, fue un genio y nos dejó una gran compañía... Nos hizo soñar, y más que eso a muchos de nosotros nos hizo reales nuestros sueños de infancia...  Espero que luego de su partida la compañía siga siendo la mejor, y así demuestren las grandes enseñanzas que tuvieron la suerte de aprender de un gran hombre como lo fué él.  Por mi parte seguiré soñando más y más cada día y espero sorprenderme cada vez más cuando vea alguna novedad de apple.&nbsp;
You are my role model. I cry every time I watch your commencement speech.  You're truly an inspiriting person.
May your spirit live on in all the things you have accomplished. My thoughts are with you, your family, friends and everybody at Apple.  May you rest in peace Steve.  Farewell.
I'm proud to say I became a Mac enthusiast and Steve Jobs disciple in  August 1984. Apple remains the only company whose products I buy  automatically, as soon as they are available.&nbsp;
to steve. He is the visionary of our generation.
Just want to say I'm forever thankful for all your hard work, Steve. You  have made what I do possible - I could not be a musician were it not for  Apple. I will miss seeing you unveil Apple's products at future Keynote  presentations.May you rest in peace.  With love,&nbsp;
 Dear,   My engilish is not enough well, but i want to send this mail to you and your children. Though i have not bougth any APPLE products until now , but i miss 乔布斯 because of his personality. I hope you will be happy in future and your family.
Steve Jobs inspires and motivates me to stay original and creative. He proved that you can be revolutionary and succeed.  
Once upon a time, I would have never counted a CEO among people I admired. Steve Jobs changed that. Though I never met him personally, his presence at events seemed warm. His personality, welcoming and genuine. Apple, under his helm, produced products that literally changed my path in life. I wouldn't be where I am today had it not been for my first Apple product: a PowerBook G4.  I've often thought about how I would love to sit down and have dinner with Steve. Not to gawk over his celebrity, but to simply chat as two human beings. Although that possibility was slim, now it is zero.  Today I shed tears for the loss of a person I have never met. I can't say that has ever happened before. I offer my most sincere condolences to the Jobs family. &nbsp;
Steve.  You are my hero.  You changed the world in so many countless ways.   Aside from the massive technological advances, just what this whole  world and society would be like without your touch; i don't want to  imagine it.  I'm 17 years old, and i'd like to say thank you.  I've  always looked up to you, and you have deeply effected my life. Your view on  everything, your strive for simplistic beauty, it was amazing. I feel  honored to be able to say that I lived while you did.  You were an  amazing man.&nbsp;
I love apple and is my favorite company I have 4 ipods touch because I like it so much and all things that steve jobs do was amazing and that things that he do we never goanna forget  
I always watched the keynotes, even all the stuff that contextually  wasn't interesting to me, I watched as long as Steve was in it. R.I.P.
Steve we never forget what you did for a World..You was amazing person and creates visionary .. My sincere condolences to Steve wife ..  STEVE REST IN PEACE .. 
My thoughts and prayers are with Steve Jobs' family and loved ones. Live every moment ~ Laugh every day ~ Love beyond words 
 It is a very sad day when such a bright light has stopped shining. 
Steve, you may be dead but your work and innovation lives on. Rest in peace. 
I am in some hospital of India treating my mother for cancer. This morning, I woke up and I was going through the tweets. I saw RIP Steve Jobs. My heart was crushed. I was so sure that I was still in sleep and this is not the truth. But reality hit my face. Now it feels like I have lost a family. RIP Steve, you will be missed immenesly. . --  Stay hungry. Stay foolish. 
Farewell Mr. Jobs. Thank you for changing my life for the better in such simple ways that have now become ubiquitous to me. You will be missed, and you will be remembered. 
Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs.  Regardless of where anyone stands in the debate, the simple fact is, your design language, and overall vision of what the personal computer could, should, and will be, has affected everyone, whether they know it or not.  Add to that the fruits of your work, from music, digital layout, graphic design, film and any other media outlet that has even the most remote tie in with the digital realm. Your influence, from industrial design to typography choices, will be long felt.  All the respect in the world, from one Steve to another.
Steve, Thank you for giving us the opportunity to enjoy the result's of  your ideas, you will be greatly missed, but always remembered. You will  live on forever in all your creations. May you Rest in Peace.
He just changed every single thing we have as technology today.  His design and concepts will follow us until our last breathe. Rest in peace, Steve. You know you changed the world in the better way you could. Shine in the sky as always you shined on stages, during your amazing keynotes.  We know you made the difference.
I think I own 2 of everything you have invented. On some nights I can glance  around the room in our home and see one teen on the iPhone, another couple of kids listening to their iPods while my wife is on the Mac and I'm on my fa vorite toy, the iPad! You were a genius the world will never realize again. God bless your family and rest in peace my friend.
A visionary that will stay forever on our minds. Rest in peace.
My thoughts and prayers are with his family, his friends, and his employees.  I understand that he was not only a great person to work with, but also a great man.  He will be missed by all.
I was greatly saddened by the passing of Steve Jobs.  I remember the days of the garage group and how a dream mushroomed to something wonderful and creative for the world to use and enjoy.   My first computers were Apple II's. In the near future I hope to expand my creativity by going back to Apple and the iMac.     Steve Jobs may have passed but his spirit and drive will continue with Apple not only as a corporation but its philosophy on bringing exciting and innovative products to the world.     Steve was a private person but in the end his very being will always be present to the public for his contributions not only in the computer world but the world itself.     My deepest condolences to his family and to his friends.     Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
As a young college graduate in the 80s, it was always a competition - Apple vs IBM, I remember those days fondly. One of the first 10 people in my company to get a personal computer. I chose an IBM PC but others chose Apple.  Those on both sides had a certain awe and mystique about the "other" machines.  I put an Apple sticker on my PC just so I could like like one of the cool people.  On the outside, I wore a suit, but my inner soul was jeans and tee shirts.  I am so sad that Steve Jobs is gone.  The world will be a less colorful place. 
Steve Jobs is a man whom I never met, but who has shaped my life in so many ways. Outside of the amazing innovation that helped to introduce going all the way back to the mouse in the 1980's and the iPod in the early 2000's, he innovated the way people did business, how they marketed, how they were entertained. His ideas and innovations created a world in which I found joy in technology and became connected to people whom I never could have imagined meeting.  There's a lot of things I want to say and it's hard to say it without stumbling over myself. I can boil it down to one statement: I don't have many heroes or people whom I look up to. I can count them on one hand, and Steve Jobs was one of them. Without him and the other amazing innovators at Apple I wouldn't have found the joy of technology and had a career in it.  Thanks, Steve, and thanks, Apple.
My condolences go out to Steve's family and friends. &nbsp;He was a visionary that set a remarkable precedent for the way we live.  He will continue to define the way we work and play through his  innovative technology and courageous spirit. &nbsp;He will be missed!&nbsp;
I'm extremely sorry about your lost. I have been a support of apple for  years and I have to say Steve was a incredible guy! My prayers go out to  his family and friends. May he rest in peace and just know he is in a  better place free of pain. &nbsp;
There are not enough words to say how much the world has lost today.  A great person, that did and inspired great things.  Thoughts and prayers to his family at this very hard time.
I am not a longtime Mac user. Steve jobs not only convinced me to  switch, but he convinced me to pursue my passion in life. And to share  that passion. Now his death (at my own age) will push me to not lose  time, but pursue it day by day. I am grateful that he has touched my  life and the lives of so many people throughout the country and the  world.
Apple, and by extension Steve Jobs has been an integral part of my   life since I was a young teenager programing computers in an L.A.   classroom working with the Apple II-e.  I was drawn in by the elegance of the Apple II-e (the mouse and the   beautiful 15 color pallet).  I have considered myself part of the Apple family since that time.  The innovations that Steve has given to me through his vision via   Apple has, without a doubt, contributed to what I can say has been a   very good life.  Steve, you will be missed.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs,  If I need to tell others how a successful CEO is, you are the only one. A successful person doesn't need to make a lot of money but make the world better. You definitely made the world better.  I will keep my iPhone 4, which is the last iPhone presented by you.  Thank God for giving us Steve Jobs. No one else could be like you especially your presentation skills.  Rest in peace in God's hands.&nbsp;
I would like to express my sincere condolences to the family.  I am an an Apple fan that has marveled at the products Steve created, which since 2004 has become part of my daily life. This is a very sad for me personally, knowing that Steve is no longer with us.  I always look forward to his presentations when a new product was introduced, and looked forward to what was coming next.   He will be truly missed by people he never knew. Thanks Steve for Apple, and all that it stands for.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs  was an example to all, that the gift of creativity was meant to be utilized to the fullest, and not to be wasted. He utilized every last bit of creativity in him up to the very end  and in so doing left behind for us tremendous gifts and a tremendous legacy.  RIP Steve. 
I really admire Steve Jobs. I couldn't think of a better CEO than him. I work in the IT industry and wished I could have worked under him. He will never be forgotten. His memories and contributions will live on and on. May he rest in peace. 
 Steve's vision and hard work has transformed my world and rest of the world.  Things that we now take for granted and use in our daily lives are his gift  to this world. My family feels the pain of losing such a wonderful person. He, to me, is a l egend who shares the same importance in world as Einstein and Ford hold.  Steve will always be remembered and be part of our lives and his life be celebrated in his work and innovation.  Celebrating Steve's life and work.
As a famous man once said, “it is ideas that mark the forward progress of mankind, not battles.”  Steve Jobs was a man of dreams and visions and made a great difference to our world.  We owe him a lot.  His ideas will continue to live on and grow.   Thank you, Steve Jobs, and we will miss you.&nbsp;
Thank you for connecting us. For entertaining us. For putting a song   in our pockets. For teaching my Mother to text. I love you, Steve   Jobs. RIP.&nbsp;
My respects to all who will miss this uniquely brilliant man.  He has been a hero to our entire family.  Our homes and our businesses thrive on Apple's superb products.  With deepest sympathy. 
My husband and I are feeling very sad to know that Steve Jobs, passed away. Please convey our Condolences to all his love ones and to Apple. May he rest in blissful peace. May he be in heaven. He did the world a great deed and service. I know that, without my iPhone3, I would not have been able to manage thru a long illness and serious chronic pain, along with countless health issues. I will always be very grateful for the innovations that he brought forth. The iPhone is my rescue, during the long hours of pain, loneliness, sleepless nights. It's the only thing that helps me keep my mind occupied, day/night in and out. Thank you, Steve Jobs. We will miss you. May the Lord bestow blessing, upon blessings on your soul, forever and ever. We will alway pray for you. We love  you!!!
  RIP thank you Mr Jobs for  changing the way we connect to our Music and the World! Your visions and  your dreams changed my life made things a whole lot simple from my  first iPod to my Mac to my iPhone thank you and you will surely be missed!  RIP Steve Jobs!            
Steve and Apple have inspired me immeasurably.  For this, I am indebted,  and endeavor to inspire others in my life.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an amazing person and a visionary. He made apple what it  is and it will never be the same apple. 
Steve,  I may have never met you but you have inspired me and pretty much every other techie in the world through your devices, computers and the media. Every year I looked forward to the events to see what you and Apple come up with. I may not own a Apple computer But I do have an iPhone 4 and a iPod Classic, which I wouldn't trade for any other device out there. One day I will have a mac book and look back and think... Steve Jobs was a part of this amazing device and everything else Apple has come up with. I'm sorry to hear you are gone, your are in a better place now and your don't have to suffer from all the pain anymore. R.I.P for Jobs, the greatest techie of all!  --  Thank you
My condolences to his family and the people who worked with. Thank you Steve  for everything. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
For sure you will be in our life forever...&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an extraordinary leader, he had vision, unlimited passion, and a persistence that was unmatched. He took a company that was dying with stocks below $10.00 and grew it with products that were revolutionary in customer experience and features to a stock of $400.00+. Who does that? He will be missed and he deserves his place in history as a visionary that never accepted - it cannot be done - and made it happen.&nbsp;
Dear Family &amp; Friends of Steve Jobs,     I'm so sorry for our loss. Though I never met him, Steve touched my life with his brilliance and technology, and changed the way I communicate. He stayed on the job to the limit of his endurance. He gave everything.    God bless you all.
I came back to my MacBook hoping for a good time on the internet looking up little Apple and tech rumors around the net. When I opened up Safari and went to Yahoo to see some news articles. I saw that Steve Jobs had passed. My heart completely fell down into a terrible mood. I then went to another website that hosts Apple rumors and read a more detailed article. I read the quotes from Steve's family and many others like Tim Cook. And my heart fell even more. I soon began to tear up. And as a junior in high school I didn't know much of Steve when I was young. But when I was introduced into the technology world. I began to look up to Steve and he was my Hero and Inspiration. The news of Steve's death has devastated me greatly. But as a student, I must strive and continue on in my studies to become an engineer at Apple and uphold Steve's legacy. Steve will always be in my heart and will forever be my hero. Rest in Peace my hero,                                                                                          Steve Jobs 1955 - 2011  
  I feel quite struck by the passing of Steve. He was simply a great man and unique visionary.     A fitting memorial would be with the introduction of the Iphone 4S just yesterday, would be to produce a special version of this phone named &nbsp;"Iphone 4SJ".     This would be the best way to remember this great man.
You have made a change in my life. Your words from Stanford Commencement Speech will make a change in my children's life too. These are the proof of your life. The changes in others.  Please rest in peace.
I will miss you Mr. Jobs. Your products have changed my life and brought people into my life that I love and care for. I will continue to support and service macs for as long as I live. Thank you for being such an amazing human. 
Steve Jobs: A great genious! I'm your fan. I'm APPLE''s fan.  God bless you and your family.        
Rest in Peace Steve you were a true revolutionary to this new and  beautiful world of technology.
 Steve Jobs was always an inspiration for me. His attitude, commitment  and vision of the future was indescribable to our mankind. His  determination and perspective into changing the world by techonolgy is  far beyond imaginable. Steve Jobs will never be forgotten, he has marked  his name on Earth in the most influential and positive way possible.  Thank you for everything, we will never forget you. His fight for life  and courage to keep going, it constantly reminds us to never give up.  His long journey is also an inspiration for us that success does not  come easy, you have to earn it and work hard to deserve it. There is so much to say about Steve Jobs, but I think the words that  best describe our admiration for Steve Jobs is, Thank You. You have  changed the world.
I remember when I saw my first apple computer at the age of 7. It was a Macbook that had photo booth running on it. I thought that it was the coolest thing that I had ever seen, but now at the age of 13, I've learned how much more apple means than a computer with "fun little photo programs"! I've been using various apple products with my photography, video editing, and music making. What Steve has done to this company is just plane awesome! Things without Steve will be different, but I know apple can only get better! I someday  hope to work for apple, but until that day comes, you have my full support!
I just wanted to say that my life would not be as rich and simplistic (in a good way) if it had not been for the person and mind of Steve Jobs. The world has lost a truly great entrepreneur.
Thank you. You changed the world for the better. God bless. Blessing of comfort for his family.
Genius.
As a college student currently struggling with my own medical ailment, Steve's determination and resolve through obstacles over the course of his career is a constant reminder of how powerful passion – whether for a lifestyle, an art, or a dream – can be. As steve said, "Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith. I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did."
Rest In Peace Steve Jobs 
 I feel very very sad when I got to know Steve Jobs has passed away. And I want to say no matter who is CEO of apple, I will support apple anyway forever.  I will always remember Steve Jobs. Thanks to him, I changed my life. Now  I am using my ipad2 to send an email just for memory the man who was so great that worth the whole world remember him.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the person who I knew during my time in high school in Japan, and has inspired me in many, many ways with unfathomable depth and gravity.  His speech at Stanford University was the one that encouraged me most to study hard and keep advancing. My first encounter with his speech was in my favourite English teacher's class, and it seemed firstly not really interesting. The more I listened to it, however, the more I was enchanted and inspired to my backbone. I'm pretty sure I was the one that liked and admired Steve most in my class, and I even now continue to listen to his legendary speech as a part of my study of English and the lifelong memorable quote ever in my life. "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish."  As I enrolled in Waseda University and started anew, I gradually forgot the quote. I got tied up with my works and I was about to lose my goals and motives, which was of course created by the quote. Notwithstanding, I now have realized again why I struggled hard to enter the university and what I wanted to do in my life, just like Steve wanted students of Stanford to be, and my teacher wanted me to be.  Steve's death did make me cry. I haven't experienced this kind of sadness in the last 18 years I have lived. He was too great to die and to leave the world behind. I shall never forget Steve and his spirit. I appreciate what "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" means and what I am supposed to learn and what I will do.  My great thanks to Apple that gave me the opportunity to present my feelings and I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences for the loss of the legendary man in the history of mankind.  RIP for Steven Paul Jobs, "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" forever.&nbsp;
Steve, I absolutely sorry about your death, the world lost one of the  biggest  visionaries. Thanks for your contribution to my world.  Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Sad day indeed, His soul was and will always be with Apple, the legend shall  continue to live on !!!
We are truly blessed to have shared our time on Earth with Steve Jobs. 
Such a sad day.  I just want to say you have one of the best client's service and it's probably because of Mr. Jobs and his philosophy.  My sincere condoleances to his family and the Apple family.&nbsp;
All my life I've been listening how great were apple's products and how amazing was Steve Jobs', as a creator and as person. But I didn't have the chance to have a Mac. Along the years, my desire to have an Apple product increased and my affection for Steve Jobs as well. I became a big fan of him, though I didn't have a Mac. So, when I read the news, I got sad, really sad. We lost a genious, a fabolous creator of amazing products and a great person. But, he left whole world of ideas, and above all an example for all the people: Mac or PC, American or Brazilian, Rich or Poor. He left a legacy of love and innovation for all of us. Wherever you are, thank you Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Goodbye, Steve. Thank you for showing us the possible, and that it is so wonderful.
 I only knew Steve Jobs through a succession of Apple products and services from an early iMac, a Classic iPod, a newer sleeker iMac and lastly an iPad2.  Each new Apple that came into my life allowed me to use technology to enhance living without my having to know the technical details or computer language behind the product or service.  Apple and Steve Jobs always kept the end user in mind and recognized that although most Apple users were not computer or software experts they knew how Apple products and services could take their own vision to a higher plane.  My thoughts and sympathy to the Jobs family and his colleagues at Apple.
Rest In Peace, Steve. 
You're at a level of great geniuses of mankind, God has a good place for you. My condolences.
In 1984 I was in kindergarten and took my very first DOS Apple computer  class.  It was a big deal and I was so excited about everything I  learned!  Years later at the age of 34 I am still an Apple girl and  always will be.  I was so sad to learn of Steve Jobs's passing and will  be praying for strength and peace for his family during this difficult  time.
   Thank you for your genius and those great products and ideas.  You have changed our lives...  We will miss you... A lot.
It led to me being cofounder of Shutterfly and several other companies.  And being the first investor in Twitter.  Steve brought me the reality of believing in a new future.
As i Watched iJustine shed tears about Steve and talk about how he influenced her life and changed her life, i thought about what he did for mine. I think he changed mine as well, If not for him, and the rest of the creators at apple, my love for music would not have been as big, music is the most important thing in my life, if i was never introduced to iPods and stuff, i honestly don't know where i would be, it's the only music device i will ever use. I know my story isn't very impressive or anything but i felt i had to share it with the people who inspired me to be the way i am. I will never forget the thing he or any of the other creators have done for me. My condolences for his family and friends, and to all the other people he's inspired like myself.
Please don't let anyone get away without letting America know, that millions of people owe their jobs, as they exist in their current status, with the personal computer that sets on their desks, to the entire genius of Apple's people and Steven Paul Jobs. Many need to know Steve, years ago, was openly honest about the three revolutions he saw in the Xerox lab: the mouse, the GUI (drop down menus), and the computer network. His ability to see genius in others and other people's creations is perhaps, his most hidden legacy. Steve set the tone of vision, inventiveness, and creativity which the genius of Apple's people manifested. All your efforts, Apple, have been a true Blessing on America and the World. May God give Apple and related companies the grace and favor for continued genius and success for the next thousand years. 
I'd like to pay my condolences to Steve's family and friends - a world  of friends, interconnected thanks to the technology Steve pioneered.   We've all lost a visionary. His work made a lot of people's lives  better, and that's what we should all aspire to.
“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”  Thank you for all that you've done, Steve.  The world won't be the same without you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will be missed. He was an innovator, inventor and visionary in our life time. He changed the world just as Thomas Edison did from previous generations. He invented something we didn't know we needed and now we can't do without it. Thank you Steve for your hard work and dedication to making a difference in the world.
Thanks to Steve Jobs. His vision changed my  life. Made it better. Help me achieve my potential. My success.  Thank you.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
    Steve Jobs is gone, we will miss him. Thanks for everything you did. RIP             
Truly apple has lost a great mentor and genius who has become one of the reasons why Apple has succeeded over other biggies. I thank you Steve for being part of every one. You will always be part of us. thank you so much. God bless&nbsp;
From my deep Heart i wish his family/friends in this dark hour all the best.   Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs, you were so brilliant and You have a special Place in our Heart!  My sincere condolence.
Steve, you will be remembered fondly. Your work, your vision, your life  has changed the world and me. Thank you Mr. Jobs for your dedication to  passion and sharing it with everyone.
Thanks for the iphone Steve RIP&nbsp;   
I never knew Steve personally, and I always sort of imagined him as a somewhat Godlike figure; I had no idea what he did every day, had a vague picture of him in my head but no concrete one, and he seemed awesome, but I couldn't know for sure. From what I've read, not only was he an innovative genius with global power, but a pretty cool guy in person. RIP Steve Jobs - the definer of a generation. 
We have now just starting to experience the Apple world. We think Apple  is not just a computer or a music device, it is the whole new level of  technology.  Because of Steve, Apple would never exist. We would like to  say thank you for giving us the knowledge and pleasure to work with his  creation.  We will never forget Steve.   Thank you again!
Thanks Steve.. for all your brilliance..&nbsp;
We Love you Sir Mac! 
My sympathy and prayers for all.   May God grant you comfort and peace.     
I am sad Steve is gone but his memory shines brightly every day.   
I found out about his death on an iPhone.  I shared the news with  friends, and am sending this remembrance now, on a Macbook.  What an  incredible loss.  A brilliant mind is forever gone.  But his legacy  lives on in his company and in the people who use his products everyday.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve for creating such a marvelous company that has changed the  world we live in.  Your charisma and way of presenting products will be  missed, along with your genius innovations.  Every time I use one of my  many Apple products, I will always think of you!  Rest in peace, and my  condolences to your family as well.&nbsp;
Je me rappelerai toujours de mon premier ipod. C'était révolutionnaire et ce fut inventé par un génie. Merci pour nous avoir donné tout ce que tu as fait   RIP Steve Jobs!&nbsp;
It's really hard to listen to this news , I think it's black day for me and for Apple , everything remind me Steve , I'll remember you all my life.
Apple, you have lost a great man. I am so sorry. If not for him, I would  not be typing on my Macbook Pro right now. Thank you Steve Jobs. 
Thank you Steve for bringing new things into our life, not just products, but the way we used them. You will be missed and remembered, not just for what  you did, but what you represent: Life is worth living for.&nbsp;
 Just the other day I listened to a college graduation speech  Jobs made at Stanford a few years ago via youtube. Sitting in the car,  on my way to another groggy day of high school, I was browsing through  some videos and came across Steve's speech. At first I thought, "Well  this will be pretty boring, but I'll give it a try". As I listened, I soon became intrigued with Steve's point of view and story. He was  genuine about what he believed in and what he did, and he sounded like  he loved it. I loved the idea of that. Instead of following "the right  track" and basing my life on what the college counselors and adults say,  I follow what I love to do. My true passion is to become a political  journalist, partly because of what Steve Jobs has said in his speech at  Stanford, and I have to thank Steve for that.  Hearing about his passing  really is upsetting, the world just lost someone of a species that is  truly rare...a man who just loves what he does, genuine love for his  job. Jobs was passionate about his job, and it shined through in that  speech. I give my true and sincere condolences to Steve's family, and to  the Apple community. The world has lost an icon, and a true inspiration  for young adults like me.
Apple has defined who I am and what I have become.  Without Steve Jobs I  would not be the man I am today. May he rest in peace.
I'm a fan from China.I feel sorry for the death of Steve.May he have the pea ce. 
I am so saddened to hear that Steve Jobs passed away.  My sincere condolences to Apple and especially Steve Job's family for your loss.  Steve's vision and clarity of thought  changed the world and has made life much better for us. Thank you Steve.
 It is really shocking for me hear the news. I still remember you hosted the road show for iPad 2. But now we lost you. Thank you for bringing lots of fun and joy to me. And I hope Apple can still make amazing products. Thanks Jobs.
Dear Mr Jobs,  Thank you for your amazing ability to read what society needed and wanted in every inovation you ever created.  My life is better because of you.  RIP friend. 
Steve made the digital world a better place!
Dear Apple,  I am deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Mr. Steve Jobs. His innovation changed my life. I prayed for him and his family. My God bless him.&nbsp;
Don't know how to express my condolences to the Jobs family.  He was one of the greatest men to ever grace this planet. He will be forever missed, yet his memory will live on through his contributions both through Apple and his philanthropic contributions. Rest in peace
Steve was the DNA of Apple and will be a huge void in our lives.  Condolences to Steve’s family and may God rest his soul.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs made that me believe that one man can make a difference.   He will forever be a modern day Aesop's fable for my children.   Rest in peace,
Apple products have revolutionized the way we communicate today. I saw it first hand as I grew up. And Steve was at the forefront of it. He was an inspiration to an entire generation. The world today is a remnant of his vision. &nbsp;I can only heartily thank Steve. The world will sorely miss you.&nbsp;
Dear Friends,   it is a great loss we had to face, when we saw the news on television.   Steve was a great visioner and what we most admired, that he always thought of people and their needs, making their lives more valuable and showing us also how we can think about business and how business can be made.   Passion, emotion, a beautiful mind - we will miss him very much.
I've shed a tear of joy for you my Idol, for you may now rest in peace and  knowing that the world is a better place because of you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a inspiring person who had touched the hearts of  many. His enthusiasm for his work showed a form of caring towards  others. He changed so much of our lives as a whole that it feels as if  he was in everyones family in someway. My heart and especially others of  the world go out to the Jobs family and their suffering the whole world  is mourning the loss of a man with great inspiration and triumph.
I am new to the Apple Family. I work in Apple Retail. Although I have only been with the company since November of 2010, there was a connection to Mr Jobs that is unexplainable. I recall on our 10th anniversary a video played at a meeting to commemorate the occasion. Mr Jobs said something that still rings in my ears.... It's the employees of Apple that make up the special sauce..... Steve built the recipe, he gave us the tools and the resources to make the sauce. My wish is that his vision continues to exceed all expectations. I am in my mid 50's... I work with a a wonderful eclectic group of young, intelligent folks. The brilliant youth of today has found a home, a safe haven within the Apple Community... the demographic is wide and accepting within our walls of white, glass and great lighting. Thank You Mr Jobs, for giving us the bright, the strange, the geek, the nerd, the mom, the retiree a home without bias!    
You are a true visionary and knew what I wanted before I even knew it myself. The energy, attention and love for each detail can be physically felt when using each and every Apple product.   Your talent and magic touch will be sorely missed.  God Bless you and your family, 
Thank you for showing me the beauty in technology, Steve... The world will truly miss your genius.    RIP Steve.
I will never  again worship any leader of one of the biggest IT companies on this planet. Steve Jobs was the greatest. His creations will stand for decades. (I envy you guys who knew him.) He will not be forgotten... Hope the best for his wife and children. May he rest in peace.
I want you to know you revolutionized my life since 2005 and I want to thank you for that... You were part of my trips, my memories, you were and will be always around.  Thank you. 
Thank you Steve for giving us so many amazing things in our lives.  I can say that our lives will never be the same and we have definitely become better because of it.  You have given us the opportunity to grow world wide as an Apple family.  Our bond transcends all race, sex and boundaries world wide.&nbsp;
Steve, i wish you were still here working on the next project for apple. you were awesome and i will remember you every time i click my iPhone on.
 First of all I want to give my condolences to the family Jobs, only knowledge of this great man, his intelligence and willpower to tackle all problems of life, I think it's what his genius technological transfer.
Thank you. Thank you for everything. 
I am just one of the many, many Apple customers, but I want to express my deepest sympathy to all those who lost a friend and family member in Mr. Jobs.  May peace find you all.&nbsp;
I followed Steve and his company from the first days of the Mac and my  first Mac Plus purchase. I always admired the man, his company and the products. I thank him for the products he brought to my home and business. I will miss seeing him at new product introductions.  Gold Bless you Steve!&nbsp;
Thank you for being a positive, visionary, and innovative influence in  my life.  I will do my best to follow your example of excepting only the  best of everything and never giving up at everything I do.  Thank you  for changing the world through Apple.  Thank you for saving Pixar.  You  will be missed, and I am honored to have known about you. One More Thing...        You were the Best.
RIP Steve Jobs - you re-wrote how technology is used and will be used... 
To a man of technology,  to a man of inspiration,  to a man of innovation  and finally to just a great man.  Steve Jobs will be missed immensely.
The world of technology has lost an absolute masterpiece of a genius. A man that is truly the definition of forward-thinking. His ambition, his passion for success and the human heart will forever be missed. A man that taught us that the only way a product could become successful is to merge technology and the liberal arts. Where the immersion of technology becomes magical and truly enriches lives. This day will forever be remembered as the day technology stood still and watched it's leader leave us. Leaves us a legacy to build upon, a vision to continually pursue and give others the opportunity to be great. I believe in his vision. I believe in his spirit. I believe in Apple.  We'll miss you Steve. You'll forever be remembered.&nbsp;
I can't stop crying. Steve is the reason I am where I am. I love you Steve.  What do I say? Steve may God rest your soul peace my friend, my mentor, me  everything.  Apple customer for life 
Hello and my name is Scott. My thoughts are with Steve Jobs and his family. Everyone should be thankful for the life Steve Jobs lived. His ideas, marketing, the intuition of what Apple was capable of, changed lives. Apple is a power house. I remember when I made my switch and it was the 3rd best decision of my life. Steve Jobs knew the need for technology, and had the desire to fullfill dreams, at which he did. Many people in this world have done many great things. Steve Jobs changed several industries in the world with a spark of his brain and the confidence to make it happen. Steve Jobs, you are laid to rest. Rest your body and slow your mind and know this. Apple is the most powerful, the most beautiful, the most advanced computer system in the entire world. Well done.
This is a loss of a true genius and visionary in today's technological age. Its a sad day, and condolences to his family, friends and loved ones. 
I'm so sorry for the loss of such a visionary. Apple will continue to be strong.  Godspeed Steve 
We are sorry for your loss, Mr. Jobs was an amazing human and He will be  missed. Thank you Mr. Jobs for having shared your gift to US all.  Our Deepest Condolences to the Jobs Family.&nbsp;
   Steve Jobs be a symbol of revolution and imagination, create a new world, search to inovation, Steve be the only in the world that change the possibilities, In memory of our SYMBOL, Ipad's Dad. The Man than I believe, The Man than I follow...Steve Forever...In our memories            
When your light is as bright as Steve Jobs it really shines in this world forever.  Michelangelo, Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and now Steve Jobs leave the world a better place.  Condolences to all.&nbsp;
A man with vision and guts!  What a wonderful contribution to the world!  His memory lives on as does his work albeit from a different dimension.  RIP and work from above pain free and with continued purpose.
The life and death of Steve Jobs illuminates the profound effect one   person can have on the lives of untold others.  As a loyal Apple   customer, my own life would be incredibly different without his   brilliant contributions to personal computing and communications.    Please convey my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and   colleagues.
Now i'm using this MacBook and typing these sentences with sorrow. R.I.P. Steve Jobs. Thank you for giving us the products that we can never imagine.&nbsp;
  An enormous loss made less painful by the wonderful way he changed our lives. I choose to&nbsp;remember the images of a youthful Steve&nbsp;when he showed us things we never dreamed of.&nbsp;
 From my first Apple II thirty years ago to the Macintosh on my lap   right now, Apple has been with me for most of my life.  Thank you   Steve for sharing your life with all of us and enhancing our lives   through your vision.&nbsp;
From Lima, Peru. My condolences to the family and friends, for the lost of one of the greatest genius of the world.
Upon learning of Mr. Steve Jobs death I became sad and emotional.  Our small company recently migrated to all Apple products both behind the walls of our office and in the operating rooms delivering care to our patients.  Without Mr Jobs vision and determination such wonderful life giving instruments would not have been developed.  Steve I admire your passion for making a difference in the lives of this world.  Such a shinning example for all of us to follow.  "We have but one chance in this world, when opportunity presents itself to help and assist our fellow man, seize the moment, embrace the struggle with passion and never quit while striving to accomplish a difference".  May God's light of peace shine down upon the Jobs family and friends.&nbsp;
   Well, sorry if my english is bad, im from Venezuela, and well, i think that Steve was one of that persons that changed our worlds :/ in so many ways, id never knew him, i never will, but i just know that the world has lost a great person and a brilliant mind, our life its so easy thanks to his inventions and ideas! Its hard to believe that this happened! but well, hes better now! At last he’s resting!               
I was fortunate enough to live in the US as a child when my mother went to graduate school, the first computer I laid hands on was an Apple IIe and it changed the way I perceived the world. Now I am 38 and father of two children who cherish Steve's vision, we as a family enjoy all that Pixar has created and both in home and work rely on and savor the idea of using our Ipad's , Iphone's, Ipod's, MacBook's, Mac Mini's and Xserve.  Thank you Steve, your genius, your ability to think outside the box, your willingness to push the limits have made our lives much better and have pushed the whole industry forward.  We hold your memory close to our hearts 
Steve, with your brilliant talented gift this world become much much better than we thought. Deeply thanks from the bottom of my heart.
The life of a machead, a devotee, has not been an easy road to travel.  Engrained early in my life was a love of all things Apple.  First, my Apple II+; then, my mac SE.  I remember Steve leaving the company, and how hard of a struggle it was for those of us scattered throughout the world, still clinging to the hope that Apple could see through its dark days.  Meanwhile, Steve was out there, developing his NeXT computer.  When he returned to Apple, it was, quite literally, the Return of the King.  Trumpets heralded his return.  At least in my head.  That he was able to take Unix, his NeXT model,  and Pixar into this century are testaments to his dedication and visitation.  I will always cherish my Mac Cube, most of all.  It had a purity of design, and the coolest power button ever.  That was all Steve.  I am glad I have stayed a machead my entire life.&nbsp;
   The most beautiful wreath to change the world giant! Great sorrow! Relatives of grief! 
The world has lost a creative genius, but has gained a brilliant angel. His  family and friends are in my thoughts and prayers. Steve was a brilliant man and the world will never be the same without him. Thank you Steve Jobs for everything you have given us. I've only ever owned Macintosh products and will never go to anything else. You will forever be missed.&nbsp;
I'm sorry to hear about Steve; as it will be said many times over, he truly changed the world and he will forever be missed.  Steve, through Apple, revolutionized the way we do everything, from making a call, to chatting with family and friends, to telling the story of people all over the world through video and music. He made the computer personal in ways that words cannot describe and for that we shall forever be grateful.&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs.. Although I did not personally know Mr. Jobs, he have  inspired me to be great. Thank you for changing the way I listen to  music, talk to my family and friends and making my job easier. You are a  visionary that will be missed.
I am deeply sorry for this huge loss, as a loyal apple fan and user this  is truly sad day. My condolence to Mr. Jobs' Family and Friends. 
This is to his family:  I am very sorry for your loss. Steve was a great man. May he live on  forever in your hearts.
What do I write? You were an inspiration to me. You completely changed the way I approached everything.  I found myself quoting you without realizing it, not because I knew everything about you, but because the few times you spoke it was so meaningful. You have changed my life more than you will ever know and I hope I can in some way impact the world as you did.  My condolences to your family.&nbsp;
Anybody who knows me knows that since my purchase of an Apple Lisa computer - the forerunner of the Macintosh - in late 1983, I have been a devoted customer of, and yes, stockholder in Apple. I frankly would not want to count how many Apple computers, iPods, iPhones, etc. etc. I have owned in the last 28 years.   These products have been for me more than just tools or toys or gadgets. I can honestly say that much of what I have accomplished in my life has been directly connected to how, in the words of Apple marketing slogans, they encouraged me to "think different(ly)" and gave me "the power to be your best."  Today's passing of Steve Jobs isn't just the loss of another corporate CEO. Most of us don't have a single original idea in our lives. A handful of people have one original idea, and enjoy great success. Steve Jobs literally changed the world four times: 1) He is, at very least, the co-father of the personal computer and its reinventor with the Macintosh; 2) His ownership of Pixar has led to the most staggering string of high-quality, critically and commercially successful animated movies in history; 3) The iPod and iTunes have radically changed the way virtually all of us listen to music; 4) The iPhone and the iPad have defined mobile computing and communications for our age.  Steve Jobs had the power to dream with his eyes wide open, and in his own words, skate to where the puck was going to be. He changed our world and our lives, even for those who have never used an Apple product. And in an era when so much seems to be broken, he gave us all a glimpse of what it is like for something to "just work."  The world won't be the same without him.  Ralph
Put the Think Different tag line on his home page picture. He certainly belongs with everyone else in that apple ad campaign 
The world will miss you Steve.  I'll never forget the joy and opportunities that you and your company have given to me.  My sincerest condolences to the rest of the Jobs family as they go through this very tough time.
An inspiration to billions.              
Steve Jobs he was Apple. A visionary that will be truly missed.  Our condolences to his family. 
Steve you changed my life.  You'll be greatly missed. 
you have touched me with all your works and principles in life... you amazed me on how you stand in all your downfalls...  you move me with this statement...  "I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.  You’ve got to find what you love.  And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.  Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.  And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, KEEP LOOKING. DON’T SETTLE."  thank you steve jobs.. may you Rest in Peace... you'll be remembered FOREVER...&nbsp;
<div>I'm feel terrible. &nbsp;My condolences to the family and Apple. &nbsp;I very sad about this. &nbsp;I can't believe it.</div>
I'm truly very sad to hear the news.  I have never met Steve but I know how much he loved life. I just watch on CNN his video in a college graduation and it made me think about my life and how to make it better for me and those around me that love me. He will always be remembered. May God be with his family and his coworkers.&nbsp;
Thanks for being you!  In an era dominated by corporate and organizational systems, where individual creativity and responsibility have given way to collective and irresponsible systems, you have been a shining light; a beacon of the supreme power of the individual, the artist, motivated to change lives, irrespective of the maddening crowd.  I only hope your were not the last of a kind ... Take care. 
You were a visionary! You made the world change!  God bless you!
Steve has been an inspiration to so many who he never knew.  We all   loved him,  his creative mind and how he made life so easy for us with   his products.  My son worked for Apple, and based on his training   (help the customer to buy what they need and not what they think they   want),  says volumes for the integrity of the company.  My family is   sadden by this loss and for his family and those who were close to   him.  We will pray for all of you.
I would like to offer my condolences to Steve's family, friends and work colleagues.  While I never had the opportunity to meet Steve personally, I am more than a ware of the way that he changed the game. Steve was an innovator and knew how to get things done. Apple have lost a visionary, a true genius.  Steve brought about many changes in the computing world, we all know what a mouse is (thanks Steve). We all know what an iPod is. Many people own something he had creative insight on.  While Apple will continue on strong, I hope they are able to continue on stronger knowing that Steve's memory will never be forgotten by all those who ever purchased or used an Apple device. The proud, the humbled and the grateful.  Thank you Steve, my wishes are with everybody who knew this wonderful man.
My heart is filled with much sadness. I am so sorry. He will live on in  our lives for many many many years.  
Thanks to you I liked computers when I was 8 years old. Thanks to you I confirmed I wanted to get into IT back in college. Thanks to you my life is simpler. The world has lost one of his biggest.  Thanks for everything.&nbsp;
When I was 3, my father bought our family an Apple II+. It is the only significant thing I remember about being three years old. Now I am 35 and my daughter is 2. Her first words were 'ma' (as in more food), followed by 'mommy/dada', followed by 'iPhone'. What a profound effect Steve Jobs and all of Apple have had on my life and now on my daughter's life. Keep up the great work Apple and please keep breathing life into Steve's vision, your vision.
He was a great man! He changed the world of the tec. Thank you for all! I remembered the speech in Stanford, what a great speech and knowledge of live! THANK YOU FOR ALL THE GREAT THINGS YOU HAVE DONE FOR US!   R.I.P STEVE JOBS!
Thank you for the vision and courage.   
I've only been an Mac user for 3 years, but in that time, Steve Jobs influence on Apple products and technology has changed my life.  Today, my career is centered around developing software for devices Steve helped bring into the world, using technologies he introduced us to.  I owe my success to his inspiration and his vision.  Here's to the crazy one.&nbsp;
I remember how happy I was when Steve Jobs returned to Apple Computer to resurrect it. When the the iMac came out, I jumped at the chance to help promote it working as an in-store rep. Steve changed everything and we will always think different because of him.&nbsp;
On behalf of my family, please accept our sincerest condolences.  Steve  Jobs will be remembered as a innovator to the technology world.&nbsp;
The world has just lost a genius, he was amassing, the creator of many  great things and a legend. &nbsp;I WILL REMEMBER STEVE JOBS!!  
Steve:  I am sad to hear of your passing, you brought so much joy and light into this world. I have been part of your vision from afar.  travel well brave soldier you will be long missed and never forgotten.
Thanks for all of the incredible technology you shared with the world. Your entire story is the American dream in action. I am inspired by your dedication. It reminds me of how I can do anything with my life and make a difference  in the lives of others. You will be truly missed sir.
My thoughts and prayers are with Steve Jobs' family. He was such a visionary and had such an impact on this generation. Despite being one of the millions of the users of the devices he created, I felt immensely sad and a sense of personal loss at his demise.  May god rest his soul in peace.
You will always be remembered in our heart, for generations to come. Rest in peace Steve. Lest we forget. 
Thanks Steve for improving my life and showing how friendly a machine can be. 
I can only feel myself grateful to be a user of your work. Thanks for sharing your ideas. Now you are immortal.
Good Bye... Mr. Steve Jobs... You are our Inspiration..... We lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world lost an amazing figure...  Once Again... We always remember you in our heart...
What a sad day for America, the world, and for technology.  Having worked in the technology industry for years, I have always had a great appreciation for Steve's vision, design, and ability to build such an iconic company.  He will truly be missed.
My condolences goes to the family of Steve Jobs. May God Rest Him In Peace.
I just became an Apple-holic and will think of Steve Jobs and his vision each time I use my new Apple products. His passing is a loss to the world but his legacy a gift to the world.  My sympathy to his family and friends.
His live change my life and life of my family as well as all people I know     RIP.
Thank you Steve, thank you! You've been the example that with courage determination and passion dreams come true. Rest in Peace!&nbsp;
 You changed my life, made it better! Rest in Peace, Steve.  Stay hungry. Stay foolish.&nbsp;
Thank You, The World Is Better Because Of YOU ! 
  My deepest condolences to the Steve's family and the entire Apple community.  He is already part of this select group of people who transcended and that changed the world.  The memory of Steve is on every one of Apple products we use every day.  The world has lost a genius.
Steve Jobs you rock. You made the world change for better with your products and May you rest in peace.
I had to save my money for awhile to buy my first (functional) home computer in kit form.  I then had to save my money once again, to buy an Apple II+ when they became available.  The Apple II+ was not my first home computer, in fact it was my third, but it was my first home computer to actually be generally useful, while being intrinsically thrilling.  When the Mac became available I had to save my money once again.    It's been a great experience. Godspeed Steve.  
You were a great man, a great genius. I will miss you.
i have never felt technologically adequate, from being a 5 year old kid  who had trouble adjusting his skates to a teenager finding the  carburetor on his vw beetle, but years ago when i jumped into the abyss  and bought an apple computer i followed the printed page inside the box  explaining the four steps to become a "user." &nbsp;1. take computer out of box. 2. plug into the wall. 3. plug in keyboard  (picture provided) 4. turn on computer. &nbsp;From that day forward i have considered myself technologically capable. thank you Steve Jobs and may you rest in peace, though based on your  past, there will not be much rest but energized times for you and those  in your new existence.&nbsp;
What a great visionary. We will miss the whole man and his wonderful genius.  
RIP Steve Jobs thank you for changing our world for the best.  We will miss you forever a real HERO. Words can't explain how sad and how proud I am to have lived through a moment where you made things easier for us humans.&nbsp;
Heaven is a place nearby, so there`s no need to say goodbye.  My great innovator, Steve Jobs*Have a good dream and till we meet again&nbsp;
I know this just a little message, but this sent from my deepest heart, One dreams I wanted the most is to see you on the keynote on some WWDC,  LIVE, someday Even I know it would happen anymore, you've greatly inventing many lifechanging things for this world, And we are greatly and deeply says many thanks for it, Apple wouldn't be an Apple without you, and all the things that we used in this life wouldn't be the same if  there's no Apple.&nbsp;
An incredible visionary that will be greatly missed. Thanks for everything Steve.&nbsp;
I'm greatful for your gifts and my children will benefit, thank you for sharing, it changed my life so many times.
I didn't think I would feel very affected by Steve's passing. But, as I rushed to my powerbook and saw the news I was moved. This man that I had never met or even slightly knew had changed part of my life. With his vision my profession exists. Graphic Design will forever be indebted to this great innovator. Thank you Steve, I am able to be a freelance artist and a stay at home mom because of your work. My prayers go out to your family in this time of great loss.&nbsp;
I'm so sorry to hear of Steve's passing, he was one of the very few people I have idolized. He will never be forgotten.
Mr. Jobs, thank you for lighting the way and making my life better.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is an inspiration that will live in our hearts forever. He is a mentor and inspiration for not just Apple Inc., but the  whole world. He has left us inspired and showed us the way by leading us from what-is to what-can-be.&nbsp;
  Gracias por todo Steve, pensaste diferente y cambiaste el mundo.      Descanse en Paz.&nbsp;
Steve, thank you for giving an entire generation the power to be their very, very best.   So few have impacted so many. 
I'm so sad. After only a week of using my new MacBook Pro, I already understand how  you made this world different, and better.  thanks for everything.
   I heart goes out to the Job's family and friends after hearing of their loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;I have been an apple consumer since 1984 and have followed the company since then. &nbsp;I feel a great loss, even though I have never met Mr Jobs, there is a connection to the company and he was the company. &nbsp;It is my hope that the next generation of apple innovators will share the same passion that Mr Jobs had shown and that I try to obtain everyday....because of him. &nbsp;  
RIP Steve Jobs,  Best Regards and Condolences to all the Apple Family.
Thanks for open our "i" minds to the dream worlds. Fly to the infinity and beyond Steve.&nbsp;
 Thank you not only for your innovations, but also for your wisdom on life that you generously shared with the world.
The very first computer I ever laid my hands on was an IBM compatible  running Windows 3.1. For me then,  I thought that computer  was so  fantastic and awesome. Then when I became a Fashion Illustrator, I was  introduced to the Macintosh, a Quadra 950 to be exact...everything then  changed for me as far as desktop computers are concerned...everything is  so intuitive, easy and gives me more freedom to create! As I became more  fascinated with the Mac, I got to learn more about the two  Steve's....specially Steve Jobs. Not only was he the face of Apple but  he has this simple brilliance in combining sleek design aesthetics and  latest computer innovations...No wonder I later  became a Graphics  Specialist for an Apple Disitributer....kudos to you Mr Jobs...rest in  Apple heaven!  Thank You for all the memories!&nbsp;
I'm really sorry for the world's lost, Steve Jobs was my idol and i'm very sad because of that I will pray for his soul every day              R.I.P STEVE JOBS. YOU WILL BE ALWAYS ON OUR MINDS  
 Hi Steve....u change my life....have a nice trip...thank you bro...R.I.P.
To his family and friends, all my love, and light. I'm so sorry and so  thankful to him. English is not my language and feelings are hard to  express. May God be with you.
RIP Steve. Thank you for all that you given this world! You will be missed.&nbsp;
I think there is no words who can explain the hole he left in this world, like person, like visionary, like an awesome people, we will miss you... rest in pace...
Hi,        I´m four years older than Steve. I´m engineer. Since I was young, Steve was present in our lives through the development of marvelous products.     The world will remember him like a visionary and a genius and one of the most important personalities in the development of IT.
You changed the lives of many people around the world and consequently made the world a better place. You will be remembered for many generations to come . If the world had more "Steve Jobs", the world would be a much better place. Thank you so much for everything you did for mankind. I am sure mankind will never forget you.
Our deepest thank you to Steve for his ingenuity and vision.  I....we thank you, and believe in Apple.&nbsp;
I don't have word to say what i feel but i know that the world lost an excepsional person!!  Good bless steve jobs.
Thank you Steve for everything. May your soul rest in peace.   
  I never knew him personally, but I received the news with deep regret. Surely a man who saw beyond the horizons with a brilliant mind and revolutionary. In his dictionary of words, impossible, certainly not exist. He certainly was a milestone in technology, marketing and the power of both together. Thanks to him we now have devices that are not "just devices." It really changed everything. The iPhone can not be classified as a cell, it is much more than that. After all, an eloquent person, friendly, and someone's sure to be remembered forever. I have no words to say how sad I am to receive the news. My feelings to family, and God help you in this difficult time. Mr. Jobs, great man, great person, and again .... Brilliant. Great loss for humanity, for Apple and for all his fans, like me, who always admired his ideas totally revolutionary. We will miss his magic touch in making the impossible possible.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for being an inspiration.
I just read the news and my immediate thoughts are: Prayers for his family and enormously large circle of people who called Steve Jobs "friend". Realizing how privileged I am to have been on the planet during his amazing influence. Saddened to think we have lost him. Smiling at the inspiration that he will continue to be for generations to come. Just a 48 year old little geek living in a little mountain town.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs,  Thank you for changing the world of computing and mobile devices. We will miss you.
 Friends.. im not the most fanatic of apple... but im a iPod fan!!! i'm really sorry.. Steve wasn't a man... he was a Genius!!! this is a sad day.. but all of us have sad days and... there is only one medicine against sad days.... it is Music... and Music for me... is iPod.... thanks for the iPod Steve!!! thanks!!!!!            
Steve- You're genuine pride in Apple was contagious, it was my pleasure to do business with you and your company in the small ways that I did.  Rest in peace. &nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs. Thank you for changing the world. A sad day, but your legacy will influence how we experience our lives forever.
There are very few "celebrities" who, when they pass on, leave me with the feeling that I have lost something dear. Steve Jobs is one of those very few. In fact, the world has lost a man who was a true visionary, a man who helped many of us love technology. I have been a Mac user since 1985 (Mac 512K with a 400K floppy drive), and today own three Macs, two iPods and an iPhone. More importantly, I recognize the creative genius that was Steve Jobs. He created products that I have loved. I can't say that about many people or many things. He will be dearly missed.
We will miss this incredible man. Tks for all the technology and work  you did for the world.&nbsp;
Dear Apple, Today you lost a friend, a companion a genius and someone you will never be able to forget in you lives. Today we all apple fans share this distress with all of you. We know you'll never be able to have someone as him but at least you can get someone that makes the company happy and profitable. Even though we never met him, we know he was a great man with enormous dreams and a great vision to create what is Apple today. He truly succeeded on his goals and still today we know the company will continue to succeed. We share this day of sadness with you. Steve will be remembered all around the world. Love, A huge apple lover. 
Steve, you are the real genius of our days.  May your spirit last forever.  Rest peacefully in heaven.   Your loyal follower.
Steve will always be remembered not only as a visionary and a driving force in innovation for technology but an individual with passion who will always be an inspiration to all of us in the tech industry. The world will not be the same anymore and many of us have the challenge to try to fill in those impossible shoes he left behind. I hope everyone in the world understands the huge leap one man created in just 56 short years of life.     My deepest condolences for the family who can be assure they where amazingly lucky to have lived with a GENIUS. I'm humble to have known in my life of an existence of one man who change and inspired everything and everyone.     May you rest in peace my friend Steve Jobs!&nbsp;
My condolences to any loved ones of Steve Jobs,  In US history in school, instead of learning about irrelevant wars and the history of some "american hero", Steve Jobs should be in those text books that we students learn about. We should study how a man of humble beginnings revolutionized the world. Rest In Peace Sir Steve Jobs, earth's greatest mentor.&nbsp;
We live on in our children; Steve lives on in his technology - so many of us carry a part of him in our pocket, have a part of him on our desk, lap and in our lounge room. Steve put a dent in everyone's personal universe in so many ways. CEO's from large companies rarely stir the emotions of their customers - Steve is even unique in death.&nbsp;
As a teenager growing up with during the age of such growth in technology, Apple products have always been revered by as almost sacred by my peers, and admittedly, me. The new iPod, iPhone, and Macbook are always a point of discussion, as well as the genius that came behind it. What kid in America these days hasn’t used an iPod at least once? To say Steve Jobs greatly impacted my generation is an understatement. At least half the class had chosen Mr. Jobs when we were asked to write an essay about an influential person in contemporary times. He will continue to be a legend in the hearts of all of us youth, as an inspiration of innovation and creativity. Thank you, Steve Jobs. May you rest in peace. 
To Apple and Steve Jobs's Family,   Steve Jobs was a great mentor in many ways. His philosophy of technology  inspired all of us. His visionary and ideas of creativity live on, especially in the company  that he truly loved. Steve will be greatly missed by many people and he will be always in our  hearts. May our thoughts and condolences go to Steve's family and God bless them  during this hard time of great sorrow.&nbsp;
English is not my first language although I have lived in the country for long time. I have tried to say many things about this sad moment, but none of them came to what I really want to express accurately. I am just sad as I told my son, David, who broke this sad news to me. I just want to say to Steve that "Have a good journey continuing on, Steve!".
 Rest in peace and thank you for all your hard work and for all the technology that you made available to humanity.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. You've always been an inspiration.   
Hey Steve. I know you're no longer with us, but I would like to say that the  world is a little bit emptier from now. The world lost a visionary like no other, who spent his entire life to make other people's lives better with his  brilliant mind making innovative products. we will always miss you. R. I. P.
Steve remains forever with us. Just look for the APPLE LOGO!  There you will find Steve. Our world has been blessed by his brilliance and devotion - He has touched MILLIONS and MILLIONS of people around the world are inspired because of him. Jobs family - Know that the world celebrates Steve's life and grieves his passing, but you are his life and loves, Peace to you.
The innovator of Apple will be sadly missed by billions as he helped sculpt Apple into one of the most innovative and outstanding companies of today. I know I will light a candle for the great man. Thank you Apple!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the Tony Stark of our day.  He was a Golden Rod in the midst of copper wires.  He was a true visionary, innovator, and an awe-inspiring human being.  Steve Jobs will always be remembered for the colossal impact he had on the way we use technology.  Rest in iPeace, Steve Jobs.  Thank you for your contribution to humanity.  Thank you. 
  Rest in peace Steve Jobs. You will be remembered forever.&nbsp;
There are no words to explain the loss and fill the void but his presence and spirit lives on in the way he mastered technology to enrich our very way of life for the betterment of mankind.
Dear Steve,    I have been working for your company for two and a half  months now and was so excited to work for a company like no other  company in the world.  Our products that we sell put smiles and fill our  customers with joy and excitement.  To see customers play on their first  Apple product puts that excitement in me.  Knowing the products came  from a person like you; you must feel that enjoyment any where you go.   If this company didnt have you we wouldnt be where we are at today as a  company.  You will truly be missed from this company, customers, and me.   I and the rest of this company will still bring the excitement that you  want coming out of this company.&nbsp;
A man who made a huge difference to my life and to those of countless others. He truly changed the world. Condolences&nbsp;
I will be using Jobs' legacy for the rest of my life, as a game and  animation artist, i more than have a deep appreciation and Love for what  he's given me. I am truly sad for that he couldn't live forever, the  world needs someone like him, he is who we should all strive to be. 
Steve Jobs inspired me in becoming a better person and a harder worker. He has forever changed all of our lives and he will always live in my heart. Thanks Steve for being such a great inspiration and a person.&nbsp;
You have given  "wanderlust spirit" credibility.   
You changed my life, for which I will always be grateful.
I’m from china.I just want to say :Your spirit will become a great light for our generation.leading us to better life.although you’ve never been here,on this land.You will live in our heart ,forever. 
Dear Steve,  A simple message to acknowledge brilliant man who "conceptualized, simplified and changed the world we live in".  Thank You, You will be missed
Thank You Steve for being such a driving force of creativity and innovation. Thank God for sharing such wisdom among us and showing us how to dream!
It took me a Ramayana and Mahabharatha to realize that GOD can live on earth, and unfortunately now it took a SteveJobs to realize that GOD can die ! "iTunes iPod iPhone iPad and therefore U r with us always StephenJobs" !&nbsp;
Hi,  I have never talked to Steve. I have never spoke to him. But still, he  manages to influence my life. With his brilliant mind, he has inspired  me to never give up, to think differently and challenge the status quo.  Please send my respect to Steve Jobs. You will always be my hero.&nbsp;
Thanks for All.  All IT in the world are crying 
To Mr Jobs family and friends,  Like many, I was saddened tonight to learn about the death of Steve  Jobs. We lost someone who revolutionized the world as we, or at least I, know  it. My first computer was a Mac Classic, that I still own to that day.  Not only the products created by Apple but the vision of this man and  the company he built shaped so many of the things we use on a day to day  basis. People using Apple products learned to "Think Different" and I  try to do that everyday. I'm glad I got to live during a time where I  could see the body of his work and vision come to life. My thoughts are with his family and all those who feel saddened by his  death.
Steve,   Thank you for being a great human being, you are an inspiration for many. Thank you. 
The world is a sad place today without Steve Jobs.  He has touched the world and we are all better for his time on the planet.  He was an original and will be remembered everyday by millions of people who use the products that he created.  Taken too soon.&nbsp; 
 The world is now divided in 2 parts: one before Steve Jobs and another after Steve Jobs.   Steve you were a genius! You contributed so much for the world.   We will miss your brilliant and revolutionary ideas.   Rest in peace, genius!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs,  A man of the past, forever a visionary of the future.  The upmost respect, and thanks.  Rest well.
Rest in peace, Steve :-(&nbsp;
Once a Brazilian singer said  "it is weird... The good people die first."  As a teacher, I'd like to thank you for CHANGING the world Mr. Jobs.
We have lost a great innovator, a visionary, a true creative genius, and a great human being. He will truly be missed.  insanely great! 
So sorry to hear about your loss.  Mr. Jobs was a visionary and brought a new level of technology to our ever changing society.  He will be missed and hopefully his legacy will live on for a long time to come. 
From my first Apple 2C in 1981 to my IPad 2 I purchased this year I have felt like a part of this company. Apple has always been so real to me and Steve seemed so reachable, dressing in blue jeans like I do. I will always be an Apple customer and I am sure that the innovations and dreams of Steve Jobs will be carried on forever.  I'll miss you Steve RIP.
Steve is my role model. I strive to be as much like Steve in my approach to business as I can, as well as in my ability to think outside the box. Thank you Steve for everything you've taught the world.
Steve Jobs was a real revolutionary. One of the biggest and kindest. We  will miss him but he sure changed the way we looked into the future. RIP.
It's difficult to talk about a person I've never met, yet I still feel  the sadness like i've lost someone who is close to me. I believe we've  all learned something from Steve in different ways, and continue to  appreciate his genius. Steve has left a massive footprint on this earth,  and we should all be grateful that we were around to see it as he made  it. I pray for his family, and friends. I think we should find comfort  in knowing he's in a better place.
So saddened by the loss of Steve he was a true visionary and brilliant man whom I looked up to and was inspired by. 
Steve Jobs what can i say? a man who changed the world a man who changed technology. a man who changed the way we live. a kind man. a generous man, but most of all a man Who changed the way we think. a role model for millions. He made us THINK DIFFERENT. so i send my condolences to jobs and apple and to his family. RIP jobs i just know you are having a blast in your icloud. that is steve jobs  
Steve Jobs and Apple have revolutionized technology, from the iPod, iPhone, iPad, Mac, etc. He has given the world a way to connect to each other in ways which 20 years ago were only talked about. I admire Steve Jobs for what he accomplished during his tough battle with cancer. He will never be forgotten.
When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. Live your life in a manner so that when you die the world cries and you rejoice. * Native American Proverb - Steve, you became the inspiration to many people, including myself! Rest in peace!
 Steve Jobs is the man.  He still lives on through his inventions. 
Dear Steve,  You were a truly amazing person. You innovated to world of computers, mp3's, phones, and tablets. Apple will never be the same without your creative mind, thinking of the next "have to have" product. You will truly be missed by me, and many of my friends.
Thank you for everything you have done steve. You are truly an  inspiration to us all. 
Thanx a lot mr Steve for all your life shared with us,your many helpfull inventions, your life example, thanx for share your thoughts with the world All my best wishes and condolences, and a lot of light in your next path,some  people inventend some single things, Steve Jobs invented a new world!&nbsp;
Mis mas sentido pesame para la familia jobs, y agregar que era el mas grande en cuanto a la tecnologia, y creo que lo vamps a extranar mucho todos aquell os que eramos unos verdaderos fans de apple, descanse en paz "Steve Jobs"&nbsp;
Thank you for showing the world what is possible and being an exemplary pers on, whom we all should respect and emulate! I truly hope your family is doing as best as possible! Thank you again!&nbsp;
I'm really sad to hear the news of steve departure... I'm from puerto rico and  apple has changed my life... Thank you steve jobs. You're the man. We'll always remember u...&nbsp;
Steve will be missed to people like me, that never meet him in person but that were fortunate enough to use the products he envisioned.  My condolences to his family and friends.&nbsp;
We, here in Brazil, are very sorry for this great loss.  May God receive his soul – surely Steve will figure out a way to improve and revolutionise Heaven’s web experience.&nbsp;
OMG a good man has fallen, you will be greatly missed. rest in peace 
Although not well known Steve Jobs, the news of his death shock me thoughly.   Steve, as one of the most greatest men of this time, will be memorised forever by the people on the earth!  Respect for Steve and Apple, 
I'm just a kid who attends Rutgers University. I never knew Mr. Jobs personally, but I didn't have to, to understand how amazing he was. It's shocking, but I am actually crying because Mr. Jobs has died. There was so much more life for him to live. So much more to do, to make this world a better place. Steve Jobs you will never be forgotten!!   R.I.P. Mr. Jobs, and long live Apple!
 Steve Jobs was the most genius man of the 20 and 21 century. Our sympathy goes out to his family and friends Sent from my iPad 
You have my deepest sympathy for our loss of one of the greatest  innovator, genius in our time.  Steve Jobs will be missed. 
a terrible loss to the world it is , Rest In Peace Jobs, I just wish if I could meet you for 5 minutes , but I guess that would have to wait .....To jobs' family and friends : stay strong , smile every time you see some guys gathered around checking out something with a bitten apple on it's back , Steve was there&nbsp;
There is a heaviness to the air today in our Brisbane office…a stunned silence.  We are indebted to Mr Jobs for so many things, it will be years before we know just how much…and will we truly be able to appreciate it?  I think not.  All of us here send our deepest condolesnces to Mr Jobs family, friends and colleagues.  May he forever be at peace.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,  I think I was especially emotional because I felt that Steve was "taken" from us.  When a person could have so many more years with so many more contributions to the world left within him, there is a true loss when his life is cut short before his time.  That said, there is no question that he has had an incredibly rich impact on so many people and the time he had on earth was full of meaning.  I was thinking about how he really had a deep commitment to making great products, and really cared about quality.  And his vision democratized computing for multiple generations of creative people, which forever is changing our music, art, design, and film.  Thank you Steve for what you have brought to this world, and I really wish you were still here.
Steve,   I appreciate the opportunity you have given me to work along side you. As a specialist, your influence was felt everywhere. You will be missed. Rest peacefully.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs was indeed one of the most brilliant minds of this days... Im really sorry that he passed away. My sincere condolences for his family, friends and co-workers.            
To the family, friends and colleagues of Steve, you were blessed to have known such a visionary and amazing human being. We should all be so fortunate. I wish you peace knowing that he is in a better place, joy in the wonderful memories you shared with him, and prayers that time will heal your sorrow.  Rest in Peace Steve. You will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
My thoughts to Steve's family right now.  Sad, sad news. 
Steve has set the standard on what quality and taste means.   Everyone in this world will want their children to have that kind of taste.  This is actually a beginning (although sad) for the US. This is going to inspire the US to get back their edge  His impact is going to be bigger now than ever.&nbsp;
Thank you for creating beautiful useful tools that are so essential to   my everyday life.  Apple and Steve Jobs will always go hand in hand.
Never got the chance to meet the brilliant creator but I would like to   thank him for all he has done for so many many people. He will never   be forgotten! My condolences to his family, friends &amp; loved ones. His   memory will be with you forever. God bless.
Steve has made a company from nothing to the most valued company in the world. In the last 10 years he has revolutionized Apple, he will be missed and from myself to all the team at Apple I wish all the best and I hope you continue the great products you continue to bring out. I hope that every new product you bring Steve will always be honoured. God bless.
Mr. Jobs was a brilliant business man, creator and innovator that we can all learn something from even in his absence.      He has had the kind of impact that makes almost anyone feel a little empty on the news of his passing.      Rest in peace Mr. Jobs           
I didn't know Steve nor have I ever owned an Apple product but I am truly saddened by this news.&nbsp; I'm praying for his family.&nbsp; He appears to have had a nice heart and pleasant spirit. 
Sad, sad, sad, sad. But what an amazing life. Truly of an example of  what it means to do your best.&nbsp;
I have always found Steve jobs to be a fascinating and inspiring person. His foresight into the technological universe has truly changed the world. Steve was one of those people that only ever so rarely comes along, and you just have a sense of how extraordinary they were. Even though I did not know Steve personally, his passing deeply saddens me.   I extend my deepest condolences to his family and friends.&nbsp;
What an incredible person.  Few people can make the lives of so many so much better and productive. He will be missed.&nbsp;
Thank u Steve for all...the world had lost a genius ...we will love u  forever!!! Rest in peace.... Ciao...
It's seem to be the saddest news of this month. I use Apple because of you, I love the way you attract people and show them what Apple is. Really, i still can't believe now you've gone. My son cried when he heard you will leave Apple and he was disappointed when he didn't see you in "Let's Talk iPhone". I got the same feeling. You are legend Steve, Mr. Magic. Good bye Steve, you are always the best!! My idol, rest in peace, I love you, I love Apple!! 
 Thanks Steve. You Will be in my heart and mind. You changed my life.&nbsp;
Absolutely the best leader and visionary. Love Apple with all that I am.  I'll miss seeing Steve giving keynotes.  Thanks for everything Steve and Apple&nbsp;
My most sincere condolences to all the Apple community, and to Steve's family and friends. We'll miss him deeply.&nbsp;
My condolences to the family and my sincere wish that Apple will  continue to be what Steve wanted it to be.....the best.
R.I.P. Steve Job. You were the greatest inventor in this world. Your products transcend everyone on this planet. I loved your ipod and I will be getting an iphone 4s to remember you.  The world will miss you. I will miss you. You are an icon and represent the best of my generation. I shall and always remember your greatness. I am very sad today to hear you have pass away.  May you go to heaven as it deserve you! and you deserve it.
We are the proud owners of iMac, MacBook, iPad, two iPods and two iPhones!   We appreciate your brilliance and all the wonderful products you have created.  We send the deepest condolence to Steve's family.  Rest in peace...&nbsp;
My heart goes out to the family of Steve Jobs, the employees of Apple and the billions of people he amazed, inspired and impacted.  Apple has been a part of my life since the Apple IIe.  I will truly miss his creativity, leaders hip and vision for making technology more personal.
Thank you for changing the world with your courage, insight, vision and dedication. You definitely left a lasting impression on the human race, and your name and memory will never die. You will be missed.&nbsp;
I would like to express our deepest condolences&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for all you've done to make our lives just that much better - the world would be far different without the vision and innovations you have championed.&nbsp;
Steve.  Good bye, no one will fit your shoes.  When another genius like you appears in this  world, I know will be god, you are god you are  forever, do not forget your computer, you will  need it to keep innovating, heaven will bless  you, you bless me,  windows will freeze my pc  and you will not be here  to help me, bless me  on my ciber future.&nbsp;
This is equivalent to my mom's generation of Elvis dying for me. I am very sadden and emotionally moved at the moment. He was more influential on my life than my parents and friends. While my parents loved me and friends shared fun times. Steve influenced me, motivated me to become the innovated, creative technologist I have become. I got into computer technology in 1980 and moved to Silicon Valley because of him. I have been one of his biggest admirers and looked to him as a mentor to push the boundaries of my own creative abilities to develop technology solutions which I hope made a difference and impact to the industries I worked in. We've lost a significant influence and icon in technology. We won't see another person of his innovation and foresight within my life time. He was the Edison of technology. He was and is one of my biggest inspirations.  I feel I have lost a close family member
Dear Steve,  As much as I was a strong believer in using Windows everywhere for any  reason, I have to admit, I have been converted. I own a MacBook and I  absolutely love it. I've owned several iPods, and now, I am very glad to  own an iPhone 4. Personally, I think the iPhone 4 is the most innovative  technology out. The way it feels in your hand, the slimness, all the way  down to how rugged it is, yet classy. Your inspiration will be missed,  and that sincere smile you have when sharing your creation with the  world will be remembered. I always looked forward to the Keynote  presentations you would lead and the new and amazing technology that was  presented in the show. Thank you for your innovation and your amazing  mind. No matter what people told you, you always seemed to say to them  "It can be done."&nbsp;
I just  wanted to say that Steve jobs inspired me to want to become an Apple  employee. It is my dream/ goal to work at Apple.
I'll always miss Steve. He was an inspiration for me to do the best I can and more in everything I did. He was the person that I looked to when I wanted to "think different." A true legend in creativity and business combined has been lost today and there will never be another person like him. Thank you for helping me to where I am now, Steve.
Steve, You have never met me, but you profoundly influenced every aspect of my life. Your products and the software that drives them are merely manifestations of your philosophy and approach to life.  I love Apple products, but I love more what they represent. I am an orthopedic surgeon and I have modeled my personal practice philosophy after what Apple taught me: less is more.  Steve, I will forever be indebted to you and will never forget you or what you brought to the world. I can only hope your brilliance will continue to shine through the people you have touched.   You are already missed.&nbsp;
RIP Steve.... Thank you so much for your wonderful innovations, you are trul y a revolutionary leader.  Thank you for making technology so much more user -friendly and so useful for our lives.  Our hearts go to your family and loved ones.... iPeace......
I'll never forget the first Apple II+ I ever saw... felt like it wasn't even real... life changing... even though I struggled through some of the less good years and struggled to pay for the gear as it got more expensive, it always came back to that good ol' Apple II+. Won't ever forget your efforts and thank you for them. I trust the rest of the team will keep things going in your absence, but I guess in that way you aren't really gone...
Thank you steve for all you have done for the world. You have been and  will continue to be an inspiration to all.  May your onward journey be peaceful.
Thank you for taking features to intuitive benefits.  Thank you for merging  art &amp; business.  Thank you for allowing me to avoid tech support for a decade.  Thank you because you pushed the brilliant &amp; enhanced  the everyday user.  Thank you for drawing us all in...
It's with a heavy heart that I wish to convey my condolence to the Apple company and Mr. Jobs family. His genius will live on into the next millennium.  Thanks Steve
He just worked.
My inspiration for life was through Steve, and that I WILL NEVER FORGET.&nbsp;
Leave in peace Mr Jobs. You've changed my life.&nbsp;
The sky is the right place for him.
I feel like I've lost a good friend. It is a sad day, but all of our lives have been made better by Mr. Jobs. I would like to call him Steve just because he has been a part of my life since the mid 80s!  There will only be one Steve Jobs, but his influence may hopefully inspire others to try to follow his lofty goals. I would like to wish his family all the best in this time of grief. With time, that grief will hopefully be tempered with the immense pride in being a part of his remarkable life! You are truly so fortunate to have been so close  to such a great human being. My life would be completely different without Steve Jobs and not just because of his devices, but in the work that I do every day. From the bottom of my heart, thank you Steve!  My heartfelt condolences and best wishes!&nbsp;
I have been using Apple Products from the very beginning. All the items were designed with the user in mind. Steve Jobs was a visionary person who has made a huge impact in the world of  information technology. He will be deeply missed!&nbsp;
Steve, thank you for made my life this easy.  We will never forget you.
My heart goes out to his family: A Man can create whatever his mind sets upon. A Man is not a Man without Values. A Man takes technology beyond human scopes. I called that Man Steve Jobs. God Bless to all.
Dear Steve,  Wherever you are now, I hope that you can hear the outpouring of   affection and respect of the millions of your fans and mine. You have   given us so much opportunity with your products and ideas.  As a follower of the Apple dream from as early as 1984, when I was   working for the Apple advertising account in Germany, I have been a   supporter and fan. I had the good fortune to meet you in your office   in Cupertino in '84 and it was then that I got a glimpse of the genius   that you have been all these years.  Rest in peace and I will never tire to spread your gospel.&nbsp;
Sad to hear Steve's departure. May God bless his soul!  Mr Steve - You will be missed! :( :( :( 
I am so glad Steve Jobs was with us. I grew up with apple products and love them. We miss you. 
Dear Steve, You redefine the technology. You recreate the animation. You reinvent the phone. You rebuild APPLE. You brought us so many amazing, elegant masterworks. You definitely changed this era and affect the world.  Thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
God bless Steve Jobs.
I am grateful to be an admirer of Steve Jobs.  This human being, with his geniality, gave to world  creations that only he could. It is a great lost. I pray for him and I miss him.   
I spent my morning on apple.com watching the videos about your new iPhone4S and thinking what a great job you did explaining a new story again.  I was curious how you would honor Mr. Jobs' death.  What a great picture and what a great and simple tribute to a great and simple man.
I am very sad today hearing of the passing of a genius whom has contributed so much to the improvement of our creative lifestyles.
I still have the 1st mac I purchased from apple, mac 84 .  It was bought  at the 1st apple reseller in Alabama (no apple stores at that time). It  still runs word and excel. THANKS TO MR JOBS FOR MAKING A COMPUTER THAT A THUNDERHEAD LIKE ME CAN  USE. I pray for his family and to all of the apple family world wide.He has given apple a good foundation and his legacy will be  impacting  the business world for many generations to come.&nbsp;
Courage to fail and succeed.    
I've never enjoyed a place of employment as much as Apple nor have I so sincerely considered making a job into a career. Thank you for believing in doing something better and different.&nbsp;
 My sincere condolences from Venezuela to the man who revolutionized the world of technology, the entire universe is with you people Apple.
R.I.P. boss.Thanks for making it possible to run your entire life with just one, simple, pocket-sized gadget. And a big thanks for providing me employment in a store with the best team of co-workers!
We lost a genius... the world will change since today.&nbsp;
Jobs the Einstein of this era. RIP hero.
Steve jobs is just amazing. I just can't think of anything else to say. All I can say is Rest In Peace, Steve Jobs, and I am now iSad. 
Us in Cupertino are in shock. Even though some of us are only thirteen, Steve has changed our lives and inspired us. RIP. 
There are probably many people writing for you right now, but I just want to  let you know that you were an amazing person. Even though I don't know you very well, you always inspired me in many ways. Please rest in happiness as the world says good bye to you. May everyone remember your dear name and remind us that we live in this world of technology based on your thoughts. Rest In Peace.  
Dear Steve,  I grew up in a world where there were no computers, no internet, no email, no connectivity or information sharing. My kids don't.  You and other brilliant people made the world different with computers. YOU made the world different by insisting on a higher quality, on better products, on creating the wave of change. You made the difference by creating, losing and coming back and creating and winning again. I can tell my kids, there is no limit, there is no failure- look at Steve Jobs. The world has lost someone really special. May your soul rest in peace knowing that you've done so much for so many. Our thoughts and prayers go out to your wife and children in their profound loss.&nbsp;
I've always been inspired by Jobs and Apple... I thank him for so much because I know without him none of this would have happened&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will live on as one of the great all american icons. When we  think of Apple products we will always think of Mr Jobs.  My condolences  go out to his loved ones.
Unique and admirable person. Huge&nbsp;loss for the entire world.  Missing Steve...&nbsp;
You changed the world. You changed my life. I'll never forget you.  
You are forever in the hearts of humanity! We love you! 
I am absolutely devastated at this loss. He was a great CEO and extremely talented man. Our thoughts are with him.
You have given the world the greatest gift of all...Happiness. No one could bring the world together like you.&nbsp;
It may seem a bit odd that a Freshmen in high school is paying his respects to such an important person as the one the world has lost recently, but when I  heard the news I felt my heart drop a little bit inside of me.  As a fifth grader, my class was instructed to do a biography on a significant person. Mr. Jobs was on the cover of magazines across the world with the debut of the first iPhone, and I knew on whom I was going to do my biography. Ever since studying this truly important man who has revolutionized the world in which we live today, I have been in awe of him and have said to myself on multiple occasions: "Wow, I wanna be like him when I grow up."  Now that he has passed, I feel like there is a void in everything I have known to come and appreciate regarding all things technology. In retrospect, however, I realize how great of a legacy he has left behind. Now more than ever, he will inspire many people to follow in his footsteps.Thank you, Mr. Jobs. You will be forever remembered and respected.
Such an amazing gift had Steve Jobs.  I remember using our only Mac   Classic amid a sea of Apple IIe units, and marveling at the wonderful   touches... that the design(er) seemed to anticipate needs, wants, and   the comfort and convenience for the end users. It takes a strong empathetic mind to be able to create something that   could satisfy and touch such a diverse user base.  Truly a gift from   God to Steve Jobs, and ultimately, to us, the body of Apple users.  To all who knew and worked with Steve, my sympathy for your loss. Certainly, his spirit will live on through the marvelous works of his   mind and hands that Steve Jobs shared with us all.&nbsp;
Steve,  You changed the world and my life is better for it.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
I think I finally know how my Beatles-loving friends felt the night that John Lennon died.  Steve changed the world, not once but multiple times.  I'm devastated that he's gone but I'm grateful that I lived in the time that he d d.  Almost every part of my daily life involves a product that his genius touched.  Farewell, Steve.  The journey truly was the reward.&nbsp;
We have lost a great artist ... Rest in Peace
im deeply saddened with the news that steve is now gone. i never had a  chance to meet him personally but still i can feel his love trough his  apple products. i'm inspired by his handwork and genius. someday i will  surely meet you in iCloud! i love apple and i love you steve!
I will be in awe of steve jobs and what he accomplished for the rest of my life. i'm one of the millions of people who loves apple because of its design, its ingenuity, and its thoughtfulness. Mr Jobs lived his life with spontaneity and adventure, and for him, that meant realized brilliance.  i will always be inspired by his example. &nbsp;
    As only you you did, simple and clear.  Forever ... Thanks Steve!  
 A snippet from my first Mac Review in 2006 should say how I feel ...  "...My only hope is that Steve Jobs and his incredibly talented team of passionate engineers design and manufacture just about everything that we use everyday including computer accessories, LCD TVs, cellphones and even toasters and eventually our homes themselves. Hell, why not!.   Finally I cannot write about this and not talk about Steve Jobs. What a life this guy has lived. 30 years of unflinching and uncompromising passion to deliver great products. Even when the "chips were down". And this adulation coming from a veteran PC user...I guess I have a transplant myself now besides the iMac...and perhaps that is a good thing and long over due :-). "&nbsp;
Steve means "inspiration" to many entrepreneurs. He is remembered as  just not as a genius but an excellent human being. May he be blessed  with divine light and divine peace.&nbsp;
Steve is truly one of the most inspiring American's of my lifetime. He  will be insanely missed.
Mr. Jobs... a job well done.  May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve, RIP.....you were the GREATEST.
Steve was genius he is my mentor i love the things he has designed and made they are just amazing  REST IN PEACE STEVE YOU WILL BE REMEMBERED!! 
Steve Jobs has truly made this world a better place.  Today is a sad day. 
You are an amazing inspiration to all. You changed the world and now the world will never be the same without you. Your legacy will live on forever. Rest in Peace Mr Jobs, you will be missed.  My sincere condolences to Steve's family, friends and all who had the honour of working with him.&nbsp;
Today, more than one star shines in heaven. And a very bright one at that. Steven Paul Jobs is it. As everyone knows, he made the technology revolution. He will be part of world history. All speak, and say: this really is an example of a person. This is a warrior. This is Steve Jobs. 
My condolences are towards everyone who knew Steve Jobs and had him as a  family member, friend, coworker, and even those people who just bought  his products. I was one of the people who really did not know much about  him personally, but I think back to the small flip phones and thank this  man and his company for creating my iPhone 3GS and iPad. This is a loss  like no other, and I am praying for everyone involved.&nbsp;
Mankind has never known a man like him, with a lost like this, we feel like the world is now walking slower, even knowing that i´m wrong, but that is how it feels like!  Steve, now is your time to rest in peace, take with you the sure that the world is thankfull for everything that you've ever done! Thanks for everything and we'll meet you some day! May god be with you!&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  The tools i use to compose this email have been envisioned and realized  by your team under your leadership. It is one thing to have a vision and  then another to be able to see that idea through to fabrication and  commercialization. I think it is safe to say that you have perfected  this art.  Congratulations on your success in business and for setting an example  for future generations; whilst technological progress will have  stuttered in the very short term as the technological industry finds  their feet without you, it will surely grow exponentially as the legions  of entrepreneurs and engineers work more inspired than ever. On this  note, i'd like to congratulate you as well on becoming a successful  human being - this is the greatest achievement.  Thank you for making our lives a lot more comfortable.
My deepest sympathy to the family of Steve Jobs which includes his   immediate family and extended Apple family.  I am very thankful for   his innovation and dedication.  May he rest in peace.  You will be   greatly missed and never forgotten, Steve Jobs.
Nunca tuve un iPad o un iPhone o un iPod... pero se que gracias a Steve Jobs es uno de los artífices del mundo tal y como lo vivimos y disfrutamos ahora...Gracias por todo al genio que cambio el mundo...Hasta siempre al gran hombre que vivió sus sueños con esa magnífica filosofía de vida.
I feel like we've lost the mentor of all mentors.  I came to Apple about 1989, and always knew that no matter what, the passion for the best lay within Steve, a person I never met, but had so much respect for.  I just ordered a new iTouch for my daughter, and I'll share with her how sad I am, but so grateful for what he did, and the groundwork he laid. Thank you Steve, and, thank you to all the thinkers, and doers, at Apple. I've always been, and will always be, a supporter.  God bless.
The physical world has lost Steve Jobs, the "tech" John Lennon. As  inspiring and revolutionary as Lennon, Jobs was also centered,  innovative, creative and communicative, and gave us the gift of  simplistic connectivity just as Lennon gave us the gift of poetic  peace-driven verse. The spiritual world has gained a new member this  evening, one who will live each moment fondly, chasing love and passion  to infinity and beyond.  Thank you for sharing your words during your 2005 Stanford speech. I,  like millions, have watched it countless times on YouTube and took your  message to heart. It has impacted my life for the better.
A great lost of the world. To be remembered forever. 
<br>
Steve Jobs was a true hero. He fought for the same world that I fight for every day. His innovations gave us a glimpse of the world and how it ought to be…how it can be. He showed us that that world is possible, and that it is such a wonderful place. I paid the market value for his products, but his efforts are worth much more to me. He lived by no standards other than his own, and he never lowered or compromised them for anyone. He loved his life, and my life is so much better because of him. I feel like I lost a friend today. Thank you, Steve Jobs. Rest in peace.
Apple family, I know your hearts are broken.    
Steve Jobs has been a great influence on my life and so many others.  My prayers are with his family and loved ones.  I will never forget the impact that Steve Jobs has made in our World! My son was the 2nd to tell me of the sad news, my husband was the first. I have always wanted to work at Apple, Steve has created an organization of caring individuals. Just last week I interviewed with Apple in Woodland Hills, CA and then heard the sad news today of such a great loss.  I am deeply saddened by the loss of Steve Jobs. My Prayers are with the friends and family of Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs changed my life in 1984.  That was the year I first tasted what a good user experience could feel like.  I owe my career in interaction design and my life of creative expression to Steve Jobs.  Thank you, Steve. You will be missed.&nbsp;
I just want to start off by saying your creations have changed the world  today. You are the reason why so many companies evolved technologically.  I was the biggest fan of apple since the iPod. But after you came out  with the new apple computers, i've fell in love with your products even  more. I've seen every speech of yours and realized that you don't do this  for the money. You do this for the love of creating something newer and  better. Your energy, enthusiasm, and love for your fans will always be  remembered. Rest in peace. 
Steve Jobs was a man of the people. Knowing what the people wanted and actually taking the initiative and giving it to them in the finding of Apple. Never giving up, always looking to innovate, God Bless You Steve Jobs for your life's work.&nbsp;
  Thanks so much for the hard work and all of your creativity. I love my IPhone and I love you.  The world will miss you so much!!!&nbsp;
What an amazing impact he has left on the world in the 20th and 21st century!  It is hard to imagine that anyone could match his accomplishments, at least in my lifetime. Keeping him in my thoughts and prayers...&nbsp;
So sad!  Rest in peace Mr. Steven. I'll alway remember of you. 
 An inspiring creative genius, whom we all felt like we shared something special with.&nbsp;
May Steve Jobs rest in pease. May his family find the strength to deal  with this moment. We will never forget you. ALL MY LOVE FROM BRAZIL  
Our deepest Condolences.............for our Legend Steve Job.........you  are our hero for me and my Family.........you are our inspiration, the  world of inpiration REST in PEACE STEVE.........See You in Heaven&nbsp;
Above all my deepest condolences to Steve Jobs family, thanks for making  people think outside the box, thanks for sharing your ideas with us.   See you in iHeaven!
Growing up as a kid in the 60's and 70's I never would have even dreamed that technology could be what it is today.  I remember getting my first AM transistor radio and thinking how amazing that was with the one earpiece!  Steve Jobs made my kids world a whole lot better than what I had as a kid.  Thank you Steve Jobs for my iPad, iPhone, iMac, and iPod.  You made it possible for all of us to have extremely cool communication devices, our music at a  touch, and you were just an all around good guy. Thank you for how you changed my life and have inspired me to go after my dreams and if it's not out there, then invent it.  You are an inspiration to me and will always be.  God bless your family and I pray that they are comforted by the Lord.&nbsp;
i am very sorry, it is very sorry. He was a genius. such a great person.
Condolences to his family and colleagues.   May his genius and insight into human factors live on in the company.&nbsp;
My thoughts go out to your family, they can be safe in the knowledge that you built a great company which will continue to create great products, which will be enjoyed for generations
I'm sorry. Truly sorry. The world needed him longer. You guys who are left need to carry it on. Improvise. Innovate like he did. And choose the most charismatic showman you've got for the presentations. It doesn't have to be the  CEO- those are big shoes to fill and it's a hard job.  The rest of us will be rooting for you as we mourn the passing of a giant.&nbsp;
Dear Steve......  Yesterday, Apple was not the same without you...It never will be...ever again....  May you rest in peace....And may you attain Nibbaana...  The World, will never be the same without you.... 
Thanks for all the magic.    RIP Steve   
Thanks Steve for the cool products and great topics for discussion between lovers and haters of Apple. Many memories for the digital history of the world.
 Steve Jobs was an inspiration to me. And all I ever wanted to do in my life was to meet him....
I was a big fan of Jobs and. I belive the tecnology would not be the same without him.   He revolutionized the computer science and technology!  He was a big man ,a genius and a hero and will stay forever in history !  God bless! And he rest in peace seeing that all he created!               
I just want to say that I loved Steve Jobs. He was truly a visionary and a brilliant man. He has brought so much to the world. I know that he is in a better place and not in pain anymore, but he will be missed badly. I just can't believe our Steve is gone. Thank you Steve for creating such joy in so many peoples lives. My prayers are with the Jobs family. I will miss you Steve.&nbsp;
Steve,  I dream of what more you would have created for humanity had you been given more time with us, yet the inspiration to dream of a better world that you have given each of us will remain forever. Thank you.  Rest in Peace.
My deepest sympathy goes out to all of you, Steve Jobs' co-workers and  his family. I started using a Macintosh over 25 years ago and have never  looked back.  A creative genius, an unparalleled visionary, a great man.  May he rest in peace, and may his legacy endure.
Irreplaceable, was a great mind. I always love it!&nbsp;
I will miss the man who had the vision to move all of us non-computer   folks away from the command line language of C:\  to the use of the   mouse and the most beautiful operating system in the world!  God Bless!  
Steve was  my inspiration, my guide. With his ideas  i can do so many things for my  patients! I will really miss u Steve.
Dear Jobs,   Yesterday morning, Apple gave us some new presents - iphone 4s and ios5 and so on, but this morning, we lost you!   You are one of the best gifts that the God for the world!   You wanted to changed the world, and you have changed the world! So when you leaving, you must be smiling!   I am remembering you in China! Thank you for your jobs to this world!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was one of the great minds of our time.  He will forever inspire; living on in the hearts and minds of those that choose to innovate  and create.  Steve was an everlasting asset to humanity and will be incredibly missed.  Thank you Steve, for "thinking differently".
Steve  Thanks for all you have done !  You have inspired me as a small business owner to think differently and to focus on the end product and make it as client centered as possible. I am in the financial services industry and the end product is really my advice to my clients. I believe that advice and the deli very of that advice has been positively influenced by you.  I am sure Walt Disney is welcoming you home for some great discussions. I will not say the words "rest in peace" as I know you did not like to rest . . But may you be at peace.
I have been a Windows user all of my PC life but the genius of Steve Jobs cannot be ignored. His vision has moved computing into new realms and future computing will forever have his fingerprints. 
To the immediate Family of Steve and the entire Apple family Worldwide,     My thoughts and prayers are with you at this unhappy time.     Blessings&nbsp;
Today is a very sad day.  Steve Jobs to me was the greatest inventor and innovator of our time.   I have been a loyal Apple customer for about 10 years and I have   personally converted many friends and colleagues along the way. It was   Steve's creativity and attention to detail that captivated me and drew   me to Apple. I personally was not fortunate enough to have known him   but I feel as if I did. I am very sad and my thoughts and prayers go   out to his family.
The world will never be the same without you.  Thank you for everything you have given us.  iBelieve. Rest in Peace my friend.
Steve Jobs had changed the world, and had changed our daily life. I want more Steves in this world. We miss you.
Just want to say thank you  
We have lost Steve. Nonetheless, he still survives in our life always. We love Steve.
Thank you Steve Jobs. I have been a Mac user for 25 years and owe my entire career and success  to Steve Jobs' innovations, creativity and vision.  Of course many of us loved and praised what Apple offered and Steve Jobs  philosophy of what was possible many years before the explosion of  iProducts.  I am happy he saw the potential of Apple become the icon it is today,  but very sad for the loss of a great man.  My heart felt feelings and condolences go to the Jobs' family.
We always remember his vision, creativity, energy, this is a big lost for all the word. Steve.. we going to see you in iClouds! RIP The biggest visionary of this era!!!&nbsp;
The world has truly lost an unparalleled visionary. Someone like him is  a person that will be remembered for decades, if not centuries, to come  for what he has done in so many areas. I remember racing classmates in  elementary school for the Macs to play Brick Break. I grew up with  movies like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and Toy Story 2. I continue to wait  anxiously for their next movie, even as an adult in my mid-20's.&nbsp;To this day, I love my Apple products and wait baited breath for the  next revolutionary device/software to show what devices can truly  achieve.&nbsp;My thoughts and prayers go out to the Jobs family and those  fortunate enough to call him a friend.&nbsp;
Thank you for the lessons of life you have left to us.&nbsp;
for your creativity vision, for your attention to detail, for your ability to fuse art/science/technology into amazing products that changed the world!  Regards
Steve,  You will be missed. With my first job doing tech support for Apple, to now supporting the International Space Station as a Mac Expert, you have helped pave the way to a better way of life, more ways than you can think of. You have changed the way the world views technology. Thank you for all you have done. You will be missed, but your legacy will never fade.  RIP boss.
Steve you single handedly took the world by storm with brilliant unique ideas. My dream is to work hard in school and then work for apple in the future.  Thanks for everything you have done for apple.&nbsp;
May Steve's work be forever remembered.  I pray that he will be with Apple in spirit and that his company continues to innovate and stay competitive in his honor. &nbsp;
Thank you so much to Mr. Jobs for all the joy that he gave and will continue to give to me with all things Apple.  I am saddened that he has passed away at such a young age, but oh my, all that he accomplished in his short years is extraordinary.  He was a man with an incredible mind and a kind, giving heart.  I send my sympathy to his family and friends.&nbsp;
We did not know him personally, but Steve Jobs fundamentally transformed the world, leaving behind a true legacy.  All of us[ average people ] can only dream of affecting the world a trivial percentage compared to Steve's success.  Underneath such a celebrity figure was a normal man with an everyday life who pushed his ideas and aptitude onto others directly and indirectly by his revolutionary concepts and innovations.  We are sorry to lose such a perspicacious human being.  He will always be remembered by,  Everyday, Average, Mac and iPhone Users 
As I start my new career with Apple tomorrow, I am loosing a great  leader and inspiration at the same time. Steve was one of the reasons I became such a huge fan of Apple and its  products. My condolences go out to his family.   Rest In Peace Steve!&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for all the entertainment and for  help us to be more close of the world.  You were, an important part of the tecnology development.  Thanks again for your input.  Greetings to your family and closest friends, from Colombia,i will lift a pray to God for strength and comfort them.  RIP , Steve
My condolences!    To Steve Jobs family and the Apple company, the world have lost one of it´s greatest visionaries and a great entrepreneur. R.I.P&nbsp; My own motto,  It´s Better to Burn Out, than to Fade Away! 
This is why i write. 4 years ago i decide to embrace the fact that  design was my path. Over the years i thought that Apple was just over  valuated and that it was not necessary for me to embody my dreams. About  2 years ago i couldn't help it and i bought my first mac ever, from which  I &nbsp;am writing  this email.  Steve Jobs was from that moment one of my  inspirations. His work, his vision of the world and the way he helped us  designers to conceive our creations will always be cherish in my heart  and in my professional life.  I hope Apple will continue the amazing  road steve, as a cofounder of this enterprise did until the last moment.  RIP Steve Jobs. Thanks for everything.
I don't know what I could say that someone else wouldn't say better. Other than thank you God for sharing him with us and allowing us to benefit from his life's work. We are truly blessed. Apple lover and user since 1994.
Thanks Steve Jobs for changing the world. You have made a big difference that will echo throughout the history.You will always be remembered. May you Rest in Peace. 
Steve,   I deeply regret your early death. The way you were, was inspiring, stimulating, passionate, and thats why I will remember you with happiness and emotion. I hope you always be happy, and in peace.&nbsp;
Sir, you will always be remembered for generations to come. Thanks for all the outstanding products.&nbsp;
You will be missed and every time we use our Iphones, Ipads, or Imac we will remember you and thank you.
Steve,  You created history around the world.  When I was growing up Coca Cola united all of us, today it's the i-phone  Everytime you introduced an idea or a product it felt like Christmas!    Thank you for all the attention to detail and design.  Having my first i-phone in my hand felt like holding a precious   jewel.  And your first Mac with the rainbow Apple sits as an art piece.  I am so proud to have lived to hear you, see you and be part of your   legacy. You will forever be remembered.
I had the opportunity to work for Steve at Apple and NeXT.  He not only  was an incredible leader, but also a caring individual.  I am amazed at  how many people he mentored through the years.  I will miss his passion  not only for products, but also for people. 
Just now during news on CNN about Steve Jobs' death,  my daughter said "Dad, I wanna watch Sponge Bob on Apple TV." He would've liked that I think.
Steve.. you have changed the way we live and communicate with one  another. Your legacy will live on forever. Thank you for all that you  have done. I am truly sad that you are gone. I know now that you are no  longer suffering. RIP 
I remember those old blue computers. I called them Blueberries. Not sure  if anyone else did, though. I still have my first ipod. It brings back  so many memories. Apple is an amazing company. Thank you, Steve Jobs,  you will be missed.
Steve Jobs has been my idol, my muse and my inspiration. I am grateful to him for all that he has given me and shown me through the years. May he rest in peace knowing he changed the world and the lives of so many that live to be original, unique and to push the boundaries of all that is possible.  
Lamento tu partida. Celebro tu vida. Hiciste de este mundo un lugar mejor.&nbsp;
Condolence Greetings,  It is unfortunate to see a man of great vision, with an incredible amount of power of innovations  that revolutionize the today's and the likelihood of foreseeable future of transformation of computer technology died, however his jobs, especially his lasting legacy will  forever and ever remain. May his soul rest in perfect peace. &nbsp;
I never met Steve Jobs, although I did work for Apple for a few years and was on campus when he was. There is no way to measure the immense impact Steve Jobs had on this company and the widespread influences he had not only in personal computers, but music, film, the way we listen to and purchase media and most recently the entire phone industry.  Only Steve Jobs could have taken a company near bankruptcy in 1997 and made it the most valuable company in the world. Nobody can ever replace this genius, but alas, he has a company whose veins runs with his DNA. Apple will continue to lead the world in innovation and genius, just like its founder. We will miss you Steve, one of the greatest visionary geniuses of our time.&nbsp;
I remember my first computer an Apple Performa back in 95. I remember becoming a fanboy from the first days in Graphic Design class. I remember all the heated arguments with friends, colleagues and even bosses about the Mac's superiority and how I wasn't going to work on anything but a Mac.  I happened to fall into fixing the mac's at an old job and maintaining two servers. I unwillingly became the Mac teach, event getting a Mac cert. I now manage a large website for a great organisation and if it wasn't for those experiences I wouldn't know half of what I now understand about computers.  Thank you Steve, the technology industry has lost it's shepard.&nbsp;
You changed my life.   
Though I never met you, you have change my life so much. Lots of my friends work at Apple and they are the happiest people I know. You are a true Jedi master! Thank you for all you have done in our lives. &nbsp;
 The world has lost one of the most creative minds today.  He has  inspired so many of us. Everyone in the tech industry dreams of making a  difference to  the world, in the same way steve did.  May his soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
Visionary leaders give all their energy to this world - give themselves away... they are so dedicated and committed to making this world greater.. they work so hard that sometimes forget about taking care of themselves... this world did not want to lose you at 56, Steve. Thank you, for all the good things that you have done for us.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve, you changed the lives of many of us with you gifts.  I type  this message from one of those gifts, the iPad2.  You will be long remembered!&nbsp;
I am so saddened to learn of Steve's passing.  It's strange to realize that you can feel such a loss for someone you never knew.  Having said that, his genius touched the lives of so many, and I suspect many people also feel that they knew him in some way.  At a time when so many of our corporations lack true leaders, Steve Jobs stood in such stark contrast. His passion, his commitment, his drive, his creative genius, and his striving for perfection will be admired for many years to come.  To his Apple family, you have very big shoes to fill, and I wish you all the best and hope that you take great pride and find true gratification in pushing yourselves to take Apple to the next level.&nbsp;Thank you to Steve for sharing your genius with all of us.
People say the difference between a man and a boy is the price of the toy. A new Apple Product always brought me this childhood feeling again. I will always remember this.  Please keep it alive.&nbsp;
I heard about Steve's death on the radio just a couple of hours ago, it left  me feeling totally gutted. The world has lost a true legend. My thoughts go  to the family he has left behind during this terrible time of mourning.
He will be dearly missed as an amazing visionary, my heart goes out his  close family and friends, who will miss him even more.
I so fondly remember my first Apple product. I drove frantically 70 miles after work one day to the Keystone Apple Store in Indianapolis just to purchase my first Apple computer - a PowerBook G4.  I waited first in line on campus for the release of Panther throughout Snow Leopard. I couldn't wait to see each WWDC. Every release was so exciting.  I enjoy all technology, but there has been something really special about the last few years and Apple.  I never knew you, but felt close. I'll miss you Steve.
I think that God needed to innovate heaven so he called on Steve Jobs to challenge the norm and make it more intuitive...
 May he be blessed and stay happy ever after!
My sincere condolences for this loss. Steve was a great man. We'll remember him for all he did. &nbsp;
Thank you for everything that you did for both technology and usability, you always had the vision to keep moving forward when others would've taken two steps back.  Your insight will be sorely missed.  Thank you for everything.
The greatest inventor of our time. I'm so grateful to have witnessed   his "genius."&nbsp;
Beyond the gadgets, beyond the technology, beyond even the cool factor of the products, Steve Jobs was a creative genius and the kind of person  who could look at something, see the problem, and formulate a beautiful solution.  What an inspirational character!  Rest in peace, Steve, Apple will  keep the light on for you.&nbsp;
Such an amazing visionary! A company build with solid principals...   Build an amazing produce and take care of you customers and they will   be forever loyal!
He will never be forgotten  If only there were a few men like him this world would be different &nbsp;&nbsp;
I WISH YOU STEVE, GO WITH GOD I THINK THERES DIFFICULT CHANCES TO THE  WORLD HAVE ANOTHER STEVE. DESEO QUE TU STEVE, VAYAS CON DIOS YA QUE LE HAS DADO UN GRAN AVANCE AL  MUNDO, YO PIENSO ES DIFICIL QUE LOGREN REMPLAZAR A STEVE. BUENA SUERTE APPLE Y STEVE.&nbsp;
I think everyone has been touched, in some way, by the vision and technological advancements of Steve Jobs. In our family, we have two iPhones and two iPods and can hardly wait to upgrade to the newest technology and I am sure that most families in North America are the same. We are so thankful for the gifts that he has given us and we will personally feel the loss. We send our thoughts and prayers to his friends and loved ones and hope that they can be comforted by the knowledge that he was loved by millions and that his work will withstand the test of time.  Our deepest condolences. 
Steven Paul Jobs will be missed by Apple employees, Apple Families, and above all else Apple Fans. God bless Steve, the Thomas Edison of our time has died. I hope Apple will continue his vision. He was my hero.
Steve,  Thank you for all that you've done. I remember the glee on my little face when we got our first computer; the Apple IIc. The years I spent sticking by you and your products many years later.  You'll be missed.
My deepest condolences for the apple family. Humanity, indeed, has lost an amazing human being.
to steve jobs   in the field of technology, you were an artist in the truest sense.  you reached for the highest star and accomplished incredible feats of wizardry in the beautiful and functional gizmos that benefited so many people.   you will be remembered and honored by millions throughout the world.
I, as a young medical resident, got my first Macintosh plus in 1987 with almost all my salary. It was a time when my dream, to get my own Apple computer, came true. RIP, Steve, we will miss you. 
Dear Steve,          When I reflect on your behalf, I continuously feel inspiration. I've always appreciated the macintosh product from its design to revolutionary. You had a rare gift which allowed you to know what the people wanted. It was different, and it was special. My condolences to your family, God Bless.&nbsp;
I will miss you Steve and I know that you shared ideas that brightened  my world since I was a child and thank you for all your hard work.
He is my inspiration for being a pioneer who revolutionized technology.  REST IN PEACE STEV JOBS. I send my heartfelt condolences to the Jobs  family. GOD BLESS :):) 
I regret that I came to the apple family late, but my regard for Steve Jobs has never been higher.  My regards and condolences to his family and peers.   It is mind boggling that one man can touch so many thru his own acts.   I am and will remain inspired.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve, you will always inspire us to do better and to find what we love. 
Life is so unpredictable but gives each of us the opportunity to make the most out of each moment. Steve Jobs you did exactly that! Your dreams became our reality. Your vision gave so many hope, jobs, and the ability to dream and believe. Thank you for not being an everyday thinker but one who thought way outside of the box. Rest in peace you have more than left your mark on this world. It is up to those you touched to carry on your work.  
现在微博上到处是来自iphone客户端的哀悼，更多的是来自其它途径，个人的意志真的能改变世界，乔布斯就是个例子，能够让庞大基数的买不起iphone的中国人来哀悼,当然买不起并不是他的错，谢谢他
You will be missed. Thank you for opening our minds and giving us all the world at the palm of our hands. Truly the Michael Jordan of innovation. Forever will have the below signature on all of my products. "sent from my iPhone"  Thanks dude, rest peacefully.
A true genius is gone.  His passion and creativity will be never forgotten.  His work will be continued by his left behind team.  He will stay as a great inspiration.  My prayers to his loved ones and all the apple team. 
You were a visionary. A legend beyond measure. Thank you for leading us into the 21st century. 
Steve Jobs changed the world and made magic real. Godspeed.&nbsp;
My condolences to the family of Mr. Jobs. The world has lost a great leader, a warrior who did not quit until he died. May God rest his soul in peace and his vision continues to inspire, guide &amp; show the generations to come a clear path to leadership.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a true visionary and an inspiration to many of us who are de dicating our lives to use innovation to better human life. His legacy will carry on.
So saddened to hear about Steve. What an incredible innovator and  genius. He will be so missed. Thank you for everything Steve.&nbsp;
He was what America needed. He changed so many industries and become  the role model that children in America and the rest of the world  needed. He has truly changed the world. RIP Steve Jobs. 
Steve has been an inspiration to many and was one of the most talented  people that the world has known. He will be remembered by us all as a  visionary, a person having the will power, the strength and courage to  pursue his vision. His products have touched all people, young and old.  We will miss him.
As a true visionary, I have always looked up to Steve Jobs. Since I was 5 or 6 years old, I've loved computers and have loved figuring out how things work. Thanks to Steve Jobs, he's made me want to do something important with my life. He has set the standard for technology, and I'm very proud to say that I've grown up around his amazing work. He's impacted my life more than most of my family, and I'm reacting worse than passing of family members. There's a slim chance that any one, in this day and age, could surpass the impact on society that Steve Jobs has given us.  Rest in Peace, Steve. 
I am 36 years old, and if I had to pick an Icon that embodied my  lifetime (which is just over 3 decades of Incredible leaps in  technology), I would have to say that person is Steve Jobs.  99% of the technology that I use is Apple Products. I live in a Apple  Eco system because everything "just works" together. Thank you Steve for your contribution to this world, and to how I live  my life today.  Thank you for everything.
Whenever someone so inspiring and truly brilliant crosses over,  the   world is left a lesser place. It is very sad to hear he is no longer with us. Thank you for posting   such a wonderful picture of him. Sending his family and everyone at Apple heartfelt condolences.
Without doubt, the world loses a reference of creativity and an   excellent human being!  Great Job's need large pillows.
Thanks for inventing the ipod touch! its awsome! The world will miss you! 
Its curious how all over the world the death of someone we know little of causes such an impact. I decided to write a few words to who ever will read this, or maybe no one will read this, but i write cause he was universal person, to some, it meant buisness to others it mean family, to some, friend, to some inspiration, to other leaders and genious. my condolences goes out to everyone, and i think it couldnt be better said, the spirit of steve should always be the foundation of apple.
You have inspired so many people and will continue to do so. You will be  so sadly and deeply missed.
He changed my life in 1984. I always had a goal of meeting him. But I guess I meet him everyday as I program on a Mac.  May his soul rest in peace.
So incredible I've always thought of your accomplishments.  So truly  remarkable.  You rock!  We're all the richer for you having spent time  with us.  God bless!&nbsp;
To Steve's family,  I was deeply saddened to hear the news about Steve Jobs today. Words seem inadequate to express the sadness we feel right now . Steve was the genius and the great creator. Mankind got lots of gains through great products from Apple, first selling model on Internet ­iTunes, first digital animation, Toy Story from Pixar, first Tablet, ... Who else in the world can create so many ³first times?!?! We will miss Steve Jobs ... And may the spirit of Steve Jobs be with Apple and us forever.&nbsp;
 You are one of the reasons I'm here. Was happy to be with you. Will never forget you. Thank you.
 Hi, i feel like i've lost a friend, even though i did not know M. Jobs personally, i knew i could count on him to come up with solutions,  great looking solutions,  in my quest for the modern world.
Dear Steve,  Our condolences to you, your family and friends.  You lived an inspired life and we thank you for sharing your life with the world.  We hope to build upon the solid foundation you laid.  Knowing you're in a better place, rest peacefully.
All the best and all my condolences to the Jobs Family... I wish them all the best.... 
My condolences to everyone who knew and loved Mr. Jobs. Without him, I would've never gotten dysentery fording the river, never would've been able to have impromptu 3 hour dance parties with my friends, never would've had the world at my fingertips, never would've truly believed that there was no limit to the imagination, and would not be nearly as close to my family and friends  who are far away. Without Mr. Jobs, my life would be without many memories and connections. It would be a life half lived. Thanks for living your life to the fullest, Mr. Jobs, and touching and changing the world. Forever.
I am in shock and deeply saddened. My condolences to his family and friends. We lost a great man.  Rest in peace Steve.  
Our condolences to the famly and relatives of Steve Jobs.
today not only a family lost a great man, a company and the world also  lost it, from Mexico we want to let u know how much we sorry about it.  there are not enough word to say for sharing the shame that all we feel.  thanks Mr. Jobs for every little thing that made a huge difference.&nbsp;
Very sorry for Steve jobs family, friends, and co-workers. The world lost a great man today, I can't imagine where we would be without his guidance.
Steve Jobs was one of my personal heroes. I am currently studying computer science in high school, and we often talk about him and his achievements in our classes. Steve really inspired me to follow cs, and his life story is remarkable. The world really needs more people like him, because he really was the da Vinci of our time. It's just so amazing how one man could think of such amazing devices, such as mac os, ios, ipod, itunes, iphone, and ipad. He really will be remembered, and will be in our thoughts and prayers.
He dedicated all his life to change the world with unique ideas.  Rest in peace  Steve. 
It's OK to be sad right now, but we should celebrate that he lived and thank  for everything he did for US.
Condolences for the loss of a Steve Jobs, a warm, bright human being.&nbsp;
You have change my life and many others in ways I can't even begin to describe. Thank you for all your hard work and brilliance.
When I learned that Steve Jobs had passed away I literally shed tears.  He was inspirational. He was a man that changed the world as we know it.  I feel like he wasn't only able to think "inside the box" or "outside  the box", but view "the box" as an entirely different object or element.  So here I am rambling about a man I've never known, typing about him on  a device that he made happen. Steve Jobs, you've lived the American  dream and I admire you for that. My thoughts and concern go out to your  family and friends.  With condolences, a grateful modern American.
Steve Jobs has passed away. One of my favorite quotes from him has been "make a ding in the Universe". He indeed made a ding in mine. In my humble opinion amongst his many many assets, his greatest was his "instinct". Like Wayne Gretzky said once, "to anticipate where the puck was going to be". I would not eulogize him with big words. Just that I have total admiration and love for this man. &nbsp;No I did not get to live in the time of Henry Ford. I did more than make up though by living in the time of Steve Jobs     -       - 
Rest in peace Steve Jobs and thanks for everything!
Am really so sad feels like losing a father have been following him so  religiously. He made dreams happen, its really sad and first time in my life i have  really shed tears for someone i have not seen or met personally in my  life; i wont eat today as a small gesture and also i wont be able to. RIP Steve Jobs. A job well done. 
As a happy consumer of Apple products, I feel that it is only right to say a few words about the man that changed the way people use technology.  Six months ago, I converted to a Mac. Prior to that day, I was a full supporter of PC computers. Now, I wasn't one of those "are you a Mac person or a PC person" type, but now, more than ever, I AM that type of person. A Mac person. And I've never been more grateful for the man who made it all happen. All I ever wanted was a reliable computer that didn't freeze, make loud noises, delete my important documents, overheat, shut down, and break into pieces.  I finally have it.  I have since been more involved in Apple updates, and the life of Steve Jobs. I marveled at his accomplishments, his determination, his continuous good nature and kind heart. A month ago, a friend of mine sent me a forward of Steve Job's "Find What You Love" speech at Stanford University. She hoped to ease my nerves before starting my professional degree. I felt inspired and motivated by his words and his message.  I am deeply saddened by his passing and give my condolences to everyone that has ever known him. I know he had so much more to contribute to this world.  Here is to remembering Steve. 
Thank you for changing the world forever. We will miss you. Rest in peace. 
Steve Jobs was my hero... I learned to never give up and always be  creative. I've always been a true supporter of apple since i was a  little boy. I thank him for the computer i use everyday the iphone that  connects me to the world and the ipod that lets me enjoy music.
                  I got my first MacBook at the age of 16. Amongst my friends I was the very first to own an Apple computer. Right from an iPod to a MacBook to the iPhone and to the iPad, I have looked up to how Mr. Jobs has changed the world with his excellence.  I'm only 18 and do not know much about Mr. jobs, but I do know that his inventions excited me and gave me a whole new look at the gizmo world. Apple changed my life. Mr jobs changed my life. He was the man I looked up to and wanted to be like. I will miss you very much Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
The world has lost a great man...a visionary of the best kind. He was   a DaVinci of our time. I never knew him personally and yet tears come   to my eyes. I have lived by the statement... once you go Mac, you   never go back... and I certainly will always be an Apple lover. May he   rest in peace and may his many friends bring comfort to his family.
We know that in times like these, no word is sufficient, however, I send my condolences on the passing of our beloved Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Thanks, Steve, for having so many dreams, seeing them to fruition, and sharing them with all of us.  You made your world, and ours, a better place.  We will miss you, and your creativity.
The world will never be the same. The world has lost the best genius. Thank you for iMac, iPod, iPad, iPhone, and Mac. We will never forget.&nbsp;
Steve,  You changed the world with your amazing technology, and opened minds to  different ideas. Your business skills are unsurpassed by any other  organisation, and as such I watched your career during my 22 years on  the earth very closely.  Your technology is the framework of my success at University. I admire  your hard work and dedication to an organisation.  Rest in Peace, Steve.&nbsp;
I&nbsp;am so sorry. You are the best. Thank you for God who send you to us. 
Thank you for being such an inspiration in my life. Your magic changed the world forever!  Mil gracias! Dios te bendiga!&nbsp;
I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have lived in the same day and  age as Steve Jobs. Because of him, I know for certain that a lone man with vision,  tenacity, focus, and a sense of purpose can indeed change the world. I am humbled.....and this day, immeasurably sad. My heart breaks for his wife and children, as I cannot imagine the depth  of their grief this day.  RIP and Godspeed, Steve Jobs. Thank you for inspiring me in more ways  than any words could adequately describe. &nbsp;We will miss you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a remarkable human being.  I am thankful that Steve was part of my generation.  He was inspirational as an innovator, entrepreneur, intellectual and leader.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his family.
Not just Apple, not just me, but the world.    I was never one to  worry about what your private life was like, but what I did see, what you  did on the public side was absolutely amazing!!  We will all miss you! 
Steve Jobs will be remembered by much of the world for his innovations and perseverance. To the world, an imaginative man has been lost, but they may be no greater esteem then the use of his innovations around the world today. R.I.P Steve Jobs.
Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. Apple won't be the same without you.&nbsp;
In his passing I would like to say- thank you, for what you have   created and left behind for all of us to use. Not only were you   innovative, you presented us, through the establishment of and   collaboration within your company, the ability to Be innovative. Thank   you. Rest in peace- you have had quite a journey. 
 Steve, thank u for being born and thank u for fighting in life!!!&nbsp;
  Thank you for living a life of inspiration, passion and higher goals. Dream big.&nbsp;
I am so deeply upset by this tragic loss. Steve was such an inspiration  to so many people around the world including myself this brings me to  such deep tears. What a wonderful wonderful man this earth has produced  and it is so tragic he can no longer be with us. May he rest in pure  peace. I may not know you Steve but thank you for everything you have  brought to this world.
Steve helped me to realise myself what I can do and what I should not pay attention to. Do best as one can. His spirit will be the part of my remaining life. It seems that he did not pass away. I can feel him around my working time.
 Simply thank you!!! Go in peace, genius!             
Steve you are my hero. You changed the world. Without you the world will not  be the same. Rest in piece, condolence to your family.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,     It is hard to express to you the difference you have made in my life.  Rarely  do people come along in this world whose philosophies and ideas shape a  generation and indeed a planet at the level you have.  What is important is that  you did that one person at a time, one child at a time, one life at a time.  My  life was one of those.  For as long as I can I remember I have carried your  ideas around with me.  They began with a big bulky box in a heavy bag and  continue with the smallest of devices that I carry around in my pocket.  Devices  that I live with throughout my day.  These ideas have allowed me to unleash  untold creative ideas and products, teach young minds about their world, and  help friends find their way.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your  vision.  It truly has made a difference in my life.  All this from a person you never met.  God Bless you and keep you Steve Jobs - you will be missed.  An apple customer for the past 26 years.
I'm sure all of us will remember him very deeply. He had a great,  fulfilling life and gave technology a new world to create.
 You change the world, we love you, Steve. 
 There will never be another human being like Steve.
Thanks Steve (and all in Apple) for designing these beautiful/functional machines.  Steve will be missed.
I am certain  Mr. Jobs was and will continue to be one of the most brilliant minds of  this century. A true visionary who made of technology his truest  artistic expression. His memory will forever live in the hearts of those  who like me truly believe in holding on to ones ideals. Steve Jobs, my heart is heavy today because of your parting, you  will always be an inspiration to me as a free thinker, a businessman and  a true artist.
I have no words to describe my admiration for this man. He is now an eternal spirit, that will continue to inspire generations to come.&nbsp;
So sad. He made the world a better place. Thank you Steve.  My condolences  to his family.
So sad, but grateful for a life well lived.  He was an inspiration.&nbsp;
R.I.P Steve. You will always be an inspiration! 
Dear Apple,  As a Chinese college student who enjoys Apple's product, admires Apple, and loves Mr. jobs, I was so depressed when I heard he was gone.  What he left to us are surely more than those amazing products developed by Apple. This fantastic human will continue inspiring us a long long way. He is  more than phenomenal. Carry on, Apple.&nbsp;
Thank you so much Steve for all you did to inspire the world.  We will always remember you. 
Condolences,  Much Blessings to Jobs' Family and to the Apple Family. We are grateful  of the piece of history.&nbsp;
My sorrow for that loss, but his legacy will never be lost.
Steve, you have inspired me. i love the company you built up. i own many  apple products and i will be buying more in the future. thank you for  everything.
his spirit is all around. we were blessed to live in his lifetime.
Steve is kind of my hero.  End of Story. 
Has change my life and my families and most people around us. He was truly inspirational. He will be missed. RIP   
 My heart is darken by the loss of our amazing Steve Jobs. As an ex-Apple retail and die-hard Apple fan, my deepest blessing goes out to Steve's close friends and family. Steve you touched the life of so many people you will be missed!
What a genius this man was- he changed the lives of many. RIP to a wonderful man and amazing role model.  
A giant of technology who has left a brilliant legacy. Steve and his team made everything else in personal computing and mobile communications look utterly ordinary. He left too early but will always be remembered with great affection.&nbsp;
Hi Steve,  I always wanted to write you an email but i feared that you wouldn't reply. But now you are in a position where you know what's going on.  I just wanted to say that you have been an inspiration for me. The only way that i can thank you is by listening to what you had said- you had asked us to follow are hearts. I will Steve. I want to change me life. And i will start now.  Thank you for all that you've done for us.  Rest in Peace. 
My heart goes out to everyone who loved this mans legacy!!!!&nbsp;
R.I.P Steve Jobs...You'll be missed...you founded an awesome company, got fired by them, came back to them when they were at their lowest point, brought the mac back to life, made iPod a household name, when the doubters said, "what does a computer company know about making a phone!!" You made iPhone a household name and now billions and billions of people enjoy your product and it helps them out with their everyday lives. Steve Jobs was an innovator and had a great vision for his company, may you find peace... I can only hope to one day get a job with the company that you help found....Truly an innovator and like someone else quoted, "the apple of america's eye!!"
I am deeply saddened by this news. He will be sorely missed! Thank you  for everything! You have given the world so much!  Death is very likely the best invention of life. All pride, all fear of  embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of  death, leaving only what is truly important.&nbsp;
Nobody could have done what Steve Jobs did. Everything I use is apple. Everything I love electronic is apple. Apple has come so far. R.I.P. Steve Jobs. 
Steve Jobs didn't know me, but he didn't need to. He still changed my life. As a graduating college student with a degree in Creative Writing, as a songwriter, and as a self-producing musician, Steve Jobs, through his innovations with Apple, has altered what I do on every level--as a poet, as a guitarist, and as someone who just wants to use computers without thinking about them as computers. Steve Jobs was the man who made me believe that computers are not inherently evil. He has inspired me to be an innovator, to follow my own passionates, risking it all on what I know is the right thing. Apple has a gap which can't be filled; but that only underscores the importance of this man: he has left something behind bigger than just one man's mortality. Apple can't help but continue being innovators in its field. Jobs is still alive in Apple, in everything it does at every level.&nbsp;
Life is too short not to THINK DIFFERENT everyday.... thanks Steve.  The world will miss you greatly.&nbsp;
Just bought my first iPhone a few weeks ago--I never imagined how cool a cell phone could be.  So sorry for his family and friends.
 SJ - Thanks for the innovations You made a Difference!
Thanks for sharing and making your vision a reality....you will be   missed.  Peace to Steve and the Apple family.
Thank you Steve for all that you have given us over the years.  Thank you for your Vision, your Creativity, your Dedication to seeking Perfection in all you did and all you created.  Thank you for giving us tools and toys we didn't even know we would need or want.  Thank you for all the "insanely great" machines from the Apple II to the first MAC, the IPODS, the IPHONES and the IPADS.  Thank you for building the greatest computer and consumer products company on the planet.  Thank you for building a team who will continue to follow your vision and build on your legacy.  You truly changed the world.  And the world is a lesser place without you in it.  True visionaries come to us maybe once every hundred years or so.  You will be greatly missed by all.  Peace be with you and your family and all of your extended Apple family
I have to believe that Steve Jobs made tech cool and appealing. Without him and his partners, I feel that we "as users" would not be the same. RIP Steve Jobs.
Not only has Apple lost a creative genius, but we will all miss the   man, his vision and the way he had the ability to change our lives.  This is a sorrowful day. 
I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family of the most brilliant gentleman in the Whole world, and also everyone in the Apple. He will be always remembered, I am very shocked By this news. God bless his family  May he rest in peace.
Thank you Mr Jobs, you showed humanity that one man can influence the world for the better.  Love you, and thanks for all the energy you gave to us.  Rest in Peace my Brother. 
The next generations will think of Steve the way that we think of Einstein,  Edison, etc.  He is one of our world's greats.
Dear Sirs:  Steve Jobs changed the way my family and friends live. I hope that his enthusiasm and innovation will inspire current and future generations to always excel.  I will miss his keynotes a lot.
I grieve for the future of computing. I grieve not only for the loss of Steve Jobs' talent and vision but the inspiration that he provided. Everybody in the technology world pushed themselves just a little harder because Steve Jobs set the bar so high.  As John F. Kennedy was to the space race, Steve Jobs was to the connectivity between man and machine. 
You were a great great man. You will be missed!  
The heart of Apple (us users) will forever be heavy as the true  patriarch is gone. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs.   --You will always be the  "Apple" of our eyes as we watch what evolves now from the great company  you created!!!&nbsp;
He was the missing piece of the puzzle and because of him there's no longer a  puzzle. It's solved! But it's still missing something. The awesome in apple.
Hi.  Just wanted to share my heartfelt condolences with  the family and  friends of Steve.  Not only was Steve a visionary and a  genius, but also a  powerful entity.  Though I never had the pleasure  of meeting him, he seemed  like a special person; a down-to-earth and kind  man, with an incredible  intellect.  Some of the thoughts and wisdom  that shined during his commencement  speeches, were very powerful and  truly inspirational.  The world lost a  good soul, before his  time.  My thoughts go out to everyone that is touched by  his  unfortunate passing.&nbsp;
 My heartfelt feelings to the family. May God grant you serenity and strength to go through this time.﻿ With respect and admiration.
I have never met Steve Jobs. But I have lost a hero. Even though this is a sad time, it is also a time to look forward, and to celebrate the man that started it all.  I give my condolences to Steve's family.  I just want to say thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
    We'll miss you Steve Jobs. Your were a great inventor. I begged my parents for a  two whole years to get your second and third generation Ipod touches. You do not  know how much the world will miss you. You will be missed. I hope to truly meet  you in heaven someday
I don't know too many personal stories about Steve besides what the  majority of the public already knows, but I feel that his death is the  death of so many aspirations and excitement that the general public  holds when Steve does what he does best.... reinventing the way we  think, act, and communicate. May he rest in peace and with his Lord.
My prayers go out to Steve's family, friends and  co-workers.  Today the  world has lost one of the most amazing human  beings, but Heaven has gained a  wonderful angel.     Steve first touched my life in 1983 when the first computer I ever  learned  to use was the original Mac.  No hard drive, one floppy disk drive,  small  black and white screen and this crazy thing called a mouse.  One  "click"  and I was hooked.  Many Macs, iPods, iPhones and iPad later,  I'm still  impressed and always a fan.   My deepest condolences.&nbsp;
What a shock and what a loss to the world. He was a visionary.  Prayers and comfort to friends and family. 
Wow. Steve was such an inspiration to us all- a visionary, a leader, and a man, who without his contributions, the world would be a different place. His ideas, and inventions really changed the way we use our lives today, and we take technology for granted sometimes. He really made a contribution to the world, and was extraordinary and set his standards high. May his family, and the Apple family be consoled.
You made this world a better place. May you rest in peace.
A true Inspirational Leader of our times, iconic CEO, Steve made Tech fashionable, he made the vision of the future in the Mac SE how it enriched our lives, creating a pathway for innovation and design. He was a living genius who changed the face of the tech world for the better.&nbsp;
My condolences to Steve's wife and family, friends and collegues.Today, we all lost a family member. Through his vision and the technologies that resulted from it, and as users of those technologies, Steve connected all of us together as one big family. He made us feel like we were part of something bigger than all of us.  Rest in Peace my friend,  Long Live Apple. &nbsp;
Rest in peace and our thoughts are with your family and friends.  Thank you for everything you have done, you were a true visionary one that time will not forget.
My sincere condolences to the family of Steve Jobs and Apple, today we lost a genius, a visionary person, capable of creating a company like Apple from nothing and yet and capable to kept his ideals and be able to transmit it to the world, a simple person. Rests in peace.&nbsp;
Thank you for everything you have done to make my life more enjoyable.   I am truly sorry for your loss.&nbsp;
I design and edit on Mac , I hear my music on Mac , getting inspiered on Mac ... Talking with friends on Mac .. Writing my ideas on Mac... playing games on Mac .. 90% of my life on Mac ... I feel like I have known ........ Steve Jobs rest in peace and thank you for every thing
Every day I'm reminded of how amazing Steve Job is, and was.  From my iPhone, my MacBook Pro, my iMac, my iPod Touch and yes, my iPad 2. Thank you Steve for everything you've made Apple, and for enabling millions to work, live, play and learn.&nbsp;
I am thankful for Steve's time with us as an inventor, a creator and as a driver of passion, commitment and inspiration.&nbsp;
Dear Steve  I am a young mac user ( 2010~) from Hong Kong. I feel so wonderful when I use mac machine first time. Many many thanks you make a wonderful &amp; amazing mac life world to us.  Thank you very much &amp; miss you forever~!!
Steve jobs   I was really touched by your speech of the Stanford. I appreciate your words Thanks again. I will follow your teachings.&nbsp;
Actually I was very saddened by the death of Steve Jobs.  He will always be a source of inspiration for innovation and creativity within a sophisticated concept of simplicity. It is an honor to have an interesting product for producing a genius.   May God protect this great man. His legacy will always be remembered in this infinite virtual world and real.
Thanks for all the work you did Steve.   You were one of the greatest  minds the world has ever seen.&nbsp;
The best. The Genius. Nothing will be as before.
The day my partner replaced her desktop PC with an iMac in the mid-2000s it changed her life. Several iPhones and desktops and laptops later in our home and her family's homes and soon a likely iPad for my parents who have yet to join the online world, we are so very grateful. Steve Jobs brought us amazing  worlds and fun and ease with his visionary genius. Rest in peace Steve - you will be sorely missed and forever admired and appreciated.
I never met Steve Jobs. However, his genius makes my life more enjoyable and my job more efficient as I use the products he and the others at Apple have devised. I am not a "switcher." I can honestly say as a 40 year old male that I have owned only Apple products and they have never let me down.  When I got the news that he had resigned, I knew that his death was probably near. But when I got the "breaking news" email that he had passed away, my heart sank. I know he is irreplaceable in many ways, but I hope Apple continues down the path that Steve blazed in creating such high quality, beautiful and dependable products that "just work."  We are most like God when we are creative. Well, Steve was a creative genius. I pray he was at peace with his Maker. They will have a lot to discuss!
I am 57 and am so in love with my IPAD2 people laugh at me a bit.  I am looking forward to pre-ordering my new IPhone on Friday.  Thank you Steve. Thank you to all the wonderful employees of Apple. Thank you to Steve's family for sharing him so he could share greatness with the world.  I am sorry for the loss you are all feeling now.&nbsp;
I wrote my first lines of code on an Apple IIe when I was barely in elementary school. That experience shaped my life immeasurably. Learning how to code at such a young age taught me how to think and solve complex problems. It led to my first job, working as a software developer when I was seventeen. Steve's example  made me want to start my own company, which I have, and his exquisite taste has an impact of virtually every decision I make. He will be missed. 
Words cannot describe what this man has done for the world.   Thoughts go out to everyone who was close to him and his family.  The world won't be the same without Steve.
 Steve did manage to make a dent in the universe!  Our sincere condolences.   R.I.P. Seve Jobs.
To Steve:  Restart and reboot yourself Steve, you are free to go. Password: Apple enter here, right now. Force quit: directly to iCloud. Move to trash: never. Rise up as a Leopard, Tiger or Lion. You will never die. You are free to go.  Mixing some lyrics of the Unknown caller U2 song. Typing from my great Macbook Pro.&nbsp;
The world has lost a great man, a void that may never be filled by another.  Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;
It is no exaggeration to say that few creators have influenced my life more than Steve Jobs.  Thank you, sir.
Dear God,  If there is heaven, or paradise, please get this great man there, and allow him the noblest suite. Give him a simple job and does not require much, but leave it free to create, no doubt he will contribute greatly to cool ideas to improve the world and help you revolutionize and implement. Know that here on earth he changed history.  Steve go with God, your family stay comfortable and at peace.&nbsp;
Rarely does one man's passing rob humankind's future of so much promise but seldom has one man created such a beautiful future for our species.  Love ya forever Steve
I'm so sorry and I'll be always thanks when I use my iPhone. STEVE JOBS ... Rest In Peace...&nbsp;
Hi,  I would like to express my condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Steve Jobs.  I know that, in America, Steve Jobs played a big role in many ways. I didn't have the same opportunity to at least hear all the great work he's been doing right from the start until Youtube was born. At a younger age, I remember catching only few second glimpses of him and Apple's progress as he presented himself and his company to media. Needless to say, when I had the opportunity with the help of the Internet, I became a huge fan of Steve Jobs as I discover how he really changed the world. How I wish he is still with us for a much longer time. I share in your sorrow on this sad moment.
Are there any words that can truly convey the genious of Steve Jobs? The man who created some of the greatest technological innovations of our times. Who taught us it is ok to fail, to be different, and that we can learn from our failures and mistakes. Who lived with such passion, productivity, and creativity even in the face of a long battle with cancer.&nbsp; He represents all that is beautiful and awesome in humanity. What a gift to human civilization. He will be deeply missed. &nbsp;
I would just to offer my deepest condolences from the bottom of my heart. Steve was an inspiration to every tech head out there, whether they would like to admit or not. I just want to say thank you, Steve, for inspiring me and billions of other people to strive only for the best. You changed the world. May you rest in peace.
Steve Jobs, a genius who has changed so many lives in so many ways for the better. He'll be sadly missed. Our thoughts and well wishes go to Steve's family, friends and colleagues. Rest in peace.
 Una gran persona. Un genio. Un emprendedor. Por siempre...            
Thank you for everything, Steve Jobs. Your enthusiasm and dedication to technology and the future was incredible and will be missed. Rest in peace and God bless.
Thank you, Steve....for everything.&nbsp;
 As someone who once was a technological Luddite, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to Mr. Jobs for loosening and evolving the boundaries of my mind, and for making the prospect of the future fun.
My name is Michael. Steve Jobs is a mentor to me. Everybody at work and  all my friends, I would tell them to buy Macs, Ipads, and Iphones. I  would always bring up Mr. jobs. Without Steve Jobs the world would not  be the same. He has changed what cell phones look like and what they can  do. The IPad and the Iphone are two greatest inventions. Steve Jobs name  will never be forgotten. I feel bad that he had a form of pancreatic  cancer. I am so sorry that everyone loss him to early. I feel so bad for  his family and close friends. My heart is broken, Mr Steve Jobs will  forever be in my heart.  I am so sad for this loss.
 The world will remember you  Steve.             
It was great shock and deeply sad news. my condolences to Steve's family, friend and all the people who loved Steve.  Never had chance to meet him personally but his life really was influencing to my growth. It was great joy to watch how Steve drastically change his destinies and I truly loved his creative products as customer. One of most inspiring, motivating person to my life and I always dreamed about the courage and passion he had. Learned a lot from you, Steve. Thank you very much and you will be missed.
Our thoughts are with the Jobs family. We will miss Steve and remember the legacy he left behind.&nbsp;
Steve was a great creator of irresistible technologies - new kind of  pleasure - for people, who have creative thinking and who generate  ideas. He was the hard-worker that always inspired me with his thorough  approach to   every detail in his project by polishing the results of  his research until they could shift everyone's expectation.  Im just a user of Apple, but I feel proud to be a part of Apple's  family.  And I would like to thank Steve for the dream that he sold to me in a  form of technology.  I present my condolences to Steve's family and Apple Team.
All of those studies that state we are at the nascent stage of becoming cyborg-like by offloading part of our memories increasingly to electronic devices is true.  I am glad I lived in a time of visionaries like Steve Jobs who made those "electronic devices" we were incorporating into our very beings just a bit more human than what had come before.
This man (Steve Jobs) has transformed many households and lives, its  great i lived during his time on earth. RIP Steve. 
Steve was a great man who made Apple what it is today.  I hope his legacy is continued. 
When I got a Mac I was 12, and even with all the problems that I needed surpass (I didn't even know how to turn on that machine), with school works didn't working because of the file format, considerated different, a strange. Even with that I saw on my Mac the opportunity of realize all my dreams, in my country I want to be something that it's almost impossible to happen, study cinema, arts, game design and computer science. I saw on Mac a cover, where I could do everything, a way to I reach my goals. So what I must do is thank you, Steve Jobs, because you were a dreamer that made me believe in my own dreams.   I will miss you, I will miss your innovative way, your dreams.     From a 14 years old boy that saw on Mac his future. 
World will miss this amazing human being!!!! He was very motivational and spirited. God bless his Sole.
Even though I never knew Steve personally, this news struck me hard. In losing him we have lost a visionary, a genius, and in his own sense a world leader. He will not be forgotten. 
 From our family to the Jobs and Apple families, our sincerest  condolences.  Mr. Jobs was a true visionary. I will never forget the  1984 Apple commercial nor his constant push for newer and better  technology.  His legacy will forever live.  This world is a better place  because of him.&nbsp;
I have been one of Apple's best unpaid salesman for almost 15 years! Thank you Steve for making the world a better place with your vision and courage. Go Apple!
I had just left an Apple Store when I heard the news. It is hard to believe that he is gone. My life has been changed because of what he gave. I am forever grateful. Thanks Steve.
I am sorry for the loss 
My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of Steve Jobs   in this the most difficult of times. Steve will always be remembered   as a visionary, pioneer, a man truly ahead of his time. You will be   missed but never forgotten.
Steve was my idol, his knowledge in computers has inspired me to try and  be like him, even though this is probably an impossible goal. Steve was  truly an amazing person, and will forever be in my heart as the most  influential person of the modern era. Steve, you will be missed.
  RIP Steve Jobs, an extraordinary person. We'll miss him.
Steve Jobs inspired us all so much, I know for certain he inspired and changed my life. When I didn't know what to do with my life Apple products showed me a path for my imagination. I thank Steve Jobs for his vision and he will always be remembered. My prayers are with his family and friends. Thank you Steve Jobs for showing us we can live out our dreams.&nbsp;
  ...and thank you for adding fun to technology and for improving the lives of all who use your incredibly visionary products.
My condolences to the passing of a great person who changed the face of consumer electronics. &nbsp;
Thank you for an amazing ride. The world we live in would have been very boring were it not for you changing it radically the last 14 years.   I consider myself extremely lucky to have lived in your insanely great time.  Rest in peace.
   Steve You will be missed forever! Your character, way of life and tremendous products that you created with passion and love will always be buried deep in our DNA. You will always be a legend! Rest in peace.
"With Great Power, Comes Great responsibility" Well done Steve for excellence and visionary within your Field. You will be missed.
YOU Changed this world and brought so much to everyone lives directly and indirectly, I hope you can now rest in peace after fighting Cancer. you will be missed. thank your for everything, there was only one thing that i wished i had the chance to meet you, R.I.P Steve thanks for everything.
Apple and the world have lost a very powerful and amazing pioneer and visionary. I know Apple will succeed and follow Steve's vision for the company and the world. He will be missed best of luck and condolences to everyone at Apple and to Mr Job's family! 
He can now truly see the impact he made on the world. And we all can embrace him in our hearts - after all - he connected us all.  One. Amazing. Man.   With so much love.     
Thanks for your vision and dedication.  You are an inspiration and a difficult act to duplicate, but a journey worth following!  Rest in Peace Steve! 
Such an innovator.  Forever when I think about any type of technology I  will think of Steve Jobs.  I did not know him personally but I know his  kind of genius only comes once in a lifetime.  My heartfelt condolences  go out to Mr. Jobs' family.  Rest in love.
At 36-years-old I can say I truly grew up with Apple; the very first computer I had the chance to use was an Apple IIe. When I was in 4th grade my mom transitioned from a kindergarten teacher to the computer coordinator in my Catholic school district, which allowed our family to be integrated into the continuous innovations of Apple. The exciting revolutions that Jobs orchestra led is a major influence on why I became a professor of technology. It only seems fitting that I learned about Mr. Jobs' passing from the AP wire app on my iPhone.   It is truly a sad day.  My condolences to Steve Jobs' family and friends. His impact on society will  carry on forever.
These are the numbers of years I've been using Apple's products. It all  started with a Macintosh Performa in 1996, first computer the family  bought. I was 6. I was in my home city, Lyon, France. Now I've got my own MacBook, and I'm an iPhone developer for a company  in London.  Somehow, Steve Jobs has built things that my whole life have been  surrounded with and I owe him my passion and my work. I never meet him, nor talk to him. I wish I had. I'm sad.  I thank everybody at Apple for having made the world a better place  thanks to incredible products, always right and trustworthy. I send you  all my best thoughts to continue without Steve. To produce great  software and products that... that just fit.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was and still is my role model. His work has inspired me to try and become a designer at Apple. I will greatly miss him, as I am sure every Apple fan will as well. I am keeping his family in my prayers and hope that only the world can see this as another opportunity to reflect on his genius, instead of his passing.
Though we didn't know Steve personally, his genius and vision encouraged us to dream and make those dreams a reality. We will be praying for all of you: it's been a tough series of years, and we know the pain of chronic illness takes it toll on all. Steve inspired us, and we send our sincere condolences to those close to him.
I had one person I wanted to meet in my life, and that one person was Steve Jobs. I'm only 17 and I know that it would be a slim shot to meet him, but I always just thought that I would meet him, my idol, my role model. Only if I was able to just talk to him for 5 minutes, that would mean the world, but at least he's making iPhones for God in heaven now. Thomas Edison of our time is Steve Jobs. 
Among many other things, your 2005 Stanford commencement speech is one  of the most inspiring events I can think off.  May your spirit soar. 
The world mourns with you. He touched lives from coast to coast and from continent. Your family is in our prayers. May God bless and keep you.
I did not know Steve. I use many apple product every day at home and at work  and I am just thankful for all he has done to create a wonderful company and amazing life changing products. May his memory always be as a blessing.
Thank you for your help 
You and the companies you created (Apple and Pixar) have made my life easier, interesting, and more fun.&nbsp; Even without seeing or knowing me, you've touched me greatly.&nbsp; Rest in peace....
Sirs,      Apple today lost a great leader of men. My condolences.      Thanks,      Rodrigo&nbsp;
My prayers go out to his family. We have lost someone that has changed world through technology! His brilliance was shown and we must continue to equip and inspire our young people to create!
Sad for his family and all of us. 
Prezados,  Meu grande sonho era de simplesmente um dia apertar a mão de Steve, tenho acompanhado sua carreira desde que entendo por informática e justo no ano do meu nascimento se fez o Apple Lisa, fiquei muito triste com esse fato. O meu sentimento de ter perdido algo que sempre me motivou por sua inteligencia e perspicácia esta muito forte, pois o Steve foi e sempre será para mim o patrono da informática o grande idealisador. Infelizmente não consegui realizar o meu sonho mais o poder de Deus se manifesta nele pois sempre nos trouxe a alegria de usar o produtos criados pela Apple, que Deus possa abençoar sua família e confortá-los. De tão grande vontade era de conhecer esse criador que hoje trabalho com a Gestao da Tecnologia por sua causa.  Fica aqui um grande abraço e os meus sentimentos ao grande patrono da evolução da Infomática.&nbsp;
Truly original thinkers are very, very rare, and Steve fundamentally changed the industry not once, but several times, over 4 decades with truly original thought. We may have seen many things differently, but there was no doubting your genius.
   Hi,   I live in Seoul, Korea and I don't know Steve in person of course. But I am using iPhone and iPad 2 and always surprised of how those products are innovative and kind. Thanks to him, I feel that I am in 21st century indeed.   Steve, the world in 10 years with you           the world in 10 years without you           it must be different...I will miss you.            I am sorry for the loss of great man.
A role model who inspired us a lot ... will miss you ...iSalute 
 A legend by modern day standards. Creating things that change our life and lighten our load. Thanks for all these. We will miss you. Your legacy shall continue.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs, although I never met him, was the greatest inspiration in my  life.  He taught me that any vision could be built, and that any problem  could be solved.  He also inspired me during my toughest times in life  that all struggles could be overcome.  We have lost one of the greatest  minds of our modern history.   Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs.
To say Steve will be remembered is an understatement.  His contribution to the computing world is immeasurable.  I am at a loss for words.  God's speed, Steve.  You, sir, will be missed.
I am truly sad to hear that our hero, the person who.changed our lives for the better, is not with us any more.  If there were more people like Steve, this would be a much better world.  The best of wishes to his family and friends. Apple user since the Apple 2c  Sent from my iPad 
Thank you Steve for changing the world...I always waited for the one more thing.
Steve,   Thank you. 
He will be alive until the last music of the latest iPod stop playing.&nbsp;
Every day Steve's products allow us to conduct our lives efficiently and elegantly. His visionary products have the power to inspire, trust and depend- something only found In true friendship. Thank you Steve for all that you have done and will continue to do for generations to come.
I looked up to Steve Jobs throughout my life. I was always amazed by  his next thing and whenever he did a presentation. I cannot believe that  he is gone. I send my condolences to his entire family. He will be  missed very much.&nbsp;
There were some things you could always look forward to on a daily basis and that ALWAYS included whatever Steve Jobs was up to. A truly unique, sincere and dedicated person that I greatly respected and admired. Not only did he Think Differently. He Thought Right.&nbsp;
I have nothing to say but THANK YOU!
It's a great shock and it took some time for me to recompose myself. It is a very sad day in the history of innovation and I'm greatly depressed by hearing this as I'm a great fan of Steve and idolize him to the core.  We will always remember you Steve!
 So sorry to hear what happened to Steve Jobs he is going to be missed by so many out there. Steve's family and the people of Apple has my deepest and sincere condolences. Steve's legacy not just at Apple but in the Computer World, The Consumer Electronics World, and with the various individuals who proudly own the various products made by Apple.   Rest In Peace and may Steve Jobs and his legacy be remembered for years to come.             
Absolutely heartbroken of the news!  It was clear he was a passionate man but above all a genius.  Will be missed greatly!
He has changed the way people think. When my son was not even two he could unlock the touch and find his folder and play his games and books. Apple was the first fruit he could say. Thank you Steve and everyone for helping to change the world.
I was typing a long text, expecting to find the right words to describe  the man and this unfortunate moment, but I thrown it all out.  My condolences to all friends, family.  To all Apple, this goes without saying it, but I'm sure you guys had the  privilege to be near one of the greatest.  Farewell, Steve. 
You were a brilliant mind that revolutionized the way we communicate.  I forever am an Apple fan due to your innovative designs and your ability to realize what the consumer wants.  I feel like I lost a friend despite,&nbsp;unfortunately, never actually knowing you.  Condolences to your family and all linked to Apple.  You left this world a better place, something we can only hope to do too.&nbsp;
Our deepest condolences to the bereaved family of STEVE JOBS, may our  LORD GOD ALMIGHTY grant his soul eternal rest. 
Rest In peace Steve Jobs. I'm keeping my iPad off for an hour today to remind myself how life was before your wonderful invention.
We have lost a genius, a revolutionary man. Steve was the greatest visionary the world had. Now, the world has lost him. With him, we were one step closer. Now, with his death, we have taken that step back. Steve Jobs was not only a person, but the representation of a whole idea: originality and perfection. Something most of us are far from achieving.Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. Your ideal will not be forgotten.Alberto, in tribute to Steve Paul Jobs (1955-2011).&nbsp;
Steve,  You will be missed. I love all of the products you are responsible for, and your stock has performed very well :)  I worked at one of Apple's retail stores for a year and it was a great experience that I will carry with me always. Thank you for everything.
While I was never an Apple user; I remember using Apple computers in school before the Windows era of computing came to be. My first computer experienced happened on an iMac from 1999/2000. I remember thinking to myself when using it in school just how fast and beautifully designed it was in comparison to the other computers that were running Windows variants.  Steve was a great part of Apple and he helped define the way people viewed their computers and phones. He was one of the first to fully support touch technology as well and make it work like a charm. I still remember the moment I first saw an iPhone commercial and I thought to myself; "Wow, that's a really amazing phone. Finally, something that I could use".  My thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by this horrible loss. While we may have lost a legend who helped show technology in a edgy light; we will never lose the spirit that shapes Apple as being one of the many amazing and truly special companies out there. It's a shame to see him go so soon, but may he look down upon everyone with smiles knowing in the skies just what an amazing legacy he left behind. This isn't the end but only the start of something even more beautiful than imagined.  R.I.P Steve Jobs. You will be missed but never forgotten.
iSad.  To Steve and the apple family,  Thank you for being part of my family and now that your gone you will never be forgotten.  You left a wonderful team of people who will continue your vision for this great company you created.  My family will always continue to remember you through the wonderful products that Apple will continue to make.  Thank you again for the wonderful past and future memories your products will make.  As my family continues to grow we will use every single apple products to show case memories that are going to be created on your machines.  Thank you again Steve.
Shock.  Steve transformed our world. A whole generation was shaped by his vision.     THANKYOU.
Steve Jobs was a great man and was a very inspiration person to many people. He will truly be missed by all.
Dear Steve,  thanks for what you have done for those amazing apple products. here is no you any more in the world. 
I was really happy with you. I can't forget my iPod, MacBook, and iPhone since 2001 I'm still huge fan for Apple. Take care steve.
Steve jobs,        Steve is our model! He tried to change the world , and made it a better place. His hornor could not be replaced by anybody in the planet! Remembeing steve! Apple go ahead!
He embodied the definition of human being.... He gave So much. He will be sorely missed.&nbsp;
Briefly, I have a deep sense of loss with the passing of Steve. While I never met him personally, his vision, his complete genius has revolutionized the way I experience the world around me. From the way I listen to music, to the way I experience movies, to the way I use my fingers and hands, my senses are completely illuminated through Apple products and services. The world has lost a modern day Ben Franklin....that being said, I am confident that his spirit, the fire, the breath of genius will live on deeply in every person that calls Apple Inc home to bravely lead the revolution onward.&nbsp;
I was very sad to hear about Steve Job's death. We lost an amazing human  being and a genius. No one will be able to take Steve's place. R.I.P.
I'm a better artist because of Steve Jobs, period. You will be missed Kind Sir.
It's almost hard to believe considering yesterdays Apple presentation and all the positive vibe. I'm speechless, Apple products and design has been part of my life since I was 12, I'm 33 now. It inspired my career as a designer in so many ways. Steve Jobs and Apple not only created amazing products, but brought technology and user closer together like no other company. His vision will be missed, and I hope someone at Apple learned enough from this genius to keep bringing his vision for decades to come. 
I hope you guys can carry on Steve's legacy. Big big shoes to fill. Good luck!&nbsp;
Hello, I just wanted to say Steve was a great influence not only for Apple, for the world, he was a great human being, a genius, and of course a very great man. I never had the priviledge to meet Steve, he was one of the admirable people in the world for me. In moments like this we have to thank God we had a great human being like Steve in our lives.GOD BLESS STEVE JOBS.
What a terrible loss.  Truly. I can think of a million ways in which products that Steve had a hand in  creating have drastically affected my life for the better and put me in  touch with people I simply wouldn't know right now if not for him.  My thoughts go out to his family and friends.
Hi from Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic,  Thanks for being and inspiring person. Mostly because Jobs impact my  vision of perfection. Thanks for being passionate and enterprenour to  make your and our World better.&nbsp;
I can remember the day I got my blue iPod Mini seven years ago in the  sixth grade.  It was the coolest thing that I owned at the time, and I  have been a die-hard fan of all Apple products ever since.  The moment I  found out that Mr. Jobs passed away today, I felt much discomfort and  sadness of my well being because this man is the reason why I have such  an obsession with technology and how much we can learn from it.  I will  always remember Mr. Jobs as the man who came up with a product that  inspired me to explore and stay connected to the ever changing world of  technology.  I send my best to his family and friends, for I feel like I  lost an idol and hero.
 we may not know you in person, but, because of what you do, we know that you want to make life easier for us. thank you and God bless you. condolences to the family of Mr. Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Rest in peace, Steve.  I can't thank you enough. I use your product every single day for my design work.  You have changed our world for the better.  Arigato, Steve. We will miss you. 
Thanks Steve for making Apple and for being an inspiration for all - in business and in life.       I am sorry that I waited too long to really appreciate your genius, of which I am truly humbled.&nbsp;
Today we have lost a great technology visionary, may he rest in peace. 
 I might be a 15 year-old child, but I have so much respect for Steve Jobs, it's not even funny. All of my life I have wanted a MacBook Pro, and an iPod Touch. I have yet to get ether. I love Apple products from the bottom of my heart, and I get to use everyone else's. It kills me. I have to install custom theme packages to make my computer "act" like a Mac, that's how bad I want to use the wonderful technology that Jobs has created. I watched his keynotes for every new product. I told everyone at school about the "new stuff." I have a passion for Apple and always will. Steve Jobs, you will never, and I mean never, be forgotten. The man that changed history forever, Steve Jobs. R.I.P -2011. I also would like to encourage the fight against cancer, whether it be pancreatic or not, the fight for cancer will always be present. My last and final goodbyes, R.I.P Steve Jobs. Missed by a thousand hearts.            
May you rest in peace the greatest man that i've ever known.. thank you for your shared innovations... I will miss you Steve.
What an icon! Apple will continue to move forward because leaders continue to build  as they mentor others and pass on gracefully the necessary skills to build an empire just as Steve Job did so well.  May God richly bless the Job family and give them peace in days to come.&nbsp;
Bye Steve Jobs, you changed the world.&nbsp;
Thank you for making our lives better, with your vision.  And changing the dry and cold landscape that used to be tech... Forever&nbsp;
 I'm grateful to God for be a contemporary of Steve, a great man on many good ways that inspires me with his history, personality and heart. When I have my children I'll can tell them about this man who was responsible for almost all of this tecnology that they have. With all my heart, Goodbye, Steve.             
A true inspiration for a generation of young followers like myself. Mr. Jobs has provided the world with incredible innovations and a remarkable career in creating the world's greatest technology giant. His incredible foresight and vision will truly be missed.
Grateful to Steve for inspiring so many, especially by sharing his vision, and encouraging innovation in all of us.  I raised my son on apple products, and today he is photographer with a vision, inspired to tell a story through photographs.  We have a start up, that uses all Apple products, and we producing games that teach Physics.  We have a vision to re-imagine Science.  Thank you Steve.  To the Jobs family, our prayers are with you, God's peace to you. &nbsp;
I remember not knowing very much about Apple products, until I saw my  first Mac computer late in 2007.  It was on display in a store, and I  knew immediately that I had to have one.  I was absolutely enthralled  with it  I have since owned two, and I have loved each one of them.  I  have also owned 2 different iPhones, and a number if iPods. Steve Jobs was a genius, to say the very, very least.  The world has  lost a brilliant inventor,  marketer, and a wonderful person.  He will  be forever missed.  Rest in Peace Steve.
I've been an Apple user for many, many years...I'm even a couple years  Steve's senior...I am so saddened to hear of his passing, my condolences  to his family, and I do believe that we'll all have to take a step back before his loss is realized...it's a massive loss for technology,  and a much more humanistic loss for mankind. RIP Steve Jobs... 
Dear Steve, Our heart goes out for you. You inspiring millions and millions by your vision on life and your love for family. Since you are Buddhist, we share our good deed to you.&nbsp;
Hello I'm 11 year's old,  And my family has  2 Apple's computer's, 2 Ipod touch's, 1 Ipod shuffle  and am Ipod classique and soon to be an IPad 2...Which is my dream to  have!  My Whole family and I  love Mac and tell all our friends how good  this software and all of the other things you make are! We say when you go mac you cant go back!  And last I would just like to say how sad we are to know that a genius  like Steve Jobs has died and that his family has our  condolences with  them.  Thank you so much for all of your time!
Dear Apple Team, My family and I were saddened to hear about the passing of Mr. Jobs.  I am a  68 year old person who loves computers and techie stuff, but was not very good at using them.    So it was such a gift to be able to own an iPod, an iPad, and an iPhone, and BE ABLE TO USE ALL OF THE FEATURES ON EACH OF THEM!  My passion is listening to music.  So the iPod was like a miracle to me.   To be able to download my cd collection to my computer, and then put playlists on my iPod, and be able to listen to any kind of music, anywhere...I can't even begin to thank all of you who made this possible. My second passion is reading.  So now with my iPad, I can download any book  and literally have a library with me wherever I am.  Another technological miracle.&nbsp;The iPhone is the first phone I have ever owned that is user friendly, and trust me, I had tried many.I just wanted you to know who much my life was improved because of Mr. Jobs and his amazing ideas.  Please add my condolences to the millions you must be  receiving, for his family and of couse the Apple Team.
Dear Steve,  Tonight I must tell you that every product you made I worshipped it and after every presentation I would make at work  I would put my Apple logo in the end on keynotes to tell the Non Mac world that I am proud of my mac. I will miss you immensely. It is painful to think we will not see you again but  you will always be with us in every product you ever made.&nbsp;
Steve, you were a very kind hearted, inspirational addition to the world. You made dreams more possible for designers like myself. Thank you.  God will be greeting you up there (possibly asking you to show Him how to use facetime on His iphone?)  God bless you and your family.
I can't believe that he is is not with us anymore. The world is a little better because of his vision.  Rest in peace.    
 So sorry for your loss and happy for you to have had him in your lives.&nbsp;
 We want to thank this man we did not know.    A man who has influenced  our  lives in so many ways.  We believe he is in a better place and our   condolences and well wishes go to the family and friends he has left  behind.  Pay close attention because his spirit will be close to you in  the next days until you lay him to rest.  May God be with his family and  friends at this difficult time and in the journey ahead.  Our deepest  sympathy&nbsp;
From the original Apple II to Next to iPhone, Steve thank you for  these great products and your vision. We will miss you!
I'm a Mexican living in USA now as a citizen. I'll remember Steve Jobs  as a genius and a person that make the world an amazing place to live. I  love apple computers and I hope the people in the company will keep  making the best computers just like Steve did.  I'm so sorry he is gone.&nbsp;
So incredibly sorry to hear about Steve's passing.  The world has lost an incredible, brilliant man.  RIP Steve Jobs.  
&nbsp; Hi Apple,     My condolences on the loss of a Great man he will be sorely missed in all areas of the Apple world.     When someone dies that has changed, so fundamentally, the way we go about our daily lives   and the way we interact with each other then we have lost a true visionary and a inventive genius.     I have been an Apple devotee since the days of Apple IIc and have always loved the products ease of operation.  I now own several of Apples products and will always do so. I believe Steve says "It Just Works" and that is so true.     So, good bye Steve you will always be looking over your "baby" and guiding continually its progress.     RIP Steve Jobs...     A great Man.. A Great Life well lived... &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Sincerest condolences. May God give patience to the family and the ability &nbsp;to continue to do good in Steve's name. Steve's had a special place on my heart ever since I watched his commencement speech at stanford. God bless 
 Hello .... Sorry but I don't speak English, I'm Brazilian from Campinas/ São Paulo. I just want to say I'm sorry for the death of our dear Jobs. I am also the area of IT and know the importance that he is and has been for everyone. We just have to thank for everything he did, for his ideas for his talent.&nbsp;
We are an Apple family and will be forever.  We have a 10 year old son who has low functioning Autism.  The iPad is now changing his life and it is being used at school everyday to teach him new things. He absolutely loves his iPad and we hope eventually it will be able to talk for him.  We will be forever grateful for Steve Jobs and his vision for the world.  We are sad tonight.  We are a middle class hard working family and he has changed the way we live. Prayers to his family.
Thank you Steve Jobs for walking on this planet. You have been my biggest inspiration ever since I have heard of you. You have had many hardships in life, as have I, but you continued to pursue your visions, passions, and dreams and have become the greatest legend of our century. You showed how having a strong mindset and not giving up can lead to respect and success. Thank you for being such an inspiration to my life and everyone else's as well. It saddens me how my greatest inspiration has left this universe, but I will continue to hold you as an inspiration. 
The world's best-selling innovator and designer. No bull. On the other side of the world, I never met Steve, but wish I had. 
You were the Da Vinci of our time and we can only hope that new heroes will emerge from the footsteps you've left behind. Thank you. 
You don't know me, but I can truly say that you have inspired me to "live my life" and not what others want me to live.  You have touched millions and inspired us all.  I am in awe of what you were able to do in 56 short years.  You will be truly missed.  Thanks for leaving the world a better place.
Dear Steve. The world will never forget your contributions!  Rest-in-peace.
Steve Jobs, you will be missed. Rest in peace. Thanks for your many contributions to the world. You will never be forgotten, as your creativity and ideas will be with us for many years to come.&nbsp;
Steve has inspired me to take risks, innovate, and lead with my own business. He's made my life easier and my career more fruitful with his vision and creations.&nbsp;
The world has lost amazing character and leader who changed civilization direction.   Your great imagination will bear in mind of human being of this planet. Rest in Peace, Steve your APPLE is in my heart forever.&nbsp;
Steve did so much with his life.  I'm inspired to try harder.  Thanks Steve
To whom it may concern,  I am sending my deepest condolences for the loss of such a brilliant and world changing individual. He has definitely left a mark on this world through creativity and the ability to see great ideas through. He is a true inspiration for all.&nbsp;
  Steve muito obrigado por tudo fez para humanidade.    Fique bem onde estiver. 
Thanks for all you done for Apple, Been a Apple fan since 2006 when I switch from a pc, You will be missed, My thoughts and prayers goes out to his family. RIP Brother.
Dear Steve,  I'll always remember you as the man that inspired me to work in a technology  corporation seven years ago. Today, I fulfilled part of my dream as a worker in IBM. Unfortunately I'll never meet you as once I expected, however, in someway you brought magic to my life.  Rest in peace Steve and be sure that you'll live forever in the mind of one man.
Thank you for redefining the word innovation 
 I would like to extend my sincere condolences to Apple, its personnel and all that knew Steve on a personal basis. The effect Apple has had on the world under Steve's leadership is monumental. Apple is everywhere, touching people's lives regardless of race, religion, or other artificial variables used to fragment the unity that is humanity.  I believe Steve aspired to bring us all back together and used technology to bring forth a brighter future. And despite the economic shocks and tremors we experience today, the world is really bright and colorful thanks to Apple and Steve Jobs who channeled our minds toward the positive.  Blessed be his memory.
Dear Steve,  I know you in a better place. Im sure it was very hard to go through  what you did. I would just like to thank you for being a genuine person.  You created a system that people love so much. You are more than a  inventor, you inspire people everywhere. Because of you I have been  pursing my dream in Sports media. I use Mac's to edit highlight tapes, I  use the iPhone to keep my games scheduled, and i use my iPad to carry my  work with me everywhere I go. I thank you for everything you have done.  I will always miss you.  Pirates of Silicon Valley will always be my favorite movie. 
 Steve Jobs has influenced how people live their lives.    All the good he had done and all the bad that his technology had brought about are history.    Let’s remember him for his good.
Steve is the most greatly person to my knowledge. Who changed the world, really. I love Apple products invented by Jobs. I pray for Steve.
Hearts and prayers go to Steve's family. Steve, you brought the technology that has been the foundation to the world we live in. You will be missed...&nbsp;
We lost someone big today, someone that concluded his mission and will  leave his print for centuries. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish... 
Steve was someone that cannot be replaced, someone the world may never get a  chance to experience again. He was a man that had a passion for technology and has shaped the technology world to what it is today. There may be men that try to live up to him and make a fortune that will far surpass what he made. But they will never do it the way steve did. Today is a great day of sadness. As I type this email on my iPhone I will forever thank steve for giving  me a piece of technology that I can share with my children and for making my life so much easier, with every click on this phone I will forever remember him.
My 1st computer was a Apple IIGS  it was the best at the time, the loss of Mr. Jobs is truly a sad day for the everyone in the world, whether people know it or not he revolutionized the world; with is ideas and innovations and took it out of the dark ages.  No one else could have ever  done that I just wish that I would have got a chance to experience one day in the presents of this great mind, to everyone at apple that met and worked with Steve jobs you are the blessed one's that got to meet a great inspiration and thinker.   My condolences to his family and loved one's.
I come to my house today and I see the news, a legends die...My heart stops for a second, I can't believe the guy who I look up to... I just have one product of Apple, one Iphone 2G, because is too much hard to buy a iPhone, or iPad here on Brazil...But I'm very sad about that, I hope he is with God, he left a history, the innovative technology.  My condolences to the family of Steve and everyone at Apple. A big hug from Brazil, we'll pray for him.&nbsp;
I consider myself a member of a very fortunate generation who witnessed the doings of a modern prophet. His vision of linking Art and computers will continue to shape our world forever...
I would like to say thank you, you're the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We will miss you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
My respects for Steve Job's family and friends. The world knows how much of a loss we're having today. Steve was more than just a mortal man, he was a spirit of innovation, creativity and vision. His ideas and his perspective of world and life are lessons to be learned. Wherever you are Steve, we're with you. 
Rest in peace Steve, thank you for having the courage to change the world.
Steve,  You were a true visionary.  Our family will miss you very much.
Dear Steve,     Whilst I am learning the way of your presentation, with power but of clarity, then this morning when I wake up I heard of such a shocking news which hit me much, losing such a spiritual and influential leader.  Life is full of ups and downs and it is not how long you live which makes it count, it's how meaningful you create your life when you are still alive.     Rest in peace and my best wishes to you and your family.&nbsp;
    My sincere condolences to Apple on the passing of Steve Jobs...  He certainly will be remembered forever, for giving the mobile technology a  new life, new style in the form of Smart Phones! We love Apple!            
The world has lost the single most important, influential revolutionary of modern times. My heart goes out to his family and colleagues at Apple. I'm truly sorry.  The world is better place because of Steve and his visions and the good he has left behind. God bless you Steve.&nbsp;
RIP Steve. &nbsp;Thanks for all you did for us. You will be missed.
Apple, under the leadership and vision of Steve Jobs, has changed the   world as we know it. In the world of Digital Filmmaking, we have pioneered through   countless advances with the aid of Apple hardware, software and   networking. Steve Jobs will be missed by his collective digital family, not just   because of the toys he gave us, but for the vision he shared and   inspired us with.
Hello,  My deepest condolences and prayers&nbsp;go out to the Jobs family, Apple and  Pixar.&nbsp;I am saddened to hear about Mr. Jobs passing. I have been an  Apple user since 2006. I know what it is like to lose someone with  cancer.&nbsp;My mother passed away in June 1991 at&nbsp;the age of 51 of cancer. I think the most significant thing I will remember about&nbsp;Mr. Jobs, is  his obvious contributions to how we live our lives and perform our jobs.  If it weren't for the advancements in technology though his visions, our  lives would be significantly different. And a thank you to those that  worked so hard to make his visions come to life. Steve Jobs will be  missed.&nbsp;Thank you Steve. You will be missed.
It has been my extreme pleasure to work for the company that this truly  amazing man created. You are the most innovative person to grace this  planet in many years. I can honestly say that, even though I never met  you, I love you and your beautiful  mind.
Steve Jobs was a true genius. He translated his visions into reality in such creative ways. His inspiration was just the beginning, as his legacy continues through the creative people at Apple.&nbsp;
"It just works." Thanks.
Thank you for all you've brought to us. &nbsp;
My first Apple was an Apple II+ with 48k(!) later expanded to 64 so I could play Wizardry(!!). Thus began a lifelong love for all things Apple.  As I type this note on my iPad 2, my iPhone 4 sitting beside me, I am frankly astounded at how saddened I feel personally at the passing of Steve Jobs. Though I  never met the man, I am profoundly touched by his vision, genius, and creativity. The world will miss you sir.  Thank you for all you've given us.  Rest in true peace.
Steve Jobs was the greatest and the smartest person alive on this planet. He has a special place in my heart. I will miss him a lot. I loved Steve Jobs, and today I've lost a member of my family.  R.I.P Steve Jobs.
I am a musician and film maker, who grew up in the computer age that  Steve Jobs helped create.  His innovations help me to express myself,  organize my thoughts and communicate on a daily basis.  I think the real reason people love Apple products is because they have become so  integrated into our lives as they create new possibilities for the human  experience, not to just crunch numbers as computers were orinignally  created to do.  Even if you aren't using an Apple product on a daily  basis, you are living in a world that has forever been changed and  influenced by Steve Jobs and the company he co-founded.  He is our  Wright Brothers, Henry Ford, Madame Currie and Thomas Edison and history  will only increase his stature.
Thank you for everything !!!! You are my eternal teacher !!!  You are the one!!!  Rest in peace!!&nbsp;
My first design job was using this new mac computers in 1992. I got my first mac in 1995. I teach my 2 years old daughter to use our mac in 1999... and she learned...  Forever been thankful for his vision and legacy.
What a great man and innovator, he will&nbsp;truly&nbsp;be missed, RIP Mr. Jobs.
Thank you Steve for not only being a great innovator, but a great man!
Steve,  I want to thank you for inspiring me to dream, awake, act, create, live, give, help and love.
A man that made a huge difference. RIP Steve.
Thanks Steve.  You made the world a better place !!!  May you rest in peace.  We will miss you.&nbsp;
     People like Steve change history .... Not only do part of it, they dictate how history should be written ..... miss him ... I never met him in person .... but his creativity has invaded and changed the world including my life .....       His dicipulos has an obligation to continue writing this story and keep the constant change and evolution proposed by him ...       His greatest quality was to be bold and creative .... His greatest fault was to be bold and creative ...... Rest in Peace &nbsp;
My deepest simpathy from one who lived the transformation of the world lead  by Steve Jobs, it's clearly one day that we won't forget because there was  still a lot of work to do but the leadership is there.  I'll never forget my first. thanks for all the memories.&nbsp;
HIS SPIRIT CARRIES ON!&nbsp;
I am not some well know celebrity. I am just one of those people who's first computer was an Apple II and have been a follower of Steve for all these many years. I doubt anyone will even seen this post.  But if ever there was someone to admire in this country, it was Steve Jobs. He had a vision. He insisted on doing things right. He followed his dreams and both failed and succeeded.  I never met Steve, but I personally feel a great loss.  I want to thank Steve for the effect he has made on my life (and many others) without even realizing it.  Steve was not just a businessman. Not just a visionary. Not just a dreamer. He wanted to make a mark on our worlds, and he did. He made our lives better.  God Bless you Steve Jobs. &nbsp; &nbsp;
Dear Apple Team,   I am very sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs.  He was a great CEO, and made Apple the strongest and most recognizable company in the world.  He will forever be in my heart.  Whenever I look at an Apple product, I see Steve Jobs, the smartest and most AMAZING man in the world.  Once again, I am very sorry for your loss.&nbsp;
Steve, you have enhanced the lives of the world. Without your genius, I could not work so efficiently from my MacBook Pro. Without your genius, I could not listen to the worlds musical offerings whereever I go on my IPOD. Without your genius, I could not communicate with the word so efficiently on my IPHONE. Without your genius, I could not be entertained on demand with my Apple TV.   You have done your job. Rest in peace because you deserve it. You should be a happy being wherever you are.&nbsp;
The products that he was the creative genius behind have literally changed the way I go through my everyday life. I can only hope that Apple can continue to generate technology to change the way we go through life the way Steve has. He will be deeply missed. 
Steve,Thank you for showing me a new world! Rest in peace.
Steve will be missed...that is such an under statement. We will never know the true impact his great mind has had and will continue to have on our everyday lives. He should serve as a beacon for true passion in doing a job above and beyond what is expected and to challenge us to push the impossible to reality.    
Though my career has nothing to do with information technology, my life has been improved with iDevices, and I am so much indebted to Steve Jobs. I will remember him not only as a creative leader of Apple, but also as the one who contributed greatly to the history of IT. His phenomenal products and  speeches will surely be remembered by every user of iDevices all over the world. Rest in peace.     
   Thanks for your leadership,your vision, your inspiration and strength. Your legacy will live on forever.
You mean so much to all the entrepreneurs in this world.  You remind all of us why we are doing what we do.  You remind all of us how important it is to push our lives forward without giving up.  Although you are not here anymore, you are still our driving force.  Thank you and goodbye.&nbsp;
He has been a great human being, i will never forget him. Thanks for all the excitement and you have truly change a lot of things in this world.
Fear. That's how I first felt when I sat down in front of an IBM PC. But then came along the Apple Macintosh. And the Fear went away.  Over the years, regardless of what people said in my gut  I knew there was magic at Apple because of Steve Jobs.  He wasn't just a CEO but a person with a dream and he shared it with all of  us.  I hope that magic continues...  He is now with the Super Computer in the sky.  God Bless 
 Absolute genius. You will be missed.  
Steve Jobs was an incredible leader. He started up Apple in his garage  in Silicon Valley, and from the release of the first Macintosh, he led  the computer industry for three decades. I looked up to him as an  inspiration, for I wanted to follow in his footsteps and change the  world.  R.I.P Steve, you will be missed. 
Dear Steve,  thank you for your Impressions.  We will miss you.
He was a brilliant man there will never be another like him R.I.P. Steve Jobs&nbsp;
Dear Apple &amp; Steve's family,  We are very sorry to hear about your lost. Our deepest sympathy, thoughts and prayers are with you all. May Steve's soul rest in peace. Even though we didn't know Steve personally but he had change the way we think of technology. He is a genius and amazing human being. We love &amp; respect him. He will be always in our thoughts and always be part of our life.
I am deeply saddened. My heart goes out to the family and the world. What Steve gave to us all is beyond words. An incredible loss to mankind.  I am honored to have lived in Silicon Valley and to have been a part of its greatness. The world will never be the same. My deepest condolences to the family.
Thank you Steve, for creating one of the most visionary products in possibly  all of united states history. I was literally in tears after hearing about your death. And truly to me you were an American Hero. Bravo. May god have placed you into the most heavenly part of heaven. God bless you Mr.Jobs. 
May you rest in peace. You will never be forgotten. You will always be in our hearts. 
RIP Steve Jobs. There are no words to thank you for introducing the iPad to the market - for giving my four Autistic children a voice, a form of communication, before they were able to speak. God Bless. &nbsp;
The brain child of Steve jobs, Apple Inc. has changed my life in many  ways.  My first computer was an Apple IIGs my father bought second hand  when I was 9.  It opened the doors of computing to me and stimulated my  interest in technology.  For a while after I was inundated with PC's in  school and at home.  Apple had become foreign to me.  When I was 19 I  got a job at a small concrete precaster business where all the computers  were Imacs, things just worked well in that office - largely due to the  functionality and ease of use of Apple computers.  When I got accepted  to Cornell University in 2007 and left my job the first thing I did was  purchase a MacBook Pro with the help of my grandfather, the very  computer I am typing this on today.  I will never go back to a PC.   Steve Jobs, you have changed my life for the better with your ideas,  products, and spirit.  Thank you.  RIP.&nbsp;
From my first iPhone to my first Mac to my next iPhone 4S. Every time I switch them on I will remember your brilliance. Steve, you were and always will be my idol. I will never ever forget you. RIP Steve Jobs.
Words can't describe the lasting impact Steve has left on the world. My condolences to his family and friends.&nbsp;
It's a sad day indeed. Thank you Steve for being you. My thoughts and prayers go out to Steve's Family and those I knew and worked  with at Apple for so many years who are still my friends today. God's Speed.
Steve Jobs embedded himself into history.  When I think of how Steve Jobs will be remembered I think of when I was in school learning about the great  innovators throughout time.  Generations of people after us, years from now  will learn about how Steve Jobs changed the world.  I'm just happy that I  was along for the ride!  RIP Steve.
A mentor that I never met...  Steve changed the way I look at the world. In a deeper way than I can ever explain.  For that I am eternally indebted to him. Please pass on my most sincere condolences to his family.
Thoughts and prayers to Steve's family on this sad day. His visions changed our lives. He will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
 Today I graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Graphic Design, and my thesis I have fully processed to my good old macBook pro that I have from four years! Without the brain, the imagination, humility and passion of Steve would not be where I am now. I offer my condolences to the family, first and foremost, and to the great company that Apple has lost the sole creator and founder. I dedicate my thesis, I could never accomplish what I've done!! love you Steve,in your honor.
We were profoundly saddened by the loss of Steve Jobs. A compassionate, humanitarian, great innovator, brilliant mind. May his soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
It was in 1995 that I bought my first Mac.  Macintosh, PowerBook G3, iMac, numerous versions of iBook and iPod, now MacBook Pro. These are the Apple products that helped enrich my life. I cannot imagine a day without Apple. Thank you, Steve Jobs. RIP.
I just can't believe it. He was a genius.  I remember that when I had to prepare a presentation for university  first time,  I used to watch his inspiring keynotes again and again. He  presented the products in a way which made you simply convince. The connection between a company and a customer would have never been so  close and emotional if there was no Steve Jobs.  He will always be remembered as one of the greatest personalities of  this and last century.  Thanks for making our lives much happier, Steve.
It is tragic to have lost a man of genius so young. He made a big  difference to my life. My deepest condolences to his family.&nbsp;
Your work changed generations, lives, and made the future. Thanks for bringing us all to live in it with you.&nbsp;
Dear Everyone at Apple,  After watching a fabulous product launch yesterday I was stunned to hear  the news today that Steve Jobs passed away.  To those of you who knew him personally you have my sincerest  condolences.  You must be heart broken.  To the Apple Family I want to say that your products are incredible and  your company is a shining example of what a company should be.  The way  you care for your customers and the service at your stores, the passion  and the training that your employees have is equally matched by your  customers.  We care about you because you care about us and you make our  lives and the world a better place.  You don't make the world a better place because you create a fun gadget.   You make the world a better place because you strive for excellence in  everything you do.  You don't settle for improving upon the competitions  product.  You don't rush a piece of metal to the market place just to  make a deadline.  You make an excellent product the looks good, that is fun to use, that  helps us live better more productive lives (even when we don't fully  utilize the product as much as we could).  I can communicate with my  family on the other side of the country.  I can see my Mom's face when  she talks to me.  I can listen to music all day long without disturbing  my co-workers.  I can record my music, make and edit my movies, and do  my finances all on one fast easy to use machine so that I don't have to  hire a professional to do this for me.  I thank you for your products.  I thank you for your company.  I thank  you for showing the world what the word EXCELLENCE means.  I look forward to seeing you grow and the change the future of the  world.  God Bless Steve Jobs for showing us how to do it right.&nbsp;
 Thanks for changed the world. You will be the best man of Tech. forever. We' ll miss you Steve 
In about 1980 I switched from a Heath H-8 to an Apple ][+, and Apple  pretty much just kept getting better while Jobs was anywhere near the  helm. We'll miss him.
I remember the days when we used to fight, convincing people to convert  to Apple. We don't anymore because you came back to Apple and changed  things even more.  You are my hero.  We will miss you.  You saw 10 years ahead of everyone.  I can't believe you are gone, I thought you were going to rest and be  there. I have just about every Apple and Mac except the Lisa and the emate. 
I'm grateful, Steve Jobs. I'm so sad. Have been your biggest fan for 30 odd years. Been buying almost every Apple product ever launched coz I truly believed. Rest in peace. You are a truly amazing human being.
You have created a legacy of products that have made my life and that of my families SO much better.  You have allowed us to captures memories in movies, memories in photos, and our countless apple photo albums will be our constant reminder of how one man brought us so much joy!  Rest in peace Steve.
You know, I'm writing here because I have dreams and that man has changed my life. I'm crying right now, from the other side of the world, with my bad English, to pronounce my feelings. My feelings that I know just the Apple fans can understand. Steve was an amazing human being. He changed my heart and taught me the meaning of my life. I'm only 17, I learned with this man things that no one could. He  could have a beautiful life continuation from here, but his legacy already  won an era. My heart goes for his family, his closest friends and all the ones who he touched.  Because he's the man who made me cry for somebody I never met, but I didn 't need to know him to know how magical he is and forever will be. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, my hero.&nbsp;
I would like to send my condolences to the family of Steve Jobs, and also the family at Apple. &nbsp;No man I can think of in modern history has made such a difference in the daily lives of so many people. &nbsp;His work has helped all of us connect with each other and the world. &nbsp;Although I never met him, it was obvious that his pleasant smile and demeanor touched everyone. &nbsp;He will be missed in so many ways by so many people.  God Bless and Rest in Peace.
Thank you, Steve for all your creations that have helped shaped our world.&nbsp; Rest in peace.&nbsp;
 He will be forever in our memories! Hope his spirit stays with all of you and gives you power to keep on way! I just can say thanks to Steve and to you to give us the opportunity of the future!&nbsp;
A sinking feeling comes. And there is nothingness for a while. Grief takes over. The price for knowing Love. We are human. Thank the gods for the gifted, for they touch the masses.  Bless, bless to those closest to Steve.&nbsp;
R.I.P. Steve Jobs. He is one of the reasons why I do what I do today.&nbsp;
 People like Steve Jobs don't come along very often. He was a man of pure genius who inspired us to think different.  You will be sadly missed. My condolences to his family.
You are my role model and I will never forget you. I will miss you dearly. Even though I never met you... you've touch all our hearts with your kindness and innovative ways of thinking.&nbsp;
I worked at Apple for 4 years at one of the retail store - something  outside of my personality. I tend to jump around a lot from place to  place and try to live my life off of "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish" The  culture at Apple is what kept me there. I moved on not because I didn't  love it or the culture or being part of innovation that truly made a  dent in the Universe but because I chose to " Stay Hungry and Foolish".  This is part of the legacy Apple &amp; Steve had on me. To look at the  normal, the old, the worn down and see it differently. To always push,  simplify, and strip down to the essence of anything and find the beauty.  Apple embodies this, Steve embodies this and I'll always live my life by  it.
The world has lost a great manhe was an innovator and a technical thinker, which is something to be admired. I feel for you all there at Apple. May he be remembered for the great things he did and revolutionized the world. 
We will all miss him. He was an amazing man with so many good ideas.
I can't even begin to explain how much this news has moved me. Since I was a little kid, I had always aspired to be an innovator, a forward thinker, a game changer. Steve Jobs was the one man I could always look to for inspiration, and seeing him pass today is heart breaking. I remember the joys of getting my first PowerBook G4, reloading the internet in class to see when the latest keynote would be posted, and going into the Apple store to play with the new machinery he so directly influenced. From reshaping the personal computing industry, to inventing the media platform, to introducing the world to the next-generation mobile standard, Jobs has had a lasting influence on the world that will not be shaken off any time soon.  I wasn't surprised that I welled up when I read the news about Steve's passing away. I've become so dazzled by the visionary that any less would have not been appropriate for me. It's my duty to pay my respects to the man who truly changed the world as we know it.  A Da Vinci of modern times. Thanks for everything, Steve.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for building a company that proves it can be done in America... we just have to get out there and do it. And for teaching us all that life begins where your comfort zone ends.  RIP.
My Hero, I miss you and remember you forever. 
Just as usual,  today I was woken by a great song of iPhone. I received the news of his death from my macbook air,  and I listened to musics over iPod on my way out.  I'm staying with him all the time, just as usual.  Thanks.
RIP Steve Jobs - you were a genius and an inspiration.  You revolutionized our lives.  God bless.
I have been looking up to you and your creations since I was 5 years old. I am 24 today. My whole life has been built and shaped by machines that have come together from your visions. My professional life is only possible because of hardware and software that was once just a thought in your head and a vision for a better tomorrow. My personal life is more fun and enjoyable because of your want and need for a personal computer to be exactly that: personal.   I want to keep this short, as I cannot continue to write through the tears. There is no way to describe what impact you have had on my life, as someone that you've never met and will never know, but I thank you for everything that you have done.  Rest in Peace, Steve.  Thank you.&nbsp;
Thank you for make this world better with your passion.  Thank you for being an inspiration for our generation. You've connected your last point. Goodbye Steve.
I am extremely sad to hear that Steve Jobs has passed away. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. RIP Mr. Jobs, you will be missed. The technology world will be a different place without him.&nbsp;
One of the top creative minds of the modern age, will be greatly missed. 
Steve extended a hand to me in a time when I was running out of options. His apple products introduced me to a whole frontier to channel my design skills thru. Expressing my creativity, conveying stories, sharing photos, illustrations and publishing stories made such an impact on me and all those who became apple fans...became Steve Jobs fans.  Steve shared in his vision a plan for what could and should be before we knew we needed or wanted it. Eventually we came to expect great things from the company and no doubt never appreciated all the hard work and sacrifices all involved gave to make those products, those visions.    Behind every great company and leader, stands a loyal, equally passionate crew of hard working staff. Remember your client base is behind you and support you.  A life-long apple fan.     
I have only ever used the Apple equipment and, of course, had no connection with Mr. Jobs, and yet, here I am in an Apple store and I feel a loss. Mr. Jobs will be missed as an inspiring entrepreneur in so many ways.
Rest in Peace Mr. Steve Jobs... I may not own an Iphone or IPAD now, but even though you'll not be here to create another genius invention, i will still continue to save and have a remembrance of your creation in the near future...May your soul be with our Creator...God bless your family.
My sincere condolences to the Jobs family.  Steve you have touched and changed the world forever. Your dreams, aspirations, spirit and soul will live on forever.
Thanks Steve for all you have done. This world is a better place because  you lived. May your soul rest in perpetual peace. My condolences goes  out to your family. 
  The world has lost one of the founding fathers of home computing,  without whom we would not have half the devices that we have today.  I would like to send my deepest and most sincere condolences to his Family.  Rest in peace Sir, you shall be forever missed and remembered.
To all those Who Knew &amp; Loved Steve Jobs  My condolences  I always thought the Apple Logo was such a flash of brilliance  The Apple was always the symbol .. I thought ... of Wisdom  When Eve offered Adam the Apple the image I believe is the image of  one  offering Wisdom  Surely Steve Jobs gave to us .. the world...  the gift of Wisdom  His Wisdom .. unique and brilliant. Thank you Steve you taught me to love my computer and so gave me the gift of Wisdom  Love &amp; Light.
Few can say they touched the world...even fewer can say they transformed the world...and even fewer can say they did what Steve did...surprised our imagination...allowed us to expand our vision of how we communicate, play and create! RIP SJ.
We   did not have Steve's intelligence or vision. We did not borrow or have to learn his intelligence. Steve took his genius and packaged it in a wonderful way that allowed us to use his mind and creations...then share them with our family, friends, and total strangers. Steve made the world smaller with a voice near common. His work changed humanity forever. His Apple logo was the graphic of the temptation of the beginning... and until  now left a wonderful taste in our mouths.
I am pretty sure that Steve changed the world for the better with his ideas but I am absolutely sure that his ideas changed my world for the better.
Dear Steve and Family,  I would like to thank you for being part of our daily lives. You are a  great technology innovator. I wish I have met you in person but I  already did, by my apple products. I feel really sad because you made an impact in my life. You will be missed.  Thank you Steve. Will pray for your soul. &nbsp;
For remind us that the most important on our life is the imagination to dream and the strength to make those dreams come true.  Keep dreaming.&nbsp;
Thank You Steve. You changed the face of the world.  You changed our outlook at life or  communication with others and cultivated the desire for us all to excel.   Thank You Steve.  We all wish we knew you better in one way or another,  but we can all have a connection to you simply by the wonderful  creations you dreamed.  I thank you, Steve thank you.
I would like to say that this is an incredibly sad situation. Steve Jobs  was a brilliant man who brought his talent, creativity and amazing  ability to make Apple what it is today. Rest in peace Steve Jobs. I hope  you are in a lovely, safe place. And thank you Apple for everything, I absolutely love my Macbook Pro.
Steve you brought bright colors to life! It was a treat walking in the light  of your imagination! We will miss you.
I'm sure this mailbox is full of message of condolences and praise   for this great man - all richly deserved and I whole heartedly   concur.  I would just like to add my thanks - his inspired vision is   a thing of beauty and enduring.  Rest in peace Mr. Jobs.
Our deepest condolences go out to Mr. Jobs' family, friends, and coworkers. We are absolutely in shock at his passing.   We are grateful for all that he developed, and all that he contributed to this world, and wish his successors all the best in continuing on with his vision, and innovations.
I am so sorry about Steve. My family members are huge Apple customers and are deeply saddened by the passing away of Steve Jobs. We hope that you continue his legacy the way he would have wanted it, by continuing to be one of the best companies in the world today.&nbsp;
Thanks for all that you did to make the world a better place. You will be missed.
I'm from Bogota Colombia, a South American city, and today I feel so bad for this news. To my thinking he was an spectacular human being, who was able to make to feel people connected with the technology, like me. You don't know how my life changed since I had my iPod, it is my new land. I only wish that Steve Jobs' family could overcome this event. And remember: now he is in our memories, he is living in our minds and its never change.
Individuals such as Steve Jobs are very rare and we are lucky that he was here during our lifetime.   His contributions will be felt and appreciated for generations and he will be greatly missed.  Thank you,  Steve.   Godspeed.
Steve, you changed the world. Changed the life of millions. The Smartphone industry is what it is today, just because of your hard work. Your perfectionism. Your determination.&nbsp;And I can only say: Thank You.&nbsp;Your devices changed my life, improved my experience on this world.Thanks Steve. 
Dear Steve,  You are a true modern day Leonardo Da Vinci. Thanks a million for making our life easier and better in many ways. Though you are not there with us today but you will remain in our mind and heart forever and ever.  May your soul rest in peace and harmony.
My condolences to his family and friends. He will be forever be part of our lives as he will be remembered for all the great things he done in his short lifetime. Truly a genius of our times.
As a member of the Apple Family. My Blessings and Prayers go out to his Family, Friends, Colleagues. His body is not with us, however his Spirit is with many of us and will continue to live on forever. He hasn't gone anywhere, but here with us in a different way, as he would want it.&nbsp;
Hi all,  Today all of us have lost a genius. This genius has made a better world  with his ideas and visions, and I`m feeling like I`ve lost a family  member. Steve, you now are in better place than all of us, probably laughing and  thinking about your legacy left to Apple and us, your fans. Rest in peace and thanks for all you did. I've become an apple fan just  because of you.&nbsp;
Steve and family,  You will be missed, I hope that it was peaceful.   my heart broke when I heard the news  I hope that your vision and creativity will be carried on.  I am forever an Apple fan, You are responsible for that.&nbsp;
My first mac was a Lisa at around age 10.  From then, I've been a Mac user.  I grew up with each newer Apple computer as it was released (thank my dad for this!!).  Thanks to Steve for his innovation, vision, and creativity! The world will miss you.
   He was the best entrepreneur, he inspire me to study by my own. He inspire me to make the thinks i like to make, He inspire me to find the thinks i liked to make. He know inspire me to change the world,  Thanks Steve Jobs. 
 We have lost a man, who became a icon, for the computer industry, As John Lennon was for music. Bye Steve.
I don't think anyone has affected my digital life so directly as Steve Jobs has. His vision was unparalleled, something we witness maybe once in a 100 years. Quite frankly, Steve changed the world. He showed me it was ok to dream big, to think differently. His commencement speech at Stanford a few years ago should be a must read for every single person...it has some of the most valuable lessons you can learn about life. Apple products are a thing of beauty with a personality....something that is not matched by any other material item. His soul is in every one of them. As I type this email on my Mac, after receiving the sad news on my iPhone.... there is no denying that his affect will remain with me for the rest of my life.  We will miss you Steve. A world has lost a great human being. 
I would like to express my deepest condolence to Steve Jobs family due to the death of Steve Jobs. May your soul rest in peace. Thank you for everything. You had make the world a better place with ur invention of new technology.
Steve,<div>Thanks for all you have done!  You have inspired me as a small business owner to think differently and to focus on the end product and make it as client centered as possible. I am in the financial services industry and the end product is really my advice to my clients. I believe that advice and the delivery of that advice has been positively influenced by you.  I am sure Walt Disney is welcoming you home for some great discussions. I will not say the words "rest in peace" as I know you did not like to rest. But may you be at peace!</div>
Dear Sir  I really love Steve Jobs. I really love Macintosh. I really love Apple.   Thank you very much Steve. You are always in my life.  Thank you very much. &nbsp;
Now you can relax and see your legacy! Well done Steve, well done and thank  you!!!&nbsp;
 I remember your passion. I remember your dream. Bye Steve.&nbsp;
RIP.  You have changed the world.  Thanks for all the innovations and amazing products.
Thanks for making this a better world to live in, Steve.  Rest in peace.
Dear Steve:  Thanks for providing us another option of personal computer to choose from.&nbsp;
I'm sorry about your loss, great loss to humanity in general Apple in particular.
Thank you for the most intelligent words I have ever heard.   "Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life…Everything else is secondary."       
A sad and significant loss for the world over.  Sincerest condolences to his family, friends, and all of his colleagues at Apple.&nbsp;
I've been a fan of Apple for years and I love what Steve has done for  Apple, Only 4 years ago I was able to buy my first  iPhone and I haven't  stopped ever sines buying one every time there is a new one. After that  I had to have everything Apple, I have all my family and friends hooked  on Apple products and I know all of this is because of all the hard work  Steve put into the Apple company. Steve Jobs you will be missed and my  condolences go out to your family. 
You will always be remembered.  
I'm using one of the visions that Steve innovated to write this..the Ipad.  He is a man that went beyond technology..and made us all realize what dreams are made of, and what following your heart can achieve.  What an inspiration and what a loss...  RIP Mr. Jobs.  And thank you for what you have done for us.&nbsp;
 Forever Love.!!             
If it weren't for Steve Jobs and the team at Apple, I wouldn't be  sending this email and enjoying my Macbook Pro. I also like to think  getting my first iPod was an important turning point in my life.  My condolences. 
My well wishes, thoughts and prayers go out to Mr. Jobs and his family. We (humanity as a whole) have lost a great man who has moved mankind forward so much in such a short period of time.  Although Apple and its products never really appealed to me, I always respected the passion, dedication and never ending attention to detail that Mr. Jobs brought to everything he ever worked with or on. The interesting thing is that it is this mantra of his that has slowly started to change even someone as stubborn as I am and make change my thoughts on Apple.  May he rest in peace and may his family and friends find peace and pride with being related to a man that will no doubt be written about in history books as one of the greatest men of all time.&nbsp;
Thank you for being such an amazing entrepreneur and an inspiring human being overall.  You will be greatly missed.  Thank you for everything you have done, you will not be forgotten.  My husband bought me my first MacBook last year for Christmas and I am now a Mac user for life - all thanks to your vision and perseverance.
A Genius, thank you Jobs for transform the world with your amazing ideas...
Thanks for bringing back some humanity to computing.  Truly one of the  great visionaries of the baby boomer generation.&nbsp;
May you rest in peace Steve.  In so many ways you helped usher into everyday use the technology that helped define the world my generation grew up in during the 1980s. You were one of those special people that helped change the very shape of the world we live in. I, like countless others, have been inspired by you, followed your career with fascination and will miss you. I know I am but one anonymous voice out of millions whom you never met in this life, but it is with deep sadness that I bid you farewell and extend my sympathies to your family, friends, and colleagues. May your "insanely great" spirit always live on.
I would like to thank Steve for the imagination he has instilled, the breakthroughs he has made, the foundations he has built and the innovations he has pioneered. You don't have to be a fan of Apple products to know how truly amazing steve was. He changed the world and the way we think. He made me believe that any task can always be done better. The world has said goodbye to one of the greatest minds that ever set foot on earth, he is not just a mentor to his employees but a mentor to the people.  I am truly saddened by this news.  What a great man! That's all that can be said. RIP Steve, your up in the iClouds now!
The City of York Pennsylvania may not be Silicon Valley, but Steve Jobs made  us feel like we could share the same vision and dream the same future.  Our thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of Mr. Jobs at this  difficult time.
 I wasn't too big of an Apple fan, but this news is sad regardless. Steve Job s was great (I mean GREAT) at what he did, and I hope Apple remains successful even without him.
I am so sorry about Steve. My family are huge Apple customers and are deeply saddened by the passing away of Steve Jobs. We hope that you continue his legacy the way he would have wanted it, by continuing to be one of the best companies in the world today.&nbsp;
I would just like to say that Steve Jobs changed my life for the better. Without him I don't know what I would be doing right now. This morning, the day when Jobs passed away, my friends were talking about how Macs weren't as good as Windows, but that day, I defended him. I defended his intelligence and the impact he has made on so many lives. It's a sad thing to hear that this wonderful intelligent person went with the wind like many others these past few years, but at least he chose to found the company that would change technology forever... Steve Jobs was an indescribably great person, and we all hope that he will rest in peace
Our deepest condolences go out to the Jobs Family. Thank you for sharing Steve with the world.
Steve Jobs was a great man and was a very inspiration person to many people. He will truly be missed by all.&nbsp;
Even though we all knew Steve was ill, hearing the news of his passing is most shocking to the extent I felt it personally.  He changed our lives with his incredible vision which resonated in his beautiful products and in my case being a 60 year old apple user and admirer I can only think that he has  left the weird and confusing world in a better place.  Rest well good man and best to all his loved ones..   
We would like to express our deepest sympathy. Thousand thanks Steve for having changed our way of thinking and working.  We will always remember you. We are very sad.&nbsp;
Steve jobs is IMMORTAL.  Still he lives by his wonderful invention APPLE.
Nunca fui um macmaniaco, mas sempre amei e amo o que Steve Jobs fez pela informatica, fez o pessoal enxergar diferente a musica, as animacoes, o design.... Ele foi um homem que fez historia, ele sera lembrado para sempre, sinto como alguem da minha familia tivesse partido! :(  Fique com Deus e descanse em paz mestre Jobs.&nbsp;
I sincerely can't say that I would be the same person today without your  influence. Thank you, Steve. I'll stay hungry, and always be foolish.  Rest in peace.
You have left us a huge legacy the will take a very long time to be equal. Your enthusiasm for your company, product and service is head and shoulders above what anybody else has ever accomplished.  You will be missed by all. 
A man who invented a career only to have been released for the hopes of  better leader, visionary and CEO finds himself back where he began his  work to change the world as we know it.  Today is a huge loss for the  world to see a world class man, mentor, icon father, husband, friend and  inventor pass before his time.  I am Sorry for this loss as I write this  email on my macbook pro.
    Steven Jobs, It is your life that gives me inspiration in my own.  I want to thank you for being part of my life in so many ways, and I am saddened that the world has lost you.  May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Recently i bought a macbook pro and i love it, He made a lot of things  for us for the people and he changed the world. Thank You Steve.&nbsp;
I became a computer tech because of my love for apple computers. after  23 years the sadness at his loss is only measured in the heartbeat of my  life.&nbsp;
It's a sad day but thank you for changing the world. Let's continue the dream.&nbsp;
He was a great guy and the founder of one of the most successful  companies in the world.  We will miss him. 
We will miss you..! you were simply genius. May your soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve gave to his audience, beyond the customers of his ideas.  Steve gave to the world, new vision.  new standards, new paradigms.  Joy is what Steve sought and attained for his audience.  Thank you Steve for the JOY, as i type on my MacBook pro.  Thanks for changing our life.
I want to send my deepest condolances to Mr. Jobs' wife, children and extended  Apple family.&nbsp; How blessed we all were to be directly and indirectly affected by  Steve Jobs and his amazing vision&nbsp;for the future and some really cool stuff.&nbsp;  I'm 50 but I don't think I'm too old to say THANK YOU STEVE, for all the cool  things you've created and allowed me to experience.&nbsp; Because there is the iPad  2, moving 2000 miles away from my family, is&nbsp;"ok" as you've&nbsp;created a way for&nbsp;me  to keep in touch and see them - even my 75 yr old mom who was once afraid her  computer was going to get "an infection" now has an Apple computer and can  facetime with me (a miracle).&nbsp;&nbsp; My fiance travels for weeks/months at a time and  now we can see each other daily.&nbsp; For that,&nbsp;I owe you huge!&nbsp; You make long  absences tolerable.&nbsp; You'll never know how much that has eased the pain of being  far away from those I love. &nbsp; Were you able to get Facetime to work in heaven so your family can continue to  have you close?&nbsp; I sure hope so.&nbsp; If anyone could figure out how to make that  happen Steve, it would be YOU! &nbsp; GOD BLESS YOU and your family!!!
I'm sure that I feel the same as many Apple fans in saying that we will miss his genius as well as his humor and perseverance, Steve epitomizes all that's good in business leadership with none of the bad. He will be missed by all the people he touched, which is pretty much everyone around the world.&nbsp;
Hello, I just wanted to send condolences to his family and his work family. We have been fans of his work for many years. My daughter would say she loves the iphones..me its the itouch/ipod.There are not enough words to describe what he did for our ears(music) &amp; communication! Thank you for letting us express our sympathies this way. He'll probably take over wherever he is and change things up;) We lost a great person today... &nbsp;
Thank you for making me remember that one person has the power to change everything!!! You are my role model!!!! I hope one day I can influence so positively on someone like you did on me!!!  Hope to see you later!!!!! 
A great human being like him, even not only him, could change the world, would not meet his demise, but, however, he did...&nbsp;
You made the world a better place Steve Jobs. Rest in Eternal peace.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,  Steve Jobs was a great man who changed the world and will be remembered forever. Throughout history he has made ground breaking innovations that have set standards so high that no-one will ever come close to, with the help of Apple. I want to thank him for all of his hard work and he did an amazing job at what he did. I hope that he never worked a day in his life because he loved what he did. I will always remember him and always look up to him. Steve Jobs, thank you and rest in peace. 
I'm honored to be a part of the generation that saw Steve Jobs and Apple  literally change our world!  I stand in awe of the technological  revolution that he was a part of, and that still continues through Apple  and other companies inspired by the work of Apple. I can't imagine life without Apple products, it has become so ingrained  in our culture; and not just ours (Americans), but the culture of the  world. What a visionary.  What a genius. &nbsp;Thank you to Steve Jobs, for making the world a better place!      
But I know that he is a genuine as he appeared.  He cared and it showed.   I never met him, but I will miss him.&nbsp;
 This century's Leonardo Di Vinci. &nbsp;You will be missed.
We would like to extend our condolences, thoughts and prayers to Steve's immediate and extended families. I greatly appreciate the company and it's products that Steve and his team have created.   The work he has done has improved the quality of life for everyone in any number of manners.     The world is better off having known Steve Jobs.  Which is as much as any of us can hope for at the end of the day.&nbsp;
At this time, we should celebrate his life. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family. The world lost a great human being.
Steve you were the true capitalist Da Vinci of our times. May your soul rest in peace!&nbsp;
I know that nothing is going to change with this email, but i wasn't sad as i  am at now even in my grandmother funeral.
Dear friend:     I have been your fan since 80´s, when I first used an Apple II. I have been in a dream of endless innovation and amusement, and I hope there in heaven, you can continue your way, so when I get there Saint Peter welcomes me with his new version of your Ikey.
My thoughts, condolences, and prayers to the friends and family, he lived a great life to help us organize our confusing worlds. I wrote my first college papers on a Macintosh, and I have been hooked on Apple ever since. Praise to your innovation and your way to help me "think differently" in my interactions with the world. Thank you Steve. 
I would like to thank Steve Job for all the amazing work he's done. No   one was able to associate creativity, design, and quality as he did. Steve, you are going to be missed, and your name will stay in the   history. You inspired my generation by giving another vision of the   technology.
Thank you for everything, especially to make the most wonderful cell phone of the world!!
I owe Steve the three most important things in this world. My wonderful life, made healthy again after illness with the support of my amazing Apple coworkers and the benefits we are provided. My beautiful wife, whom I met while we were working at Apple. She's the best thing that has ever happened to me. My perfect daughter, born less than one month ago.    I am forever in your debt, Steve. And I know that I'm not alone.  I know at least four other children here because of what you've helped build.  I know that my talents helped me to be who I am but Steve gave me the tools to help get me there.  I will miss you as though you are family. You will live on long after you have left us because people like me will tell our children about you and what you mean to us.  Thank you for everything.&nbsp;
He will be greatly missed. I will always remember  his excitement in introducing a new piece of Apple technology that  really revolutionized our world. I grew up with Apple and Mr. Jobs. His  presence and spirit will be sorely missed. My condolences and prayers to  his family and loved ones.
So sorry for the loss of Steve as a friend and co-worker there at Apple.  I hope his legacy will inspire future generations of genius.&nbsp;
Since I was a kid, playing on my friend's Apple II, through the Mac Plus that got me through college, to my iPods, iMacs, MacBooks, iPads, every single one of them felt like more than just a piece of cold plastic, metal and glass.  It was the inspiration of Steve and the work of the people he inspired that made all of these cherished possessions.  Thank you Steve, for making the  everyday extraordinary.&nbsp;
I'm sad to learn of Steve Jobs passing. My condolences to his family and friends. The world has lost someone who improved our lives. I am proud to know that the Bay Area, where I was born and live, provided the environment that supported such an innovator.
From this side of the world I say, THANK YOU!  You fill me every day with inspiration, you changed the world and  changed mine too.  Your legacy, your genius mind will be remembered for ever!  Thank you Steve Jobs.
You will be forever in our hearts.  Thank you for all the innovations  you have shared us.  Rest in peace. 
Steve Jobs made my life (and many, many others) better by making technology friendly, useful and reliable.  His legacy will only grow over the years and deservedly so.  Rest in Peace, my friend.&nbsp;
Well, I don't have much to say but, if there is life beyond the existence  we know, I hope you do the same what you did here: follow your heart! Go in peace, bro!&nbsp;
No body can replace him!     A big loss of the World.     The world will not forget him until last day of the world.  RIP STEVE.     Love you. &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank  you!
There will never a another human being on this planet who will put in as  much as Mr. Jobs did for changing the world.
I spent many years as a WebObjects developer and could never quite believe that Apple could make such amazingly cool things even cooler with every new product. His star will always shine bright.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve Jobs for providing humanity with an enviable quality and unique products that have revolutionized our society. The world will remember you as one of the great men of the last century. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.
The world has lost one of its greatest men. A true inspiration and a role model  for not only me but all of us. I hope Apple will live on as you envision it to.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs, a true technological pioneer, will be sorely missed. Our current cell phones and how we use computers in our daily lives are directly influenced by everything he did. It is sad he left us so soon, but his legacy in his company will continue. He is part of history, and will never be forgotten.&nbsp; Rest in peace, Steve.  
Steve was fortunate to be one of the few people who essentially got to see how the world viewed his legacy.  Unlike most people, he didn't have to wait until he passed away, he just had to resign.    My appreciation and admiration has far more to do with his process than it does his products-- and his products are of course game changers.    Thanks Steve. 
I hope you have a nice trip and enjoy your freedom.  Thanks for sharing your genius, passion and perseveration. I am sure the world need leaders that inpire people like you did. We did love your work, but I think, what we loved more, was the passion you printed on it and shared it with us.  I am sure that is what people learned and will remember. Enjoy your trip, freedom and rest in peace.  We love you.
Steve, You created a company that has played a significant role in my life and  my happiness. Your products have given me a creative voice that will  soon be my means to live by. I thank you for all you've given the world.&nbsp;
Even though I did not know you I wanted to thank you for all the great innovations and gifts you gave to all of us. You are a prime example of what the human being is capable of doing.  Rest in peace.
The world has lost another Walt Disney, another dreamer and innovator! &nbsp;He changed technology and the movie industry. &nbsp;What a sad day.
Beyond the incredible products Apple has produced, there is a legacy that if far more incredible.  I can't say I have even met the great man who has left this existence but from what I have know about him (I have read anything there has ever been printed, viewed anything that has ever been filmed and digested everything that I could) about Mr. Jobs.  In Apples products, you feel a connection, almost human at times that I feel he was trying to push towards.  I am deeply saddened by his passing and I wish his family and friends all the blessings and goodwill there are.  There never has been or ever will be someone like him.
Thank you for vision of the future.  Our thoughts are with your family.
This is the first public person who has ever passed away and left me with the level of sadness  I am feeling.  I feel like I lost a great friend and the future of the world will suffer im measurably. His vision that yielded some of the greatest products the consumer markets ever saw, is irreplaceable.  I can only try to imagine the conversation he is having,as I type, with the likes of Thomas Edison, Leonardo DaVinci, and scores of lesser geniuses.  The world was blessed to have him for the too few years he was given. He was  a once in a lifetime person who gave so much.  I am happy he is out of his pain, and hope he rests in peace.&nbsp;
Dearest Apple,  Steve Jobs was my idol since I was little. I'm 12 years old now and I treasure and love Apple Inc. more than most things in my life. When I heard the news of this tragic death, I started crying. My desktop background on my new MacBook is now the picture you have on your website, tributing Steve Jobs. I have also set all statuses to "Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs. I will always love you, you are my idol &lt;3:'(" I am so sorry for your loss, it was the loss of the most amazing person on the face of the earth and I believe Apple will get through this. I give all of my love and support to you. He will always be with you, watching over Apple as a sort of guardian. He will always be present in our hearts. I love you, Apple. I love you, Steve Jobs. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
 To see how he married design to technology with the understanding that it all must "just work" is brilliant. His finger prints are all over every product, every store, probably even the product displays. He truly "got it". An inspiration and a visionary, Steve Jobs was brilliant.  Thanks for making the world a better place Steve.&nbsp;
Dear Steve, his family and friends,  I have so much of my life to owe to Steve and everyone at Apple. I've  grown up alongside the meteoric rise of the company and Steve had so  much to do with that. His contribution to the company has meant a great  deal to me, as your products I use everyday have inspired me into a love  for technology and a wonderment for what is yet to come. I can honestly  say that without Steve, myself and millions of other people wouldn't be  who they are today.  Thank you for everything you've done.  RIP Steve. 
I did not know Steve, but every day I am blessed with his vision. I am a long time Mac fan and I could not think of any other way to live my life and my business. I am grateful for his life, his dream, his unselfishness in sharing such a wealth of knowledge.  What an amazing legacy, thank you.
 You've created the best user experiences ever. The way/style of your presentation was remarkable. I/We will always remember you Steve.
You will be missed. 
You left a better world behind you than you find. You changed your time, you brought us future. You thouched to the  life of millions. They will still be touching the products  you gave them after you. Thank you, Rest in peace. &nbsp;
My condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs. May he rest in peace. He was a great pioneer and visionary and has shaped many of our lives. My thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;
Communication has never been so close to the beautiful. Innovation never managed to be side by side with aesthetics. Only one man managed to treat world with effective originality.  Steve Jobs. The sky is happy with the arrival, while the earth cries for the departure.
I have been using your computers since I was a kid. I started playing with graphics programs when I should have been studying. But now I am a professional artist/animator who gets to play all day. I can't imagine where I would be without your computers. Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
Steve's passion to enrich our world through technology has created jobs, wealth and excitement like no other industry has done since the early 1900s with the invention of the automobile and airplanes.  Hopefully one day soon the energy industry will have a leader of passion for technology and take us to where we have not been before.  Much love, peach and blessings to the Jobs and Apple family.  Press on!
  To his family my best wishes to them at this time, so very sorry for your loss.  Thank you for supporting him while making him the man the world as come to &nbsp;love, and share in that loss with you. Godspeed Steve Jobs.
 Just a big "Thanks" to Steve for getting me 'connected'.  I used 'PC' at  work &amp; never touched a computer after 4:30 pm because it just wasn't  enjoyable.  Since I got my Macbook my world has expanded exponentially.    Add in my iPhone and my world totally rocks! RIP, Steve.  You are irreplaceable.
From all parts of the globe, he has touched us through his products. Though we never knew him personally, he will be missed. We shall look forward to the legacy he leaves behind. More power &amp; success to Apple.
I'm 13 and have always looked up to Steve.  He has changed the world; he  revolutionized the way we all communicate now and changed our lives. It  was sad not seeing him yesterday at the Keynote but now we know why. My  condolences go out to his friends and family and all the people at Apple  that have the chance to be apart of his life. Apple will continue to  grow and succeed.  So simply rest in peace Steve, you were a great man and you will be  missed. 
Even if I never met Steve myself I think of him as a visionary and innovation person. Transformed his own company and ahead of the competition. I remember getting excited for his events and his way of showing the latest gadgets. His one more thing made us wanting more. I know apple will become successful and its brighter days is in the future. Steve's micromanagement and persistent about his job hiding his health condition as he worked in Apple showed Steve's perseverance.  Best Regards Good Bye Steve Jobs He will be missed. 
 Remember the day, remember a dear friend, remember what you lost, but most of all - simply remember.    Not out of grief, but gratitude for him being part of your life.   I know that words cant really do anything to make this feeling of grief go away,  but i really think that keeping the memory alive is to keep him alive in your heart.   My heart goes out to his wife Laurene, his family and to all who feel a great loss.   Thank you Steve, for inspiring so many people who have made the world more interesting.   In deep mourning.
I am still in a shock. I never thought he would be gone so soon. The world will never be the same without him.  RIP.
 Tonight the Earth shines less bright But the Stars have a new shining light From my IIc to my iPad Your products shone the way, for this wandering Nomad Safe Journey to your Soul Steve.   
Thank you Mr. Jobs, for bringing the fabulous ideas and products to our life. May you rest in peace. We'll see you in heaven.
 My condolences to his family and friends. Steve changed the world of IT and pushed all the industry further more. The world will remember!
RIP Mr.Jobs, a great visionary, legend, leader , genius and a wonderful person.  You will be missed&nbsp;
Dear Steven,  I am a big fan of you. You are one of the greatest man in your time! Rest in peace!&nbsp;
Sorry a don't speak english, but I try to make my best effort for a great people that was Steve, for a tribute to a genius, a visionary men that he was.and only remenber a great frase that says:"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." Thank Steve, and good bless you.!!
This was my facebook post and my husband said I should send it to you.   We really are sad for the loss. I am saddened by the loss of a wonderful man who has affected my life  deeply.  Steve Jobs made Apple a household name.  I remember when it was  fighting for its life and Steve came back.  Mac geeks celebrated his  return and I didn't really understand the significance. My husband  always built our computers, but I finally got my first Mac when I was  looking for a small laptop in 2003.   After seeing how well it worked, my husband surrendered and became a Mac user.   He tells people, "I fix pcs all day, I just want to come home to a  computer that works."  Many, many Apple products later and many release  date lines later, we are BIG Apple users.  Steve Jobs is like a part of  the family.  We mourn his death, but rejoice that he is out of pain.   RIP Steve. 
As one apple user, condolences are expressed to Mr.Steve jobs death. It is hoped Mr.Steve jobs intention continues being useful in apple products  from now on.
I'm sadden by the news but am hopeful that his contributions will impact generations to come.
Steve was an inspiring person, creator, and leader. He will forever be remembered. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
My heart goes out to Steve Jobs family. May he rest in peace He was an amazing man and gave people what no other man can ever do and that is hope and faith in themselves thru his creations.  I thank Steve Jobs for giving people like my mother, who is computer illiterate, the ability to connect with the rest of the world thru the iPad. Until the creation of the iPad my mother never would approach anything that had to do with technology because she was afraid to fail. It was too difficult for her to use any kind of computer. Because of his incredible accomplishments and amazing creations, like the iPad. She now uses he iPad on a day to day bases. She learned so much at the age of 59 than she did at the age of 12. My mother never got to finish school past 5th grade but after learning from the iPad my mom has changed her life in how she has improved in reading english and feels more in place around her owns kids to know she isn't left behind. Thank you again Steve Jobs for your amazing ability to change peoples lives.
Thank you Steve for bringing the world together.  Your vision has touched us all and I am deeply grateful for your presence in this world.
Steve Jobs was an amazing visionary and we need more people that are not afraid to takes risks like he did.  Where would we be without him?
I never knew Steve but always admired him from afar.  When the world loses a  genius, it is a sad day indeed.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for changing the way we think, learn, communicate and  enjoy life. You were a true genius and hero! 
Dear Steve,  Thanks for the magic.
 Steve Jobs, es para mi una figura inspiradora, por dar al mundo la posibilidad de conocer y utilizar novedosos y sorprendentes productos, lamento mucho su muerte, uno de mis sueños era conocerlo en persona, lamentablemente ya no se va a poder, el mundo te va a extrañar mucho Steve Jobs, perdemos a un excelente persona, pero ganamos mucho conocimiento y tecnología gracias a ti, y espero que tu logros sigan avanzando como hasta ahora, "vive por siempre Steve Jobs, vive por siempre en Apple".            
Such a brilliant dreamer.  He brought us all so much fun.  Terribly sorry to everyone at Apple and the Jobs family for this loss.  Mr. Jobs left the world a better place.
I write this on an Apple MacBook and just made a call on my iPhone.  There is so little in this new world that has not been touched in some way by the vision of Steve Jobs.  Condolences to Steve's family and we were all so fortunate to have benefitted from his work.  He is always with us.
Thank your for ALL, Steve... You made me happy many, many times in my life... I'll miss you a lot... See you sometime, somewhere... 
 Mr. Jobs was an amazing visionary. I am a big fan of him and we never forget about you. My sincere condolences for the family. We going to miss you in those amazing presentation. You were the best.
I was not supprised, but still shocked when I heard this news - Steve left us.   Steve brought us with wonderful personal electronic products, iMac, iPod, iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, iTunes... which changed our lives and make our lives broader.  It's time to say good bye. Hope Apple continues take us incredible products.
Steve Jobs has made the world a better place. He has made mankind to have a  more meaningful life. By his unrepeatable monumental achievements in the field  of science and arts, he lives forever in our hearts, in the memory of mankind.  He is not a part of us, but in fact we are part of him. There was the age of  Socrates. There was the age of Shakespeare. We modern twenty first  century&nbsp;humans&nbsp;should be very proud to claim that ours is the age of Steve Jobs.  
Thank you Steve for making our dreams come true. You will ALWAYS be remembered.
Dear Friends and Family, I wish to send my sincerest condolences. Steve was a great man, one who  will be remembered forever. His products and his mindset have changed  the world drastically. You are all in my prayers. I wish you nothing but  the best.
To Dear Steve Jobs  this news is kinda shock me, i can't believe and accept it at the first time, however, it is true. i try to use all my  words to describe  how much i respect you. i hope you can hear it from the heaven. i appreciate all the product you create for us, you leads us to a whole new world.  i don't know what the world is going to be without you. but i do believe you have left your spirit in the APPLE. just look so many people feel sad about  your past you will know how many people love you. deep from our hearts.  i hope you will be happy in the heaven and God will be with you.  RIP  I will never forget you!
We will miss you Steve Jobs.  You made Apple into a wonderful experience to us users.  You were a genius and had inspired many.  Thank you for what you have given us. 
I was so surprised and shaken. I just found out a few minutes ago that mankind has lost of it's greatest geniuses. Steve's journey to becoming an electronic guru was the epitome of the American dream. Steve began the Apple Computer Company at the age of 21 in 1976 in his parents' garage. Slowly, he expanded that company year by year, and today, Apple is one of the greatest and most powerful companies in the world. To all patrons and enthusiasts of Apple, raise your iPods, iPads, iMacs, iPhones, and other Apple gadgetry in silent salute, to the man who made them all possible. Steve, your legacy and brilliance will live on your company, and your products forever. 
Just a man, just an ordinary human being, has left.   But this man who just fought for his dreams, building a company, the most valuable company in the world, tought us that everything begins with imagination. Imagining, inventing and re-inventing a new whole world is the clue.  Thanks Steve for teaching the world that dreams are the key of the future.&nbsp;
You are my idol and a person that I could only dream to be like when i  grow up. I look up to you. Your death (in my opinion) is the worst i  have ever heard of. You will always be in our hearts. You are my hero. 
 Como diseñador y persona, me duele mucho la pérdida de un personaje tan influyente en el diseño del siglo XXI.&nbsp;
How I wish I had reached out to you earlier... All of us here want to extend our deepest condolences to the entire Apple family over the loss of Steve Jobs. Not only was Steve a visionary, but someone I've been inspired by -- a virtual mentor, so to speak. Our company launched two years ago and has iPods that are literally powering our business. Thanks to all of you for creating such terrific products that enable even the littlest companies to appear bigger than we actually are. May Steve rest in peace.&nbsp;
A true inspirational leader has changed in our lives in so many ways,  making technology so easy to use, making listening to music so easy to  get, and most of all making me get inspired to be a better person every  single day, because he simply made the world a better place.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve, for everything. I've continuously owned and used your creations since the mid-80s. Using a Mac was always an intuitive process. I will miss your impact on our world's future technological advances, though I trust your spirit will continue to inspire others.
Although I never met Steve Jobs, I always enjoyed reading about how he had created a company as large as Apple from nothing.   I sit here, saddened about this news in a way I never thought possible. I would like to thank Steve Jobs for all the hours he has put into bringing all these amazing products to the wider public and for achieving all that he has throughout his life. Without Steve Jobs, the world would not be what it is today.  My thoughts and prayers go to his family and to the whole of Apple Inc.&nbsp;
Incredible sadness. Imagine what more he had in his imagination!&nbsp;
Steve, THANK YOU!!!!! from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU!!!! Thank  you for teaching me that there are no limits to inspiration, and  teaching me to live beyond set limits and realize there are no  boundaries. In having a dream of how you can affect the world. But most  of all  thank you for teaching me to have the faith to look back and  connect the dots, and learning to trust the future will do it all by  itself. A Leader and a Visionary, a man whom we should all aspire to be  like, you will be missed by many, you will be missed by me, but the  legacy you leave behind, to follow your dreams will live on forever,  inspiring people till the end of time. Rest Well, till we meet again.
This is sad sad day!  I never thought I'll feel like that, but it's overwhelming... tears falling down from my eyes...  Steve you were great man and you'll always be in my mind, I will tell my son about you and want him to be like you! My house is full with Apple stuff only because of excellence of those products and I believe that's because literally you were behind all of that to the last screw! Apple will go on! Miss you a Lot! Rest in peace, Steve!&nbsp;
Wish I may express my sincere appreciation for his brilliant  contributions.   Wish I may express my sincere condolences to his  friends and family.  Wish I might thank him!
The world has lost a true visionary. My condolences to the Jobs family.  You truly will be missed.
An innovator who inspired generations with his vision and passion. A revolutionist who created a lifestyle, a culture which interacted with modern technology and changed the way we live and the way we communicate. He left an extraordinary company behind that enriched and improved the quality our lives. Thank you very much Steve Jobs for being one of the most inspirational figures of last centuries. Rest in Peace&nbsp;
I completely and wholeheartedly agree that Steve Jobs was an amazing man  who completely revolutionized technology. His death was a big blow to  both the industry and world as a whole, but he won't be forgotten.&nbsp;
Hi.  We have lost the greatest visionary of the modern era, and there will  never be another one like him.  All I can say is thank you, Steve.   Thank you for the great memories and for making my life easier with the  Apple products you made possible that I use.  We will miss you a lot,  and I say "we" because I feel that I am a part of Apple.  We must  continue with his vision and his legacy cannot be forgotten.  My deepest condolences to his family,  his friends, and the Company.
Steve Jobs.  You are the GREATEST!&nbsp;
A wonderful presenter and a wonderful person. He held on to see the iPhone 4 S. Only Steve would do that. Sending this from my iPad.20  My heart goes out to his family which includes his Apple co-workers.
I never met Steve Jobs. And i wouldn't have to had my life changed by   him. Like me, thousands had the same luck, in a time where our lives are   bombed with bad news, tragedy, wars...where the people most talked   about are Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, etc...or the topics are   wars, economic crisis, pollution... Steve brought to us not just joy, color, design... he brought   integration, technology, information, put people together even they   are thousands miles away. He made the word impossible something out of his life, and we should   all learn from him. The world lost a great man, a great revolutionary, a great leader.  Godspeed Steve, and we all mac lovers see you soon. Thanks you very   much.&nbsp;
Our heart goes out to the "apple family." Most of us will never have known him. Every time we saw him with next best apple creation we were captured by his excitement. The torch as been past but we will miss his spirit.
Steve,  You will live on. You are Apple. Apple is Steve Jobs. While you will physically be gone, you will never be truly gone. Rest in peace. Hopefully they setup an Airport base station so you can get WiFi access.  Thanks for everything.&nbsp;
I've never owned one. Nor&nbsp;have I&nbsp;owned&nbsp;an iPod or an iPhone. But I can say without reservation that Steve Jobs was a pioneer who started a company with a vision and rescued that company at one its most vulnerable time and raised it to one of the greatest most revered technical giants of the 20th and 21st century. I have the upmost respect for the man. He was what is best about America. The fact that you can start with little and endeavored to create something beyond your dream. &nbsp; Thank you.
Mr. Jobs. Steve, if I may be so bold.  I might list all the ways your innovation and that of the employees of Apple affect my life each day, however I will spare the dissertation and simply say thank you.  Thank you and you will not be forgotten.  To your family my condolences and again you have my thanks.&nbsp;
I don't think anyone will ever be able to fathom the true impact he had not &nbsp;only on modern technology but on society as a whole. He proved that you don't  have to be the top of your college graduating class to accomplish something  and have a great impact on the world. All you need is an idea.
Steve Jobs had a drive to innovate and make great things because that's how geniuses tick. What set him apart was his commitment to bringing his innovations to everyone, because that's who great things should be for.  When I wake up in the morning, one of the first things I see is his quote: "Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me ... Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful... that's what matters to me." Since I began applying that philosophy to everything I do - professionally, personally - I've found things tend to work out ok.  Thanks, Steve. Thanks for giving me great technologies to use, and even better wisdom to follow and share.
  You change my life Steve, Thank you Thank you Thank you.  I have no doubt you are already streamlining Heaven as you did on Earth.  Farewell.&nbsp;
  World has lost the greatest visionary!!!! You are inspiration to us and our kids! 
A very sad day and great loss indeed!!     I have been a lecturer/teacher in interactive multimedia for many years. Using Macintosh computing devices in many forms, his vision and extra insight into many fields related to this technology would be shoes hard to fill.  My deepest condolences to his family and close friends.  Rest in peace Steve!
Gracias, Steve.  
Steve Jobs, I think more than anyone else, personified the American spirit. He rose from humble beginnings to become one of the greatest success stories in the history of business.  His pursuit of bold innovation drove him to break boundaries and create technological marvels that were truely 'magical'.  Steve was a man who knew what he wanted, and even in the face of death itself, he continued to push technology to make the world a better place for us all.  He will forever be remembered in our hearts and minds as an American Icon...
I was really shocked as well as saddened when I saw the news...I believe  that Steve Jobs was the best inventor and CEO in history. I would just  like to offer my condolences and sorrow to his family and to Apple. I  really, really hope that Apple keeps the edge and innovation that Jobs  introduced.
Much will be said about Steve Job's contributions that have touched all  of us - Macs; iPods; iPhones; iPads.  To my mind probably the most  important legacy of Steve Jobs (and Apple) is his contribution to  education.  From grade school to university Apple represents the best  marriage of technology and learning.  As an educator and scholar, I am  indebted to Steve Jobs for helping to create tools that have enlivened  my classes and strengthened my research.  His genius will continue to  touch us all.&nbsp;
We are very sorry to hear that Steve Jobs left us. He was one example for our world, and for humanity, unforgetable, in all senses. Please tell his friends how sorry we feel.
Your contributions shaped the modern world. Your generosity was a model of ideal CEO behavior. You were and are an American Icon whose contributions to our society will be felt for eons. You were a brilliant mind and a symbol of the 21st century. My sympathies to all those you left behind personally and at the company you shaped. You will be truly missed. I pray that you have found peace. 
I was a fan of Apple before it was cool. From my first MacII CX I was   hooked on Apple. As a graphic designer and owner of a small commercial   printing company I have experienced the magic first hand. From the   earliest days of running primitive Pagemaker I would have nothing but   Macs. I am so glad Steve was around to grow the company to the   powerhouse it is today.  My condolences to his family and friends. He will be missed.&nbsp;
It was an honor to work for your company. I was proud to recruit for your Apple, Retail Stores and spread the word of apple across Canada and Milano, Italy.  You enriched my life.&nbsp;
 Although we knew that this time would come, I never thought that  I would actually feel this distraught about Steve Jobs passing. He will  always be remembered as a visionary, a creative genius in the  technological world. For this generation, the death of Steve Jobs can  only be equated to the death of John F. Kennedy or Princess Diana. Steve  Jobs has one way or another touched each and everyone of us in the  world. He will always be remembered in our life time and for life times  to come through the Apple name. Its deeply saddening that we have lost  such an iconic legend, my thoughts and prayers go to his family.
Not sure I have ever felt this deep of a sadness for an individual I had never met. I can only surmise that it stems from what I became (an Art Director) due in part to my trusted Macs through the years. From the first Mac in our house in 1984 to this day I have never worked on anything but an Apple computer. My deepest condolences to his family and the Apple community.&nbsp;
Steve changed the world in so many ways.  As I compose this message on my iPad, I can only imagine the innovation, vision and leadership the world lost today.  RIP Steve.  The world will always remember you.
You were a great inspiration for so me and so many others. You are already so greatly missed. Thank you again. God bless you. &nbsp;
Dear steve,  Thank you very much for creating the revolutionary I phone and I pad. These two products have created a positive impact in my educational and daily life. I will remember you as the man who revolutionized the Post PC era.  
You will be remembered.  Like the person who invented books, you have propelled the human race to the next level of cognitive evolution, by simplifying the process of storing and retrieving information.  And you did it with style.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs is definately an amazing human being, that has contributed greatly in the modern technology. And, everytime I use my ipad, I will think of you.            
A great person is gone, a person that was the head of a way of being is gone. Apple has changed the way I view PC's, its OS has made me think that a perfect thing is possible, I love it. Steve with all the Apple staff changed the world, you guys even have an episode in The Simpsons.  I want to express my condolences for the loss of a great person and hope its legacy and actions keep in our minds for a long time.  Thanks for everything! And Condolences from Colombia.&nbsp;
No te conocí, pero marcaste mi vida y lo que soy ahora.  Tuve la suerte de tener la primera mac que llegó a Quito, Ecuador.  Y con ella la posibilidad de hacerme lo que soy ahora.  Estudié diseño gráfico en mucho por lo que mi Mac me permitió desarrollar, fuimos junto con mi familia pioneros y luchadores en contra de todos los PCeros, como les decíamos... en las buenas y en las malas siempre estuvimos con Apple, y lo primero que hacíamos cuando comprábamos un carro, (como lo acabo de hacer hace unas semanas) es poner mi sticker de Apple en mi carro, antes de nada... eso me marca y me marcará siempre...  Gracias por todo!!! sin saber que existo, me ayudaste en hacer mi vida y lo que seré siempre  De corazón, que descanses en paz, y todo nuestro respecto y cariño para su familia.&nbsp;
Such a sad day! Steve was a brilliant man. My thoughts and prayers go  out to all his family and friends. I did not know him personally, just  am a fan of his creations. 
To the Jobs family,  I write on one of Steve's inventions.&nbsp;    I hope that Steve and your family were able to enjoy his last days in a peaceful and private place.&nbsp; He was truly a visionary and someone who pursued what he loved.&nbsp; He made a true impact on our society.  My thoughts are with you and your family. 
It takes an amazing visionary to create something from nothing, leave it behind and then breath life into it a second time. Jobs created much more than Apple computers - he created a way of interacting with a machine and made it feel like it was an extension of your hand and mind. Apple will be hard pressed to find that kind of vision again and I only hope (and I feel hopeful that) the company can pool it's collective consciousness and continue what Jobs started.   
 From the 12 year old who had his first contact with a Macintosh and  knew the world would change, too the 27 year old that has seen it happen.  I promises I will keep my passion to make sure it does.  In Loving memory.
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple computers in a time of great  innovation. Steve Jobs was a visionary with the future in sight. He was a man of the  Apple. Simplicity and Complexity in one. May he be known and never forgotten.
 The world is immeasurably better because of Steve.&nbsp;
Dear all,  I would like to express my deepest condolences on Steve Jobs' passing   away...I am devastated, his genius and his products made my life a lot   happier and a lot easier.  When I first saw a Mac in 1997, I fell in love at once with the   product, the concept, the company...and I was never the same again. I   am a grown up man today, but deep in my heart still that fascinated   youngster every time I turn on my Mac.  Rest in peace, dear Steve. We owe you too much.&nbsp;
Just one word "BEST", thank you Mr. Jobs...
You changed our way of seeing the world Steve, bon voyage... :) 
I have only been using your products for a decade. But you have been  innovating genius for three. You're a pioneer and a visionary, and you  will be missed by billions. 
It is terribly sad that the world has lost an amazing man, and Apple has  lost its creative genius. It is immeasurably sad for his family to have  lost him at such a young age. My condolences to his wife Laurene and his  four children, who have lost a husband and a father.&nbsp;
R.I.P. Steve. You've changed an industry, and revolutionized a business. Thank you for your contributions to the human race.
 I remember when I was 8 and I had my first computer back in 1980. Steve Jobs  was already present in my life ever since back then. I will miss you Steve,  thank you for teaching us that being fearless and to believe in your ideas pays off in many levels. Thank you for showing us there's always a different angle to things, thank you for teaching us to be unique...  A star is moving on to the next level, the next creative realm.  My sincere condolences Jobs family from my costarican family to yours.&nbsp;
I have admired Steve Jobs and considered him to be an inspiration to me ever since I've known him.  I wished I could have worked alongside of him.  Very sad to hear of his death.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his family. 
I work at Apple. My thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and our Apple family! If it wasn't for Steve, I wouldn't be where I am today, in a job that I love, with a big family who I love to see every day! So Steve thank you for more than just your creative inspirations, thank you for my family!
 Well, five minutes ago I was noticed about this tragedy, I'm so sorry about this, let me tell you this is the worst new I've got this day, Steve was, is, will continue being my idol, I learnt a lot with his ideals, and I trust in him. I knew the moment was coming but I didn't think It would be sooner I thought.  I repeat it again, I'm so sorry, and you, Steve, will be an idol and Hero to me.            
 Thank you Steve, thanks to you I still believe - and will always believe - one can still be a visionary, never give up.
I don't know him, but I Lost him very much. 
 Dear Steve's family,                 R.I.P to the death of Steve Jobs.                 I am a girl from China and study in Purdue University right now. I was using Apple products when I was in junior high. You have no idea how much i love them ever since. After using first Ipod nano, I start to collect them for example, I got shuffle, Ipad, new version of nano, classic, Iphone, mac air and even my whole family are using Iphone. Also I am planning on buying Iphone 4s on 14th of October. I know that Steve's death would bring sorrow even shadows into your family but I really hope your family can get through this. You should know there are zillions of people love Apple.                  Just so you know, Steve has been my role model for years and he will always be. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
He was truly an incredible mind,  innovator and person. He left us too soon, yet managed to leave us with so much. My condolences to his family and friends. Rest in peace Steve.
To the Apple Family,  May I extend my heartfelt sympathies to all at Apple on learning of   the passing of Steve Jobs.
A Titan has moved on.
Thank you for being the greatest innovator in American history. You literally changed the culture of this generation. Our thoughts are with your family and team. "A friend is someone who knows the song in your heart, and can sing it back to you when you have forgotten the words." &nbsp;~Donna Roberts    
To the Families  (personal, work, industry and the world) of Steve Jobs.  Thanks for reaching beyond the established limits and believing in the Possible. You proved that there are no limits  to the imagination. "Dreaming" is what you left as a legacy. We need more people with your courage and passion.   Thanks for being YOU.  God Bless your family and friends.
I never met you, but I knew you.  I never worked for apple, but I sold your product.  Your vision and focus were inspiring.  Your courage, incredibly admirable.  Thank you for your influence and example.  Though you will be missed, you will never be forgotten.  Rest in peace brother.
I am so sorry. You have done so many great things for the world.  
Thank you for all you have given us. You will be missed.
Thank you Steve Jobs for everything you did and for simply changing the world with your amazing vision. You are a true example of how things in life are  possible with motivation, dedication, ambition, and heart. My condolences go out to your family. It has been an honor being part of your generation and your many history changes. My prayers go out to the Jobs family. Thank you!&nbsp;
The world and I will miss him terribly. A one of a kind. My thoughts and prayers are with him and his family and friends. We will miss you Mr. Jobs, I will miss you.
I'm greatly saddened by the news of Steve Jobs's death, my heartfelt condolences to his family. Apple products have changed my life for the better and for that I have Steve to thank. They made me feel like the future had arrived and I was in it. 
Truly saddened by the news.  He was truly a gifted person and he will be  missed.  Thank you Steve, for all your dreams.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to the Jobs family. The world has lost one of the greatest visionaries and creative geniuses of our time. Your legacy will live on forever.
My heart goes out to the entire Jobs family and all of Apple. He was such a great inspiration to so many and even though I didn't personally know him, it  feels like I lost my friend. I can barely even type this message without tears falling down my face. May God watch over his family and comfort them in this time of need. He was certainly way to young but maybe God needed help with his iPad...  RIP Steve Jobs, you will be missed!!!!&nbsp;
The world has lost a visionary, a man we can liken to some of the most inventive men the world has ever seen. I am not sure we will ever see a man of his caliber again.
 Steve is one of the few people that you can say made a real impact on both the IT industry and society as a whole.  His vision and leadership will be dearly missed throughout the world.&nbsp;
My heart goes out to steve. I am really just a person who became very happy when I got a mac, an excellent computer that steve helped engineer. Because of that, he has really changed my life, and I nearly felt like crying when I heard the news that he had died. I am very, very, sad that he has passed away.&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened to hear the news of Steve's passing..  I purchased my first Mac computer this morning and was excited about my purchase all day.  Thanks Steve for building a company that has quality and service that is second to none!! You will be missed greatly!!
Dear Apple,  Steve is my role model for years, and I... I really can't say anything. &nbsp;I'm a huge fan of Steve Jobs and Apple too. I was preparing to go to bed, and in the bed I saw this horrible news. I don't have much money but in the last year I collected enough money to buy the iPhone 4. I was really proud (and I'm still so proud) to have my first iPhone which was presented by the big Steve Jobs who is my idol for long time. Steve made me think different. Yes. It's true. He proved that the precise details are also very, very important in life. He had the ability to make magic in computer science and in people's life too. He will be mourned by millions of people with me. I'm sure. I'm so sad now...  Thank You, Steve Jobs. Rest in Peace. 
Hello, I didn't fully know Steve until around the release of the 4th Gen iPod Nano. I watched the keynote and instantley I said this guy really know what he's doing and later on he became my hero. I continue to watch all the Keynotes. I will miss Steve deeply and no matter what his legacy will live on forever and ever. My heart goes out to his family. MY HERO IS DEAD!! :(&nbsp;
Thank you for the amazing products! Rest in Peace 
Steve wasn't only the most creative CEO the world always had: he was   also a symbol of strengh, inteliggence and hope. We'll trully miss   Steve here, but at least im happy to know that he could see Iphone 4S   be launched, cause we know how important it was to him. Even sick, he   worked cause he knew how important it was to us, and we thank he   sooooo much.&nbsp;
Steve was the reason I was introduced to Apple at such a young age. From my first Apple computer playing Oregon Trail, to my iPhone 4, iMac, and iPad, his revolutionary ideas inspired so many generations. He will be greatly missed. 
Thanks Steve for your Visionary. Ignited minds of younger generation to carry forward your vision to next level.  You always is my true inspiration in IT field. Proven time and again that anything and everything can be accomplished.  May your soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
I remember the first time I got an iPod. I fell in love on the spot. Who knew a simple music player could be so much more than just that? It became a part of me that I carried everywhere.&nbsp;  The day that I got my first iPhone was one of the happiest days of my life. It instantly transformed into an extension of my own arm. I did't leave the house without it. I used it for anything and everything.&nbsp;  When I started to watch the Apple Keynotes presented by Steve Jobs, I was entranced. I believed what he was telling me about and wanted to have the product he was describing. He made Apple cool.&nbsp;  To this day I respect Steve Jobs' diligence and faithfulness towards Apple, even unto his dying breath. He has revolutionized the way I think about technology. He raised the bar and set a standard that no one could match but Apple itself. He made Apple what it is today. Steve Jobs is Apple.&nbsp;  He will forever be remembered as the greatest innovator in the world of technology. Thank you, Steve. You succeeded in doing the impossible: making your products extremely simple and beautiful, and with that, you have moved mountains.&nbsp;
For a long time I have always been and still am a PC person. Not once  though have I felt the satisfaction and tranquility from an easy,  practical, convenient, outstanding, revolutionary and remarkable user  interface as Apple has brought into my technological existence and I am  truly grateful and proud to be an Apple user and what your dreams and  hopes has brought to all us in unification from what you loved. Thank  you and you will be truly missed.
Thanks Steve for changing our lives, God bless you.   
Steve Jobs began innovating this world so young because he was destined  to leave it so early. Nonetheless, his 56 years delivered more impact  than most would in 156.&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs,  You not only inspired me, but became that ONE person whom I'd love to  be. I have never felt the way I do right now, and although I have never  met, heard, spoke, or saw a glimpse of you in real life, you are a man I  will honour. I man that redefined the world of creativity, made a place  in the hearts of many without even trying.
Incredible sadness. Imagine what more he had in his imagination!&nbsp;
I truly don't know of any other entrepreneur who has made a legacy purely through acts of creation. Perhaps Steve Jobs was more Artist than Businessman.  And anyone who's had the fortune to live in the time of a great artist is surely privileged.  May peace be with Steve on his iCloud in the sky.
 My deepest condolences to his family. I'm sending all the love and light they need to go through this difficult time.            
The world has lost one of history's greatest innovators. His absence from the technology landscape will be felt for years to come.
To everyone mourning the passing of Steve Jobs, please be comforted in  the faith inspired truth that all good things are eternal.  So, somewhere in heaven a group of especially talented souls are being  spurred on by a fiery new entity to keep on being insanely great, and  surely all creation will benefit.  Thank you, Steve, for what you did for this world and for what you're  most likely doing for the next.&nbsp;
I remember the first time I worked with a Mac, it was 93 I believe and  it was an all green screen with huge floppy disks. At the time it was a  learning aid for school, thats when I was 6. Now I'm 24 and in college  and I use a Mac book pro for schooling. I had no idea the impact Steve  Jobs and the Apple Corp would have on my education and future. I don't  now if thank you is sufficient enough - but, Thank You. Thank you Steve  for vesting your talents into technology that would improve education in  another life. Your influence, talents, and generosity will be greatly  missed. The world lost a gifted individual today.
You were, and will always be, my hero.  May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,You brought magic to the World and everything has changed from you. Even though you are not here, you still will be with us. We will always remember you and your spirit. &nbsp; Thank you. &nbsp; Rest in peace. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Dear Steve: I'm going to miss you a lot. I'm just a teenage girl in high school right now, but trust me when I say that you've changed my life without even knowing it. Because of you, I've had the courage to defy my family and tell them that I'm going to make a career out of animation, even though that's not the "practical route" they've wanted me to take. Through your struggles and success, I want to try so much harder to overcome my own hardships, and I promise one day, because of your influence on me, that I will be successful. You were a great man.
Ladies and Gents at Apple,  Please accept my humble condolences for the loss of a great thinker,  leader, and a really beautiful mind. Sorry for these bad news. May God  be with his family in these harsh and severe moments. 
 Without any doubt, Steve is my role model. He changed the world and this whole generation. We will miss him forever. Sincerely      A big fan from China.              
We will miss you, thank you for everthing you give us.  You change the world and my life.  Thank you.
Thanks, not because all the technology you bring, thanks for your  modesty, thanks for your speeches, thanks for be an inspiration and i  hope you'll find happiness and peace on the other side.  Again thanks!
 I can't believe! I can't believe!  We have lost the genius of the genius!  Going well, Mr. Jobs. Good luck, apple!
When I think about the potential each of us can bring to life, I think of people like Steve Jobs. He enriched so many of our lives by following his passion and making it perfect. Thank you Steve.
I am very saddened by the loss of such an elevated human being...  Thank you, Steve for your amazing contribution to our world. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
We thank God for having him with us, he shone like a sun among us, earth lost a great human, but heaven won a soul inspiration.
My father died of the same cancer Steve Jobs had in 2010. He was diagnosed in 2006, three years after Steve Jobs. Seeing him lose his battle today is very sad for me, as it hits very close to home. My thoughts are with his family. I know how great your loss is and how heavy your heart is tonight. I am so very sorry.
One of the worlds most innovative and creative minds has left us. Steve Jobs was an inspiration to many and personally inspired me to “Think Different”. I am very thankful that I was fortunate enough to meet him in person. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and the team at Apple.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs,  The world has cried for The loss of a unique genius, thank you for everything you provided to all. I was fortunate to live to see the evolution of technology through your vision and developed ideas.
Our family thanks you for having the courage to take so many wonderful  risks, resulting in a more magical world for all of us.
This is a sad day for the world.  My sympathies to his family and all  his colleagues at Apple.  He was much too young to die; especially such  a brilliant man.  My thoughts are with you.&nbsp;
 Thanks Steve.  You made easy  what people had thought to see difficult.  You made lovely what people had been used to see ugly.  You made colorful what people had been forced to believe dark and monotonous.   You made light what people had carried heavy.  We love you, Steve.  Enjoy watching us on the cloud! &nbsp;&nbsp;
You were and will continue to be an inspiration and hero to me.  I will tell my children about you and your accomplishments.  Thank you for all the amazing products.     You were insanely great.&nbsp;
I met Steve Jobs at the Palo Alto Apple store opening.  Was maybe the coolest moments in my life.  Steve was not only a visionary but he really listened to his customers.  I will miss Steve's One More Thing keynote speeches, and not to mention his signature turtle neck and jeans.
Steve truly perfected the link between man and machine through pure inspiration and creativity. My prayers are with his family and friends. Rest in peace Steve.
 Peace be with you on your next journey Mr. Jobs.   You have given so much to so many.  We are grateful for all the innovations you have given us, and those yet to come thanks to your insight and spirit.  We mourn with Laurene and your children, and we mourn with your family at Apple.  Thank you Steve.   
He made the world more beautiful. It isn't just that he understood the actual product should be beautiful, but he understood that what it made possible should be beautiful as well. He made the act of creating on computers a thing of beauty and the participation in beauty itself. The world is a more beautiful place because of him. Thank you, Steve, for being true to yourself and helping us find ourselves as well.
"When you were born, you cried and the world rejoiced. Live your life in a manner. So that when you die, the world cries and you rejoice."  I think you've made it and you've made it so good for this whole world. We all here will pray and always remember The Best Genius we've ever known, Mr. Jobs.  God with you.
I am 19 years old, I'm from Colombia and I've been following Apple for a long time. I have to say that the world have lost one the greatest minds that it ever had, it's not only the products he helped to create but his enthusiasm. I send my condolences to his family and friends, and that the world will always remember who he was and what he did for the world.
My condolences to the Jobs family.  The world lost a truly great   person today.  We will miss you Steve.     
Steve was innovative, a brilliant mind that innovated the world. I am an admirer of the life history Steve Jobs. Today we are saddened by his death, but he will live forever in our hearts.
In 1984 I was a senior in high school and my father brought home a 128k  Mac. I could use a computer. I've been using Steve's products for the  last  27 years. Each and every one of them changed how I looked at  things. I always describe to friends my feelings about Apple's products  that using them is fun. Using PC's was working, using Macs was like  playing they were just fun. Steve Jobs changed my profession, he made it  easier. That's what he has always done. Thank you Mr. Jobs. You have  enriched my life and that of my family.
  What a terrible loss, so young, thank you Steven Jobs for all you have given and the way you have changed everyday life. My sincere condolences and prayers to his family.
You inspired so many people Steve. You will surely be missed. &nbsp;
You will be missed Steve. The world has lost a great person today. RIP Steve.
...Just wanted to write something.  ...I receive inspiration from a lot of sources, one of them is the work of people like Steve Jobs.  ...I'm an illustrator, every day is a constant search for images that amaze people, that touch people, you guys do that, Steve still does that.  ...Thanks a lot for the tools and for the example, for the inspiration, that's a thing that doesn't die.  ...My condolences to the family, friends and co-workers.
Thank you Steve for being an inspiration and model.  Thank you for showing the world what computers and technology are capable of in our lives.  And most of all, thank you for showing us what a person is capable of when following his dreams and relentlessly saying no to the walls placed around him.
I can say with all honesty that I would be doing NOTHING that I do today, with the ability I have to do it, with the human passion that it encourages, without the vision of Steve Jobs. I am at a loss beyond comprehension.
Steve you have brought so many new and amazing ideas to apple. You were  clearly a genius. I admire you and how you became so wealthy and  successful. You were one of a kind and will truly be missed.&nbsp;
We lost an icon who teached us to think about icons. 
I'm very pleased to have shared a dinner with Steve way back in the  80's. He leaves behind an enormous legacy - I'm not sure that people  fully appreciate how things were in a particular market before Steve  jumped in with another 'insanely great' product.  I'm really very sad that this has happened to him.
Steve, you are without question the greatest visionary of our lifetime. Thank you so much for changing the planet.
This company and his legacy will shine a little brighter knowing that Steve will be watching over it in Heaven.  My prayers and thoughts go to his wife and kids.....those that knew him when  he doubted himself and loved him no matter what....
You were an incredible visionary with a common goal that captivated and sculpted the entrepreneurial minds of generations. Steve work will never be forgotten.
Steve Jobs changed the world.  He brought so many new things to the table.  He changed the way we do our daily tasks.  We have truly lost one of the greatest innovators of all time.  I am honored to have lived in the same time he did.  He will be remembered forever.  May his family find peace and my God take care of them.  See you on the other side Steve.
I work with special needs children, many of whom have &nbsp;communication &nbsp;disorders. &nbsp;The recent innovations of the iPod touch and iPad and their easy accessibility as a tool &nbsp;have given &nbsp;these children &nbsp;a voice. Thank you Mr Jobs. May your family take comfort &nbsp;in how much you gave to this world.
There are no words to express what the world has lost.  Deepest sympathies to his family who have lost even more.  
I think Steve Jobs was an amazing human being! A real entrepeneur! My condolences to your family and closely friends!  Thanks a lot to you Mr Jobs and your contribution for a better world to  live. You will be with us forever! Love apple! Love your ideas and vision of  future!   
The world has lost one of the greats, thanks for all the excitement and joys that you brought to our lives. God Bless you my Hero.&nbsp;
I remember watching Steve Jobs make a presentation to the Cupertino City Council.  I watched it on youtube.  He was presenting his vision for the new Apple headquarters.  I was most struck by how humble he was, just standing there by himself waiting for his turn to speak, seeming perhaps a little bit nervous or awkward.  Here was the man who had built the largest company in the world and placed the headquarters in his hometown of Cupertino, now waiting for his turn at the lectern to make a pitch for the new Apple headquarters. He described how he had grown up in the city.  He described how the company had outgrown it's facilities, forcing it to lease space scattered throughout the city.  This was his hometown.  He explained how he wanted to bring the company back together into a single, futuristic-looking building. He spoke quietly, unhurriedly, mostly monotone, but with extreme clarity, precision and passion about the vision he had for Apple. It was beautiful. 
Thanks Steve for helping us all find our creative side and challenging us to  think outside the box. You will be deeply missed.&nbsp;
To the Family,  My family and I became Apple converts just this year.  I began learning more about Steve and have so much respect for all that he did to promote the best invention I will ever know.  Our condolences to your family during this time of loss.&nbsp;
Apple, via Steve Jobs, has permeated my life, personal and professional ever since I first laid hands and eyes on a computer.  Thank you Steve for giving the world (and me) a better way forward for digital life.
Steve Jobs made the computer age simple for people like me.  I am a true Apple fan and it is because of him and his vision that I can navigate my computer more easily and have it incorporated more effectively into my every day life.  I thank him.  A Great Visionary.  When we look back in history I truly believe he will be compared to the likes of Louis Pastuer,  Thomas Eddison,  Alex Graham Bell (All men who made life easier for the common person).   My condolescences to his family.   I can't imagine your  loss but your heart must swell with pride that he will live on forever.&nbsp;
First time I knew about Mac was back to 2002. I am from Viet Nam, and extraordinary design and beauty of Mac OS caught my attention from a first look. You have brought your visionary ideas, which at first, people thought lousy products but now billion of people will talk about it as a beacon of glamour, magnificence, standard of technology elegance. I am also learnt a lots from your address at Stanford University Commencement with the lessons that you shared with us from the pivotal moment in your life, from your battle with a severe sickness. These lessons encourage me to move forward, grasp the chances and live with my all youthful strength, so I will not regret.  I am also want to send my sincere, deepest sympathy to his family in this mournful moment. His love for family and children will be always by your side.  I am borrowing one quote from Walt Disney: “Around here, however, we don’t look backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things… and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.” Your mark in history of mankind will last forever.&nbsp;
Thanks for the iPod Steve, my heart goes out to the jobs family.  Nothing harder than losing someone too young.&nbsp;
Dreaming was just the beginning....may your spirit live on in all of us.
Not only Apple, whole world has lost great innovator and genius of modern day.  May his soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
 Mr Steve Job is a real super hero in my heart...i will remember him forever... rest in peace..            
I remember as an artist going to college and discovering Macs and how they were going to revolutionize graphic design.  I received my first Mac as a gift but the real power came when the redesign of Macs were introduced.  I bought the first iMac with the swivel top and an iPod as well.  I have not looked back since.  Knowing how much Steve Jobs had a hand in this technology is humbling and inspiring all at the same time.  Thank you Steve for giving the &nbsp;world so much of your mind and it is that much sadder that you are not here to give more.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve the company you co founded was unbelievable. My condolences go out to all of Steve's family and friends. You will be missed by everyone&nbsp;
Dear Steve, &nbsp; you left us. Every time I saw your pictures or listened to your speeches something like a light created in me. We lost you. Thank god for creating Apple. I will miss you for sure. Thank you Steve, for all those hard days you did not give up, for all those moment you ignored but did not stop and all faith you had about yourself. You changed our world, our imaginary and our stories which we can tell to our kids. Thanks for Toy Story and wonderful moments you gifted us. I do not know how long, but it will take so long to somebody else come to world like you. Rest In peace and remember us.&nbsp;
His Spirit lives forever. The world will always, always, thank &amp; remember  him.  Condolences to Laurene &amp; his four children, and all Apple’s employees.
Steve, you were an inspiration to us and you provided us with a glimpse of what the future holds for humankind technologically. Thank you very much and may you now rest in peace. &nbsp;
No, of course I wasn't lucky enough to have known him personally, but I do remember sitting near him in a restaurant in Assen at the Aspen Design Conference in the 1980s. At that conference a fellow designer I was speaking with remarked how they just came out with computers that can do your mechanicals for you.....No more pasting up on art boards one's design to be printed.  ....and the rest is history.&nbsp;
This world is a better place because of Mr. Steve Jobs. His   innovations are forever going to be the basis of all technological   breakthroughs. My deepest condolence to family and friends. 
What made Steve Jobs special, I believe, was his optimistic view of life and his vision of what his company could achieve to make a positive contribution to the world and the lives of others.  He did this by bringing out the best in himself and those around him, rather than seeking to impede the progress of others.  May his positive view and energies continue on to inspire the world and the next generation of entrepreneurs.
I'm so sad.. I hope your happy where you are now.  Thanks for all mister Jobs.   Rest in peace. &nbsp;
I would like to thank you apple and of course steve jobs for helping me with my music that I can create and share with your products without my first ipod I don't think I would of done anything with music and expressing my passion and struggles thru my MacBook, iPhone, and iPad thank you so much steve... One of the most influential and amazing people in the world&nbsp;
There aren't words to express how much Steve influenced my day-to-day  endeavors or how much the will be missed.&nbsp;
What a great loss to the world, what a great man. The family of Steve Jobs is in my thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;
I have only worked for Apple for one year, but everyday I am blown away  by this company. Steve has done so much for this world..and so much for  me. It's not just about the amazing technology, but this new Family that  I have. "Thank You" dosen't seem to say enough but right now its all I  have.  Thank You!  We'll miss you every day
A great mind, a great inspiration! His work will live on - on our   desks, in our seminar rooms and lecture halls!&nbsp;
Steve's work helped shape the modern computing world. I feel that, without him, we would not recognize the devices in front of us as computers; we would recognize them as calculators, and we, as a race, would of lost a very powerful tool.  Rest in peace, Steve; your work, both in and outside of Apple, has helped so many.   
Mr. Jobs:  Having grown up with Apple products, I remember being so excited to use  a Macintosh computer for the first time. The vision was so special and  everyone knew it - even then.   You truly brought, and continue to bring  as your legacy, such joy to everyone, including industries of artists!  Your reach is far, limitless and unquantifiable.  You actually changed  entire industries - not just the computer industry itself.   You are a  testament to possibilities.  Thank you for living your gifts!! &nbsp;
The first thing I can think of is his legacy, not only for the great organization he founded and lead, but for human kind. Its History and its future. Yes, that deep. He took us all beyond our down to earth expectations, developing artifacts that came from dreams and images of the future. He took us to the 21st century. No keys to type. No mouses to grab and move. Just our bare hands.  Thank you. 
Steve Jobs was the greatest innovator of our time. The legacy he is leaving behind his going to be a large hill to climb. Our prayers go out to his family and loved ones.&nbsp;
I'm a graduate student in design and musicology  field. I grew up with Macintosh, and i learned a lot from the products and the  company, and there is no doubt that i cultivated an aesthetic cense from them. so I just want to say thank you to all who work for Apple, and  especially Mr. Jobs for releasing so many of amazing products.  RIP Mr.Jobs.&nbsp;
I was sad to hear about Mr. Jobs passing.  Steve Jobs was a modern day  Walt Disney.  Even though I never met the man or had the pleasure of  working with him at Apple his personality, and zest of creativity would  always show during his keynotes. Myself and my parents now use Apple products because of Mr. Jobs.  I  have inspired others to purchase Apple products because how it made my  life easier and fun.  Please give my best to his family, both at Apple and in his private  life.  I only hope that his vision will continue to inspire the next  generation of technology.
R.I.P Steve Jobs you where amazing for all the products you released. From starting with the iPod all the way to the iPhone 4gs. You were amazing to the world and Apple will never forget you!  Rest In peace.&nbsp;
Thank You. A lot of respect. Best regards. 
Hi,  Would like to convey my deepest condolences to Mr. Steve Jobs family and friends. We are losing a great man! Indeed he made a mark in all our hearts.  May his soul Rest In Peace!&nbsp;
iBummer!  Steve, you made making a living on computers more than just a "job". You made it fun. An Adventure. And an opportunity to be not just a better employee, but a better person! You will be missed beyond words...  God Bless You and Your Family,
This is a such a sad day. I had no idea how deeply I'd be affected by this news. Steve's inspiration and legacy will forever be a part of the story of my life. Much love to those who really knew him.
It is impossible to say what Steve Jobs has meant in the life of our family.  We have nothing but Apple computers in our home. We all would have nothing but Apple products for all of our communications. As a result of the iPad, we  have planned and executed a small business. Steve Jobs has been a constant inspiration for well over twenty years to our family. We are grief-stricken at his death as we would be for a family member because he has been an import ant part of our family for such a long time. Thank you, Steve.
The word great is overused today.   But, applied to Steve it is spot on.   Few can compare. The man changed the way we all work, relax &amp; communicate.   Steve Jobs was truly great.   He will be missed by millions.   My prayers and thoughts are with his family and those who were close to him.  Sleep well Steve.&nbsp;
Thanks for challenging the status quo.  Thanks for not being satisfied with less than amazing. &nbsp;Thanks for leading a team that has given our imaginations the tools needed to change the world.
Dear Steve,  You have forever changed our lives and will forever be in our hearts.  You will be greatly missed.  You were my inspiration, my motivation and my hero.  We will never really know how many lives you have enriched with your company and your products.  My condolences go out to your family, friends and Apple employees.&nbsp;
As you got older, your thoughts got better, bigger, apple got bigger and  better and apple is a company that only YOU could of built. So here i  sit, with my iPod Touch, Macbook, and iPad, All Your creations. We will  always remember what a wonderful guy you were.
Steve Jobs, you were a man I wished i had met. You greatness and amazing creativity has influenced my life greatly and will continue to forever influence me for the rest of my life.  Thank you for making such a difference to my life.&nbsp;
I am a techer in a high school and recently&nbsp;in my class we watch the movie "Pirates of Sillicon Valley", it was very good for my students and obviously for me. My students&nbsp;said "it´s incredible is real life story we need to do something similar with our life" I only want to say Thanks Steve Jobs
What an amazing man.  I have owned apple computers and apple products since I first purchased an apple 512. His ideas have influenced the entire computer industry and also overlapped into movies and entertainment. The world is so much better for him being in it and we are going to really miss his genius.
 Thank you for changing the world. You leave behind so many fans,  well wishers and now grievers. I can't begin to say how wonderful of a  person you were in my eyes. A warm smile and a kind heart shines in  lasting memory and hope that your family can hold up ok without your  presence. I love the feeling, that I knew you through the product you  made. You will never be forgotten. You are Apple. I am Apple. Thanks for  every seed you planted, for the roots that spread through the world and  for the fruits of your beautiful mind and efforts. Thank you for Apple.
Here's to a mentor that didn't know me. An inspiration that never met me. A man that led more than he could imagine.  You will never truly be gone. 
To you. From my heart.&nbsp;Thank you.  
Tonight I thank God to have had the chance to live in the same world with Steve. I consider a blessing the many times I saw Steve on tv. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
In memory of Steve Jobs:  I grew to love Apple through my love for my son.  Fred Jr. taught that  apple was the best computer, the best anything that America made. Fred Jr. has loved Mr. Apple (Steve Jobs) since he was fourteen and  while I started later with computers it has become a Family of Apple. Steve Jobs will be remembered with love.
 Thanks for everything steve! you've invented the future for mankind! Rest in peace!                
He was the epitome of courage and conviction.  Glad I lived in his time.
I am sorry to hear that. I still remembered the vibration of my mind after hearing your speech at Stanford university. I still remembered the excitement when I got my first iPad. I do believe your maxim:stay hungry,stay foolish. &nbsp;I will always miss you, The great inspiring mentor of human being. God Bless SJ and all my best to his family and friends. 
I have always been a advocate of open source software, truth be known the move started with Steve being a pioneer in making the computer personal for everyone to enjoy. A hero will be truly missed by billions. 
RIP Steve,   My condolences to the family.
I don't know what I can say......I feel sad...&nbsp;
Rest In Peace Steve and thanks for making my life better through so  many positive technological advances.  You made a real difference in the  way I communicate, listen to music and interact w/friends and family.   May God bless you this day and everyday.    
The world is today without a doubt a much less interesting place to live. Goodbye Steve we all are going to miss you.
Our deepest condolences for all the Apple comunity. For all of us in Argentina, he was also and obviously an idol and a role model.&nbsp;
I'm sure thousands of emails and messages will flow for a long time, but  I just want to say that Steve Jobs inspired many of us to look towards  the world of technology and being practical.  Although many have been  skeptical about Apple and their journey, but I have been a true believer  of a visionary, Steve Jobs.  Now losing a loved one is not easy and I'm certain that the family is  hurt, but please understand that there are millions that look up to  Steve and envision him as the most important individual that has ever  stepped this world.  He will now rest in peace and his visions will live  on through all of those who he has mentored, inspired and touched in one  way or the other.  God Bless!
I am really sorry and I feel really bad about Steve's death. The world lost a genius, one of the greatest geniuses it has ever seen. It is a huge loss for mankind. Unfortunately, there are really few people like Steve, very intelligent and that use the intelligente for making the world better. Unfortunately, we will never see him again showing new apple products, "remaking" the way we see the world, technology, inventions... I really think Steve's death is one of the biggest losses mankind has seen in this century. 
My sincere condolences to beloved friends and family! Thank you Steve, for being Steve God bless you! &nbsp;
Even though I never got the chance to personally meet him, and only knew him  based on what he was like during his infamous keynote sessions, I was always awe struck by the clarity with which he conveyed his visions to the world.  And it was more importantly his visions for this era of computing that truly fascinated me. The way he made the computer more human has had an astounding effect on the world as we know it today. People no longer are limited by how well their devices fit to their needs, and are able to be more productive, and at the same time more creative. It also brings deep inspiration and inventiveness to an area which only years ago was thought to have been at its peak abilities in that respect. All these fruits of his visions are what in part made me want to become an app developer for iOS. In this way, I am able to say that I got to be a part of this revolution in computing. Even though I'm just a small independent developer, I got to be a part of the humanization  of technology. And that is something I will never forget. Every time I see an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or even the name or logo of his legacy, Apple, I will find it hard to think back on what it was like before such things were in existence. And I think for all intents and purposes, it can be said that Steve will live on in Apple's philosophies and practices.
I just want to say to Steve 'Thank you' and 'Good bye'. When I was in Japan, back in 2000, I purchased my first computer which is an iMac. It was truly amazing and the greatest thing I have ever purchased. I will never forget when I turned on my iMac for the very first time in my room. Since then, I had so many great experiences with your products. I am so sad and you will be missed, Steve. RIP
The world is made better because of you. You are in my house, my job, my bedroom and my purse. Thank you.
I remember when I purchased my first Mac.  I've never purchased anything but since.  I've always enjoyed Steve's presentations, and introductions of new products.  I hope Apple lives on, and so does our memories of Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
You've been made a positive tornado in the world, we'll surely miss you.     
He changed the world, we lost a visionary. May he rest in peace.
My sincerest condolences go out to the family and friends of Steve Jobs who were privelged enough to know him personally or professionally. He is one of my major inspirations; a real visionary and dream merchant.  I am deeply saddened by this loss.&nbsp;
Steve you will be sorely missed, the world of technology is truly a lesser place without you.    
"Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being."     My Condolences&nbsp;
My heart and condolences goes out to the family and friends of Mr. Steve Jobs.  My very first computer was an Apple PowerPC in 1990, since then I've owned nothing but Apple products. I've never been more proud of owning a product thats has had and will continue to impact my life in more ways than imagined. Steve was one of the most influential human beings in my life, I can safely say in the WORLD, he will be missed greatly but never forgotten.&nbsp;
Surely a man who will be missed. Steve was more than a business man, but he was like a roll model and was a MAJOR inspiration to me. Since his iPhone key note in 2007, that's where I really started to find out who he was. He'll deeply be missed!&nbsp;
My very good friend, Steve Jobs, he passed today.  He was dear to me and has enriched my life in many ways.  I will miss him but.... He still lives in my home and continues to bring me the means to reach  out to be a seeker. never a follower... thanks to him.&nbsp;
It is so true, World has lost an amazing individual. But I am sure his  presence will remain with all of us and he will be remembered as a great  mentor and an amazing friend for those of you who have had the privilege  of knowing and working with him and also as a great visionary and a tech  geek for all of us that have been given the gift of various apple  products. I guess he had to see the best iPhone launch yesterday before  his soul left his body.
I'm very sad. Is like a family member of my die.  steve we love you. 
A letter to Steve. Thank you for all you have done for all of us. Your vision and your long nights away from your family and friends to bring us all into the light I thank you. I wish you well my friend and even though I did not  know you I feel like you are apart of my family. I have a emptyness in me right now that I just can't explain. I pray for you and your family and for all of us you left behind. I love you and gods speed. You will be missed!&nbsp;
Today we truly lost a great innovator and person. I don't have a iPhone, iPad, or iPod but I know of the brilliance it took for Mr. Jobs to create such world changing products.&nbsp; He is the quintessential American dream, from nothing to more than something truly amazing.&nbsp; We should be so lucky to have just known him and to learn from him.&nbsp; Learn that failure will not keep you down, hard work will take you places, and being something is beyond being rich.&nbsp; I can confidently say if we all live like Mr. Jobs, the world would be a better place. Thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Dear Apple, The world has lost a brilliant person today with the passing of Steve Jobs...he will be missed but never forgotten...Thank you Apple Team for all your continued amazing work &amp; my deepest condolences...I am surrounded by Apple every day, thank you Steve &amp; Apple Team for your vision &amp; passion that changed the world for us!&nbsp;
Steve you could transform minds. &nbsp;Thank you for this..... We pray for you.    
 My prayers go out to the Jobs Family and I wish the best for them. I would like to thank Steve for what he did in his life for society and technology and i hope that his legacy will go on to influence more people in the future.            
Right now, as I am saying good bye to you beloved friend of us all, I have in my hands and in my ears, those objects you shared with us to give our lives meaning.
It is with a heavy heart that I write these words, reflecting in the loss of one of the worlds modern genius.   Steve's vision and skills has enriched many lives, brought fun, entertainment and learning to a whole generation. He, and his company has no doubt made the world a far better place.   May he rest in peace, my thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has changed my world forever. Without him, we would have   never arrived in this new generation.  May he rest in peace.    
I started teaching 28 years ago and our first computer was a little  mac...it was the beginning of BIG things for education.  I am still  hooked with my iPhone iPad and iMac ever creating new and exciting  things for my students and staff!  Thanks for the insight and  innovation!&nbsp;
Rest in peace Genius! We will always be with you! Good luck wherever you are!&nbsp;
I was devastated to hear the news that my favorite tech visionary had  passed away.  I hoped it was just a rumor, but now I see that it is  true via Apple's homepage.  Steve, you were to the personal computing  experience what Nikola Tesla was to electricity: the genius that would  never settle for the "status" quo, who instead of improving bad ideas  would come up with new solutions.  The consumer technological landscape  was carved by the rivers of creativity and innovation brought by you and  the Apple family.  as a true "Apple-only" consumer and computer engineer  I can say that the world, and our field is a less beautiful place  without you.  My heart goes out to your family, and to the Apple family.  Deepest condolences and may you rest in blissful peace.&nbsp;
To the family, friends, and staff...you will be in our prayers!  Carry on his legacy!
In heaven "Stay hungry Stay foolish".
Steve Jobs showed that it is possible to do things right with  technology.  The things he created just seem right.&nbsp;
As one of a tons of people using Apple's products, I am deeply sad beyond any descriptions. You are the best innovative 'IT giant' all we have ever before in this fast-moving world. We've respected your philosophy of your life, accomplishments for IT world, and even your old-fashioned wearing!! ;)  As for right now, we realized we got the greatest loss in the world. But your inspiration would be everlasting for descendants to be another giants for the good future.  Jobs, you opened the every single door for bright, promising likelihood.  We will miss you as an overwhelming role model and a brave mankind with using Apple products.  May you rest in peace again. My condolence to your family.  We really loved you. 
I wish Steve, he could be great happy when he closed his eyes in his last moment.I  am here in Korea, Many people get depressed because of you.Really wish that  Steve can be peaceful forever.    
 It breaks my heart to hear about his passing. It was his  products that inspired me to become a Computer Science student, so that  I could perhaps affect the world in the way that he did. Actually, not  even just his products, but his passion. Viewing his product reveals  every few months became an event to me, to watch him in blue jeans and a  black turtleneck, showing off his work with such pride, knowing that he  and his company was about to change the world. There were very few  people on this earth like Mr. Jobs, and he will be sorely missed. 
Few individuals pass away and leave a legacy that includes fundamentally changing the world in the way we communicate, work, and live. Steve Jobs definitely leaves that legacy.&nbsp;
I'd like to express my deepest sympathy at the untimely passing of Steve Jobs, an outstanding artist and epoch-maker. Now I am remembering my happy Macintosh days.<div><br></div><div>"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past." --Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby</div>
Our condolences to the Jobs family and Apple.  The world has lost a great innovator. He will be sadly missed!&nbsp;
I'm speechless.Really. Rest in peace Steve. I will remember you forever. A really close  parents of me had cancer. I know how terrible is. I love you.&nbsp;
Hi, I'm Brazilian&nbsp;and I just&nbsp;say I'm&nbsp;a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;and Steve&nbsp;Jobs.&nbsp;I'm proud to&nbsp;have lived&nbsp;in the same&nbsp;age of a&nbsp;genius.&nbsp;My condolences&nbsp;to all of you&nbsp;from Apple.  A&nbsp;hug to everyone. &nbsp;Goodbye&nbsp;Steve&nbsp;Jobs.
I'm glad that I could share the same lifetime with Steve Jobs. He definitely made the world better. I deeply hope that you guys can keep going on with his brilliant job.&nbsp;
I don't know Mr. Steve Jobs personally, but I will like to send my  condolences and my prays to his family and friends.
Thanks for the smiles that you put on our faces from all the products that you've helped create.
The world is a better place because of you and your achievements.  This is a tremendous blow to the human race.  God bless. 
Steve Jobs:  I'm very sad that you died, but I'm even happier that you lived. I have my own computer, digital music player, and smartphone, and I can do things now I couldn't even imagine just 10 years ago. Thankfully, you did.  Peace and Respect
I remember every time that Steve did a presentation, how I sat in the  Apple store and didn't want to miss a word. As a former athlete turned journalist, Apple product has meant the world to me. Never will there be  another person to give us as a whole so much. Steve will always be what  Apple stands for - a life cut short but he gave us so much. Thank you.  Today is a sad day in the world. He was truly the icon of many  generations - the Beatles of life! Thanks for iTune, the iPad, iPad and  Mac!&nbsp;
I am so glad that I became a fan of Apple. Steve cared about the world and will be greatly missed
Dear Steve,  Thank you for all you have done, all the inventions and all the amazing devices! Your legend will live on forever through the hearts of millions. As a wise man once said,&nbsp; "I think if you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what’s next."  You are a spirit that will live on forever.  Thank You.
Steve was a visionary in the technological world and was an astonishing human being. We will never forget him.
Hello. I am a 14 year old from Texas. I sincerely express my condolences. I have learned so much from the late Mr. Jobs. His innovation and creativity have inspired me.  His life surely inspired so many people all over the world. “Every man dies - Not every man really lives.” Steve Jobs has lived a truly amazing life. 
Steve was my role model. He led with a strong vision and he made that vision be known to the whole world through his hard work and quality of style. Its so sad to see him pass. Today is truly a sad day and I am taken back that it arrived so early. But now he is somewhere else working on his next project.  My blessings to his family, his Apple team, and his fans.&nbsp;
I remember when I went from having an mp3 player to my first iPod! I like many others have contributed, and evolved with the apple brand. The person who we must remember is Steve Jobbs, he is the visionary of Apple, and whenever I use my apple products I will always remember the man who made all of this possible. I know that Apple as a company will continue to evolve and contribute to our society! Thank you Steve for everything you have given us to date, and through your hard work and motivation will be possible in the future.
To whoever may read this,  I obviously never met Mr. Jobs, nor do I claim to know much about him. What I do know is how the devices he and the rest of the Apple team have created have made the way I communicate with my family much better. For that I can only thank you and express my heartfelt condolences for your loss. God bless.
I admired him greatly. I will pray for his family's healing during this difficult time.
 I'm so sadden to here of the loss of Steve from the other side of the globe in Australia. Although I wasn't even born at the time Steve even created Apple I feel so much a part of his vision. As a college student there's no better mentor I could think of than Steve. As cheesy as it sounds whenever there was a press conference held to launch a new iPhone or iPad I felt that no matter what else was going on in the world, no matter how many wars and global financial crises present, there would always be people like Steve who with perseverance and unique creative genius could bring the world together with something as brilliant and practical as communication technology most people know today as Apple! Thank You Steve for giving us the privilege to experience this world with your genius creations. You will be sadly missed.            
May the creator receive him with open arms close to him.  A truly a humble, intelligent, all outgiving magnificent human being, With his true care for better, he inspire the whole world to a better stage i n all aspect of live.  His memory will be perpetuated by what he has done, and everything was done f or the better of the human race, and not his. A true excellence in all senses.  We must thanks to God for let us had Steve Jobs for the time we had him, that was blessing!!!&nbsp;
As an old-school printer, Steve's vision changed my industry first,   and in that changed my life. I will forever be grateful that my   introduction into the digital world was with Apple in 1992. We lost a   true genius today. 
I got into the Apple game relatively late. My gateway was an iPod Video  back in 2006. Since that critical purchase I've owned 4 iPods, 2  iPhones, 1 MacBook and an iPad. My respect for Apple and Steve Jobs grew  with every purchase. Every single product I've ever bought was near  perfect from the design, the software, even down to the packaging. Even  though Steve is gone I believe that what other's have written is true.  Apple is his greatest creation. I look forward to the future and what  Apple has in store for us.  Thank you, Steve Jobs. Your work has not only changed my life, but it  has changed the world we live in.&nbsp;
To Steve.  Im truly sad that we lost your magic touch. I'm thankful that you at one time recognized me and my associates work on the "Miss Spiders Tea Party" app, and chose it for the initial presentation of the iPad. That felt close even though we never met. I'm going to miss your spirit and I wish you all the best.  With all my heart Peter&nbsp;
I wanted to send my condolences to you and to Apple in mourning of the loss of such a great person as Steve Jobs. I have always admired your company, and hope to work for Apple in the future. I'm currently 18, and growing up with the innovation of Apple has made me feel like a part of the Apple family, watching all your keynotes from the age of 8 on. &nbsp;Steve will be missed and my heart goes out to all of you who have worked with him and whom he has been close with at Apple. God bless during this difficult time. Know your Apple family is with you!&nbsp;
R.I.P Steve.  Thank you for inspiring us.&nbsp;
To the Jobs family, I am so sorry for your loss. the world has lost a national treasure. More importantly, you have lost a husband, a father and a brother. Please know that my love and prayers are going out to you.&nbsp;
One of the most creative and innovative person to have ever lived. He is  the main reason I got so interested in technology and the possibilities  of it. I will truly miss his speeches and keynotes, He will forever be  in my memories as a great man who truly changed the world.  RIP Steve jobs.
May his soul rest in peace!!!! He changed the world and the way it looks. Mr. Jobs is a Da Vinci of new age.  We miss you!!!!!!
The world has lost a pioneer and gained a friend. Thanks to his revolutionary ideas, we can all reach out and touch each other, face to face, from Tahir Square to Hong Kong to our fingertips. It is the greatest change and chance to change and make the world as close as we are: soul to soul. Bless you Steve Jobs. You are our gift that keeps on giving.&nbsp;
So thankful to have had a person like Steve Jobs in this world.  
I can't imagine my life without the work of Steve. The joy I have from using my apple toys every day has filled my life with joy and laughter. I know his legacy will be carried on. This is sad news indeed, but I know his life's work will continue. My sincere condolences.&nbsp;
My deepest and sincere condolences to his family and friends. I don't know Steve Jobs personally, but I used Apple products that have amazed and thrilled me.  Two words to him - Thank you.  I believe he has done his purpose here on earth.
The day Steve died was my last day at apple retail. A coincidence mind you but it made it that much more real and impactful . I never met the man. I admired his innovation, imagination, belief in himself and others and most of all his passion. He loved what he did and strived to be the best at it. He will be sorely missed and remembered as a great man who is proof that if you believe in something and are willing to work hard for it you can go from a garage to the most admired company in the world. My heart goes out to his family and friends. I am sorry for your loss and wish you well.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  Thank you for turning something that could have been a mere utility into a work of art.
I was totally shocked when I logged on to Apple.com to see that Mr. Jobs had  passed.  I want to pass on my condolences to his family and friends. I can' t say how much I admired his work.  Rest in peace Steve.
Mr. Jobs, thank you for all the great inventions. My generation has grown up with portable mp3 players (iPod), iTunes, touchscreen cell phones (iPhones), watching CGI animated movies like Toy Story, tablets (iPad) and most importantly having a personal computer at home. You were an imaginative innovator and at the same time one of the greatest business minds of our times. I'm 24 and you changed the way we all live life. The Edison, the Ford of our times. R.I.P. 
I dont know why I feel such a pain in my heart, I never met you.&nbsp; But I have been buying your products since before they were "cool".&nbsp; I've stuck by my mac for the last 15 years and I still listen to my boxy 2nd gen iPod.&nbsp;    Your brilliance and innovation has forever changed us.&nbsp; I watched Apple grow over the last few years and thought, I knew they were special.  Its because of you Mr. Jobs.&nbsp; You will forever be missed.
My heart goes out to anyone affected by the loss of one of the greatest visionaries for the 21st Century.  Thank you for your contributions to mankind for having any moment of pure happiness in any of your Apple products.  I'm deeply saddened by your loss.  Life's too short on this small planet.&nbsp;
 Your family will forever be remembered in my prayers..... thank you Mr. Jobs for all you have done to make my family forever secured financially.  Your hard work has helped all those that believed in you, your dream and vision.   Forever grateful.
I know you are not reading this, but I just wanted to let you know that  you made such an amazing difference in my life, and billions of others'.  You have empowered our lives with amazing technology and innovation that  only could come from Apple. You will be missed by millions. Thank you Apple! 
I'm only 15, I know many people might think I would be too young to understand what it means when a man such as Steve jobs dies (RIP) , but I understand very well and I wish to send my condolences and my respects to his family. I also wish his family would continue living a happy life because thanx to Mr Jobs I have had a fun and creative life thanks to his inventions and all the thought he put it into everything he had made and help create.
I am sorry to hear of Steve Job's death.  We are about the same age, and  I hope I can do something that will have the save positive effect his  life did.
 Steve,  I'd only really become inspired by your work when I bought my first iPhone, the iPhone 4. Throughout the last year, I have grown to recognize your pure &nbsp;rilliance and undying dedication to making the world a simpler place.
  The world has lost one of the greatest visionaries of all times. He inspired and changed the lives of billions of people, including myself. If there is one thing inside me, now that I know the news, it is deepest sadness. I hope that he stays forever in the minds of all of us, who will always remain stunned by his brilliant ideas.  Thank you for being who you were, and who you will remain being inside all of us.
Thank you for being you, I'll see you in the cloud!             
Thank you Steve for having inspired me with your genius and your passion  for life and beauty. We will miss you, the power of your ideas will help us to be better  human beings.  You are amazing! Goodbye!
I have had Apple computers from the Lisa present.  What a company he  started, and all the great toys he made possible to all of us novice.  Thanks Steve.    
The history of this great man has always been an inspiration to me since I started using computers.  There is only one thing I would say. Thank you Steve.
There are many people who accomplished their dreams, but rarely do people accomplish greatness.  Steve Jobs accomplished both.  I have very few people I look up to and Mr. Jobs is one of them.  Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
It is so sad the Steve Jobs died. I cannot believe that he rose the  company of Apple up to the highest company in America.  Almost all of  the technology in my house is from Apple. It is truly a brilliant and  helpful company that people worldwide benefit from. Thanks so much Steve  for all that you did and sacrificed for your company. RIP 
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs  Thank you for bringing such innovation, excellence and excitement to our lives and the lives of those who follow on after us. Our world would have been so different without you and the Apple team.Just this morning at 12.10am I met my daughter sitting at the top of the stairs, and she was booking in to a seminar using her ipod. No big deal?  This is a university student who seldom spends her money but finally decided to purchase an ipod - just last week and she is now enjoying the excitement of discovering all that an ipod has to offer. Thank you for making her life so much easier. 
My condolences for the family of Steve Jobs   he was a great visionary, smart and a leader    and for you apple keep his name up work and create things from which he would be proud.    we will catch up later!
Thanks for helping me learn to celebrate excellence.
We have truly lost one of the world's greatest geniuses. I'm only 12  years old but because of Steve Jobs and all the hard work he's done,  it's made life a lot more enjoyable. My family lives for Apple. We own  an iPad 2, an iMac, 2 laptops, and about 5 iPods, thanks to you Steve. We will miss you dearly. My best regards to his close friends and family.
Steve's innovation not only changed industries, but changed my life as well. His products in the hands of small self employed people like myself, made us compete with corporations in the creative markets.  May God continue to give his family peace and strength during this time of loss. Thank you, Steve, for always seeing beyond the horizon.&nbsp;
 I just found out that Steve passed away... I feel heartbroken at this  great loss... I've spent most of the Summer at my Apple store designing  a new website. If it wasn't for the graciousness of your company and how  you provide above and beyond service to your customers, the skills I am  learning wouldn't be happening.... Steve you changed countless lives by  what you brought to this world. I know you and your company have  certainly changed mine... Thank you, from the bottom of my heart for all  that you created, gave and accomplished and what now lives on because of  you....&nbsp;
I can assure you that many more Malaysian like me will miss the presence of Steve Jobs. Never seen the man in person, doesn't mean we can't recognize him. But just to watch men carrying iPhone all over the street of Kuala Lumpur really show how a man can influence the world. RIP Steve Jobs. 
Thank you for giving us products that only you could ever thought of. More t han that thank you for being such an inspiration to alot of us. Your life story, your passion for apple and willingness to achieve greatness is unbeatable.
This man was a great example of what we all are capable of as human beings. I  hope to one day reach if not surpass this man's influence on modern day society. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. You will live forever because you will not be forgotten!
Who was the one who I did not know, but I could see him all around me, streets, subway, airports, meetings, movie theaters, tv ads, he was not there but his ideas were, &nbsp; Inspiring, blindly forward-thinker, taught the industry how to think, how to lead, how to be the first no matter what others said. Yes, he did not do it alone but he inspire others to follow him, sometimes in opposite directions. The world needs more Jobs, "Steves Jobs" to show us that there is no end to an idea, there will be many other ideas that will need to be created to solve our human being lives. Steve, wherever you are now, illuminate us who work on new ideas everyday and look for WOW solutions for our lives. Thank you for inspiring me all these years!
 Dear Steve, We love you all the time, all the ways.            
I am so sorry to hear that Mr. Jobs passed away today.  Since the mid-80's, I can't think of a time when I did not own an Apple device.  Mr. Jobs knew what I needed before I knew I needed it.  I will miss his appearances at product launches because he explained to me how the product he was demonstrating could make me more productive (e.g., my iPad) or better yet how I could rediscover the joy of assets I already owned (e.g., my iPod Touch).  Mr. Jobs, I will miss your vision.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve has long been my idol. I own many Apple products and will continue to support Apple. Thank you for everything you have done for us Steve. RIP. 
I was truly shocked upon hearing of Steve’s death! I could not believe that such a person had just departed so quietly. I always imagined he would have gone out in style but, i guess to some extent, he has gone in style, with Apple still going strong and all.  I have never known him personally but i extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends and co-workers.   Steve Jobs will always be remembered for his excellent work with technology and his memory and work will always live on.
I never knew Steve but I wish I did. It's not about the companies Steve created but the foundations he set  for the future. His dreams became reality and that's why I love Apple.&nbsp;
Hi Steve, I know you're in the after life and your looking above from the iCloud. I  literally teared up and cried because I know you were awesome. I always  imagined of meeting you but I knew it wouldn't happen since I'm in  Chicago. I can't believe your gone.  :( 
I am his fan from China, and I am using iPhone which I bought in March, 2008. It remains perfect. My wife told me he passed away this morning, it is hard for me to take it. We are all encouraged by his fearless and creativity.&nbsp;
 Thanks Steve Jobs for being such an eye opener and visionary person in your job. You were the best in what you did.
Steve,  Thanks for bringing us life, music, fun in a easy and cool way. I am sure that you'll  improve heaven a lot before we go. You're the man! You'll be missed.  Rest In Coolness.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. Your life's work has broken the chains that had bound countless minds from realizing their creative dreams due to technical limitations. Your vision has made the world a better place.  Peace. 
I recieved my first mac book pro and only mac in the end of the summer  of 2009. It was the best thing ever and still is. I use it almost  everyday and love it. I think and still think that Steve Jobs was the  greatest inventor ever and creates great things. I also have a I-pod  touch which is great too. Steve jobs will always be remembered as a great person and inventor.
The news shocked me today when I heard of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve has made such a big influence on how we use technology today. I remember my dad had the very first Apple computer that was made. I really didn't know Steve personally but I know that he is in a better place right now. Hopefully he can even show the lord some of his useful technology!
 While I wasn't an Apple user, I always deeply admired Steve Jobs for his ingenuity and entrepreneurship.  He raised the bar for all others aspiring to be successful in business and the pursuit of their dreams.  Quite simply, the world will be less without him.  My sincerest sympathies go out to Steve's family and friends in this time of grief.
Sincerely touched. The world has lost another genius, a true "renaissance man" of our times, who has gone much too early.
 My public figure has passed away... I hope there are more people like Steve out there. The world is praying for you now...&nbsp;
 I will pray for him and his family. He clearly has a great purpose on this earth and he clearly fufilled it. I am so so ever grateful!  Peace and  prayers 
Thanks for your visionary way and to make it available to all of us. You will be remembered everyday, everyday. Rest in peace.
Steve changed the whole world with his great inventions; we Love u steve &amp; will alwayz.
I am really devastated after hearing the legend of the legends has died ...he will live long in many peoples hearts. A. true  businessman I admire him a lot..  my deep condolences
Dear Steve,  You are no longer with us but your time here on Earth was incredibly memorable. &nbsp;I just wanted to thank you personally for not only the great products you have provided but showing the incredible spirit that you possessed. &nbsp;I would have loved to have met you but never got the opportunity. &nbsp;I am a college student and I try to model myself after that great spirit that you displayed. &nbsp;It has showed me to shoot for the stars and never settle. &nbsp;I plan to attain my PhD eventually and will remember your words forever. &nbsp;My condolences to your family. May God be with you.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs, I'm a user of Apple living in Korea. After I purchased a product of Apple, I was impressed by a company named Apple  and innovation of a man Steve Jobs who was a CEO leading the company. But I knew today that you passed away.  I'm really sorrowful with it. Hope you rest in peace watching Apple leading today's society.    
Sad news to hear the passing of Mr Jobs. &nbsp;I did not know him, though I did admire him. &nbsp;My prayers go out to his family and friends.
Quite simply, he made the world a better place.   For those who didn't know  him personally, Inspiring, empowering, entrepreneur, industrialist, philanthropist, environmentalist, visionary are just a few words describing this  gentleman.  My condolensces to Steve's family- both at home and around the world.&nbsp;
Steve was truly one of the most amazing human beings ever to live.  Our prayers are with Steve, his family and co-workers that had the privilege of knowing him and working with him in person.  I would have done anything to meet him in person.  God Bless you Steve.  You will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
The world has known few like you - da Vinci, Edison, and Jobs. Your contribution to mankind will live forever, and open the door for the next. Thank you.
Steve Jobs knew people. He knew how to learn about them, their dislikes and habits. He also knew how to identify things that people wanted (before they knew themselves). And most importantly, he knew how to teach people what they wanted and (eventually) needed. I've watched Steve's Stanford Commencement Address many times, and each time I come away with something new that I only hope to instill in my two young children some day. As I look at their faces and think about what challenges they will face in their worlds, I find comfort in three ideals:  the hunger to learn, the courage to explore and the risk in trying  - much like Steve wished for those graduates that sunny day in 2005.  May God bless Steve, his family and his friends at Apple.   Thank you.  
He&nbsp;may not be with us anymore, but his legacy will never die.
My condolences go out to Steve's family. The vision to join art and  science into products that change the world was Steve's alone. 
Hemos perdido a una gran persona, a un gran visionario... alguien  irreemplazable. Feliz descanso Jobs
Dear Representatives at Apple, I send my condolences to Apple over their loss. I've had my  Macbook and iPhone since 7th grade (I am a Junior in High School now),  and I must say that if I didn't have either, I would not have been as  productive as I am now! Steve really changed the world in many aspects,  and I feel that without him, the world wouldn't have been just the same.  Rest in Peace Steve, you shall not be forgotten.&nbsp;
I want to send my condolences to Steve's family. He was an amazing person. His mark on this world, and modern culture as a whole, will be felt for a long time. His incredible passion and love for technology was an inspiration to  me personally. He was truly one of a kind. He will be missed very much&nbsp;
Like so many others I'm deeply saddened to hear of Steve's death. He has had  an immeasurable impact on the way I use technology - I'm writing this on my  iPhone, whilst watching a movie on my apple tv. I listen to music that I AirPlay to my apple tv from my iTunes on my iMac, iPhone or (god forbid) my pc . Steve jobs has directly influenced how I do things every day.
I cannot imagine the world without the innovations that Steve Jobs gave us. I  cannot imagine the world without his brilliant mind, but know that it is a greater world because of him and now a lesser world without him. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. May they find some solace in our  deep appreciation of him and what he has given us.&nbsp;
You will always be remembered as one of americas greatest heroes. RIP Steve Jobs, you will be deeply missed. 
Dear Steve,  Thanks for your contribution to our earth. People will remember you for ever.
 Apple and the computer world would not be what it is today without the one in a lifetime genius of Steve Jobs.  I'm glad to have lived during his time.
Hello,  I'm from Brazil, and just wanna say that today is a very sad day to me,  Steven represent so much to the modern tech, to me he is the father of  so much great stuff! God help us all now! I hope Steven is in a better place and happy to see his work going on. &nbsp;
Hearing the news today has really saddened me, my heart goes out to all of those that met Steve, an opportunity I can only now leave to imagination. I was happy to have had the chance to work for Apple and received a group email  from Steve; the closest I was to get to the great man. He has touched the lives of more than he could ever realize. I wish his family all of the love a nd support possible and hope they are left in peace by the media to mourn th eir huge loss. Steve has been rewarded with his place in heaven and history. You will be missed Steve, by thousands of people you never knew existed. Enjoy your peaceful place.
I am an avid Apple fan and am so sad to hear the loss of Steve Jobs,   and even though I never met him I have always admired him and his   inventions...  I am sure you will have millions of people mourning his   demise all over the world. &nbsp;
I never needed to personally know Steve Jobs. I feel lucky to be alive when he was on this earth and have felt the creative genius Steve gave the world in my first experience with the Apple IIe. I've been with Apple ever since, from the IIc and a succession of products to our current MacBook Pro and iPad products. My next purchase will be the Job's inspired iPhone. His imprint is on the succession of products and companies throughout the years, including Pixar. He's made the world a better place in an infinite number of ways. To infinity and beyond, Steve.  
Today is a sad day. I'm a Steve's great fan. It was a privilege to live in the same period that Steve Jobs and see with my own eyes the revolutions that he did. Probably these revolutions my children will study in school, but they will never fully understand, as far as I understood. And lived. RIP.
I've worked on Macs for the past twenty years, every day. I feel that Steve Jobs  has been behind me throughout my career, continually coming out with cooler,  sleeker, more user friendly computing devices for me! I never met Steve in  person, but I feel that I've lost a friend.
RIP Steve Jobs. Irrespective of one's view of Apple, or you, you changed the computer industry, indeed the world, forever. We thank you for your ingenuity, your dedication to your craft, and your willingness to take great risks to see your visions through. The world is a better place because of you and you will never be forgotten.
I am so grateful for the many ways that Steve Jobs improved the quality of my family's life.  We will never forget you. 
Working for Apple Retail for a year I am deeply saddened by the loss of our founder and I know his dream will continue way beyond his time in this world.   Always.
Some people look to comic books or sports teams for their heroes. But  I looked to Steve Jobs, Rest In Peace Sir, here is to Thinking  Different.   
Truly one a revolutionary entrepreneur. He will be sorely missed. Steve, this century was yours for the taking.
I wanted to pass my condolences to Apple and his family and also to his audience of millions of fans. Steve was an inspiration for me which has made me determined to start my own business. That was 4 weeks ago. Today I've registered my own company name and traiding and running a web design business here in Adelaide, Australia. R.I.P Steve! You're one of the legendary entrepreneurs!&nbsp;
My dear Apple friends;  From time to time one human being shapes the lives of the rest of use. Commonly they come from politics or religion...the social and cultural fabric of our lives. Not very often scientists and inventors shape the world. Typically it is done by what they create. A thing that determines the lives of others.   Although Steve Jobs shaped lives through his invention he shaped mine through communicating the essence of quality in the human world. These are the ideas that shaped me and are now part of my fabric as an individual. As an Apple Creative I learned to be concerned about humanity first, technology second. Products were simply tools to help solve the problems or better yet unleash the potential of us all. Perhaps no other creative genius enabled that more that the work Apple did...lead by Steve Jobs.  Edison's lightbulb and phonograph were startling and entertaining. They improved life but had limited impact on people's innate talents. Ford's automobile moved us from place to place. But the creations of Apple (Mr. Jobs) not only made our lives and ideas more moveable....they allowed an individual expression and freeing of creative energy that has never been before. We all owe a great debt to Steve Jobs. I know I personally do.  When I was in training in Cupertino I saw Steve on campus. Really a down-to-earth type of man. Yet he believed in big ideas and trusted his own. And he wanted us all to trust ours...to think different...to think for ourselves. That is a lesson the world needs now more than ever.  In that vein I plan to redouble my own efforts to...change the world.  So, continue to think and act big Apple friends. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.  Thank you Steve!&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs, One of the most influential people of all time..  You will be greatly missed.  Deep condolences.
 RIP Steve Jobs, you will live on in our daily lives through every past, present *and future* Apple innovation...&nbsp;
My heart and mind have gone silent. Thank you Steve for changing the world; you are legendary...  From one of your millions of fans&nbsp;
Hi,  I would like to offer my condolences to the family of the brilliant innovator, Steve Jobs. I'm sure his name will be remembered not only by his family and by the people who know him and work with him, but also by every business man, engineer, and innovator in the world. He is a role model for many; I know he's my role model.
Steve Jobs marked the world. Changed my day to day with his genius.  Steve Jobs, Your imprint cannot filled by anyone else. Thank you for  allowing us to take a peek into your mind through the works of iPod,  iPhone, and what I am currently typing on, my Macbookpro... You will be  missed
 Steve, may you rest in Peace.  You are a creative genius and have changed all our lives for the better.  So, as a proud Apple products owner, I want the  join the millions of us throughout the world in thanking you.THANK YOU....
My heart felt condolences to Mr. Jobs' family.  He will be in my thoughts everyday. I live surrounded by his legacy.&nbsp;
My heart and thoughts go out to his family and friends. I have followed Apple for a long time. Apple is not just a brand. Apple is not just a software or a gadget. Apple is the glue that brought and will continue to bring people from all walks of life together. Steve Jobs is Apple and Apple will always be Steve Jobs.  While we lost a special human being we have gained a spirit of hope and love for all things. He will be missed.&nbsp;
He was the man, he was the reality and he will always be a legend. 
It is rare to live among legends, but Steve Job was a real-time legend. His genius transformed our existence, and his legacy is incalculable. Our hearts and prayers go to Laurene, his children, and the Apple family.&nbsp;
A rare few of us may not have known his name until his resignation from Apple, even more do not know him personally, but almost everyone in this world has been affected by what he has done in his lifetime. The impact of his work and passion has been felt by millions all over the planet, and that feeling was definitely a good one. Mr Jobs has made an even greater and more heartfelt influence in our daily lives than most politicians ever will. He has done so much for us, and we will always remember him.  From myself and many more in Singapore, our deepest condolences are extended to his family and friends. His passing is also a great loss to the modern tech community; he is an irreplaceable genius.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve from Argentina. You've changed the world!            
I will miss him forever. It feels like I lost part of me. He was my inspiration to invent. I will never forget !!!!!Steve Jobs!!!!!!!My friends made shirts that say We Miss U Steve Jobs!!!!!!!!!!! I will miss u forever !!!Steve Jobs!!!! 
I am typing on a Mac, with one beside me as well. I have them in other  rooms and in the attic. Big and small, new and old. Thanks for providing  for those who think differently - even after everyone else seems to  agree. Beauty, design, engineering and flair. I am sad. Thank you. I pray for comfort for your family and that those you have inspired will  continue to innovate. My condolences and thanks.&nbsp;
Simply, thanks for making technology beautiful. The world is blessed to  have had visionaries like you who are able to see when other cannot.
I got to know Jobs from the book of The Presentation Secrets of Steve  Jobs, which is a kind of turning point of my life. I would not say that I  am creative, but Being Innovative became more and more visible in my life.  I feel so sad when I read the news. However, Jobs spirit will stay, which  will be a continuous support to me.
  Steve Jobs lives on. Thank you Steve Jobs. 
Steve and all at Apple,  Thank you for connecting me to all my family and friends so that I can enjoy  God's greatest gifts of life and love.
innovator, Visionary, Role Model 
Steve, Your life was great, because you were so brave and never stop living  your dream. And the  world became so great because you were born. I will keep your words in mind forever and go live my dream.
Hi Steve You are the leader and best CEO in the world. You guide all of us how to live and demostrate how to live the best of our lives.  God be with you.&nbsp;
I have used Macs since I began using a computer. Apple has been part of  my daily life, my entire life. I wouldn't be the person I am with the  values and experiences I have without his incredible passion and vision  to change the world.  He's my personal hero and I am so saddened to hear he is no longer with  us and that I will never be able to spend two minutes with him. My  thoughts are with his family and will be constantly reminded of his  influence every day for the rest of my life.  Thank you. Thank you, Steve. You are missed.
I never knew Steve, but it is obvious how much of an impact he has made WORLDWIDE.  His vision of beautiful, functional technology has set the standards for modern technology that is used on a daily basis.  There are people all over the world carrying Steve's legend in their pocket right now, typing on his creations right now, watching TV through his products right now.  Apple/Mac would not be what it is today without Steve.  Technology would not be what it is now without Steve.  I'm sure those closest to him would not be who they are today without Steve.  It is always sad to lose somebody of such importance.  My condolences to those closest to Steve... 
 I was only 9 when I got my first iPhone. Now I'm 13. I knew everything about Steve Jobs, his life, his disease. He is a role model for me and thousands of other kids my age.  RIP Steve Jobs. You will be missed deeply.
iSad! my thoughts go out to his family and friends .. your work changed  the world may you rest in peace from my mac with love Awasha Kuwait! 
As a musician, I hold Steve responsible for changing the music industry through the iPod and iTunes, allowing not only an effective, mobile distribution system, but along with the advances in home studio technology, a means by which independent musicians could find an audience for their efforts. The indie music world should be forever in Steve's debt as an artistic game changer.&nbsp;
Steve,  I wish we could have met.  You were one of my adult heroes for the past two decades.  Thank you for fighting the good fight.  Thank you for your vision.  You will be missed.  Peace to you and your loved ones.
Dear Mr Jobs,  Thank you for all you have done. Your vision and brilliance have changed the world forever. I remember back in the early 1980's when I first used an Apple Lisa computer. I thought to myself at the time in my early teenage years. This is going to change the world. And you did. Bravo! You will be missed but your legacy will live on and inspire new visionaries and bright minds to follow in your footsteps.  My condolences to your family. I recently lost my mother to pancreatic cancer and I understand what you and your family where going through.
Steve you were a great man. Who knows what the world would be like if  you were never here! You will be remembered as more than a man to me  always. Thank you again steve god speed! 
I never knew Steve Jobs except as a figure in the news, but I've always been an Apple/Mac user since I computers first started showing up at school when I was small. Today, I work as a software developer, doing work that is so much more fun and fulfilling than I ever thought work could be, and if it weren't for my lifelong experiences using Apple products and, as a result, coming to expect that technology should be fun and accessible and intuitive and should really open up new worlds, I doubt I would be in the place I am now. Thank you Apple, and thank you Steve Jobs.
My condolences goes out to his family.  The world lost a great man and a genius.
 You and your family are in my thoughts and prayers.  Thank you for being the genius you are!  Rest in Peace.
My first Apple computer was an Apple II serial # in the 4000s in the late '70s. Many II's, IIGS's, IIc's, IIe's, a plethora of Macs, both desktops and laptops for both work and home, an iPod, and this iPad2, have continued to accompany me each step into the future for over 30 years! May Steve's dream and legacy keep us company as the future continues to unfold!&nbsp;
It's not often that the passing away of a company founder and CEO saddens people who have never met him or worked for him,&nbsp;and inspires them to say something. But Steve Jobs changed our lives, opened up so many possibilities to a whole generation and to our children too.He made so many things easy and fun for us; enabled people to do things they ordinarily couldn't have achieved.&nbsp;Those of us who didn't know him will miss him too and will be forever thankful to him for his inspirations and gifts to us. My kids, here in Tokyo, went into school silently this morning - with a sense of sadness and loss. That says a lot for Mr Jobs.
Dear Apple Corporation  I just heard on the radio about the tragic loss of Steve Jobs and I wish the best for his family and friends.  He will hopefully be remembered by the people as a genuis and a technological innovator.  It was truly his vision that pushed on the apple corporation into what it is now known as one of the biggest software company's in the world.  May the man rest in peace.&nbsp;
I am sorry to see a great visionary leave us. He and the team at Apple  have made my life so much easier with the production of such great  product, Mac, Iphone, to name a few things. I pray that you guys  continue your commitment to producing great machinery and commit to  continuing to change the world.
To most of us, Steve was this cool guy who seemed to be a DaVinci genius taking us through doors glimpsing the future, while capturing the imagination of throngs of people.&nbsp;But more importantly he was a special person to those who loved him best.&nbsp;I'd like to extend my sincere condolences to his children, his wife, his entire family, and all those who knew him best.&nbsp;I lost my father two years ago and it's still hurts.&nbsp;This must be so hard for Steve's kids&nbsp;but they can be immensely proud of their father and have a warm, peaceful, feeling he did not leave this world with deep regrets or a sense of what could have been. &nbsp;His was a wonderful life.
Thank you to an amazing man,I just heard about Steve Jobs passing. So very sad. Thank you for your passion, ingenuity and commitment to quality. You'll be missed greatly.How many people have had such a positive impact on the lives of millions?The starts just got a  little brighter tonight but the world lost a driven and passionate man.I wish I could aptly communicate how much I appreciate his dedication.
Hello! I would like to share my condolences for Steve Jobs. He was a  great man, and a great inspiration to us all. In fact, I am typing this  from a Mac. I hope that Apple continues its rich and exciting ideas even  without the help of someone like him. Again, I am so sorry.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a visionary into the future. Today the world has lost this visionary. My condolences to Apple and all its employees on its untimely loss. And for Steve, he made his ping in the world.
 Amazing person!  He will be so missed by all!!  RIP, Steve. 
I never knew the man, never dreamed of talking to him, but I owe him a lot! Steve, thanks for a GREAT phone, a fantastic laptop and one of the best jobs in the world!!&nbsp;
Your influence and legacy will continue forever, you are truly an example of  perseverance, courage and will.  You'll be surely missed but mostly remembered with a smile and lots of admiration.  Descansa en paz
You are and will always be remembered for bringing us to the next level of technology. My condolences goes to your family and friends and your legacy will  always be with us! Once again, thank you and see you soon.
Steve, thanks for making the world a better place to live!!  Go Apple!! 
We are all using steve's product to spread the sad news of his death.  What a  genius.  What a loss to our world!
Thank you is a very simple basic response to a  kindness one does for you.  The magnitude of the contributions of Steve's talent,  genius, vision and  genuine desire to deliver the dreams of the future in the  here and now is a  testament to the legacy he leaves.     I personally learned how to use a computer on an  Apple II in 1996. I cannot  now or ever be  able to complete a list of all the things I am now able to do  because of  what Steve Jobs gave to mankind through his genius.      So from all of mankind, I am sure they would in the  over 150 languages  spoken in this world join me and say...Thank You.     To his family and colleagues, may his memory be a  blessing to you all  and may you only join again for happy occasions.&nbsp;
Dear everybody - Keep 'leading' Apple, from 'Think Different' to 'Think Unique'.  I will remember Jobs and support Apple forever.&nbsp;
There are no words to express the loss I feel right now. May his soul rest in peace and may god give his family and friends the strength to bear this loss.They are all very lucky to have known Steve personally. He touched our lives in more ways than one, with technology, with vision and with inspiration to go beyond the norms.&nbsp;
     good bye steve you made me think different , i apreciate all what u gave to the world as human being and bussiness man, thanks for all             
Spiritually that is! We love and miss you Steve! Wish this wasn't the end!!&nbsp;
The World is a much better place because you have lived in it.  Thank you for your leadership and vision.  My thoughts are with your family and friends tonight.
I just wanted to say that I give my condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and friends.  The world has indeed lost a creative genius and global visionary.  His memory and legacy will live on not only with his products but with the lives he's touched and inspired.  While the world has lost an icon we can find peace in the fact that it was changed for the better in the brief time he was able to influence it. 
More than change the world, Steve Jobs has changed the life of people, this is much more important.&nbsp;Thank you Steve for change my life and make people happy. This changes the world.  
We are very saddened by the death of Steve Jobs. &nbsp;He has been a visionary and a revolutionary man.  My condolences to his family and the Apple family.
Steve, Thank you for touching my life in ways you can't imagine. I was especially inspired by your fighting spirit to persist to create value despite your battle with cancer. I am also a 4th stage cancer patient and undergo the process of living but you inspired me to never settle and not be burdened with others' opinions. I wish you the best in your future journeys and till the next tryst with life, Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish...  With deepest appreciation.
Thanks for making this world a better place to live - R.I.P.  
 Steve, you changed the technology industry with not the most revolutionary, but evolutiionary devices in the history of man kind. I am extremely proud to have an Apple iPhone, and use the iMac and Macbook at school, and they are extremely evolutionary. I love Apple and all of its glorious products. and I hope one day to own every Apple product there is. I hope that you Steve get to look down from heaven at all of the Apple stores and watch people become amazed at the products Apple has to offer, and i wish while you do that you get to show  God how  to use the iMac, iPhone, iPod, iPad, and all of the other terrific products your amazing company has created for years. R.I.P Steve Jobs, Apple will always be great because of you!  
                    He was a great man.                      
My deepest condolences to the Jobs family.  There are some people who although you haven't met personally touch you personally, for me Steve Jobs did that.  I thank him for the innovative products that he helped developed and the positive impact he's had on the world that we live today. 
I'm so happy to have grown up in such a progressive technological era,  and have a true admiration for the world Steve Jobs opened all of us up  to. Cheers to you Steve Jobs. Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
I want to wish my sincere condolences to Steve's family  and to all  employee of Apple.   May his spirit be in our minds forever.    R.I.P   Steve Jobs    thank you so much for all you've done, &nbsp;you made  computer life so much easier.
As far as I can tell, the legacy left by Steven Jobs to Apple - and to the rest of us - is that a company can thrive and even win not by being cheaper, faster, and simpler, but simply by being better.&nbsp;
You changed the world and made it a better place.  I will always remember you.  May you rest in peace and may your close friends and family have the strength to move on.&nbsp;
May his memory be for a blessing
 Le monde vient de perdre un génie et un visionnaire, sincère condoléance.&nbsp;
Thank you for three decades of Inspiration. Thank you for see things differently. Thank you for being who you are.  Farewell.&nbsp;
Rest in peace one of the greatest minds of technology.... we're all   goin to mis you!!! 
An amazing person who created amazing products. He lives on through the  genius of his creations.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for revolutionizing the way I work and play.&nbsp;
Dear Steve, You were the symbol of America to me. You were a pioneer, and the figure of what every person can be, with a dream.  You created the greatest company on earth, and we are great because of you.  You will truly be missed, and Apple will live on in your memory. Rest in peace Steve.
Lots thanks to you and your team. World is a better place because there are people who are looking for new and stunning products, like you. Farewell, steve. We'll always remember you and the one more thing.&nbsp;
I just don't know what to say.  Words can't do justice to the accomplishments and change brought about by just one man, who regrettably and unfortunately died in his prime.  I only wish Steve can continue seeing the impact he has made, and the thriving of the company he has built. He envisioned a dream, and lived that dream as a true, sincere person.  As a CEO who was ousted from his own company, Steve picked himself up and continued taking steps forward.  As a returned veteran to a dream he calls home, he passionately revitalized a losing company with renewed vigour.  His accomplishments are his legacy, and his passion and attitude are our inspiration.  As much as I respect his achievements, it's his attitude, and genuine passion to live his life doing what he WANTS to do that I truly admire.
A life changing man, who will be remembered for generations to come. I would not be who I am today without his inspiration.
We are heartbroken to hear this news, and simply wanted to express our  deepest condolences.
Thanks steve for all you have done for my life and others as well. because of your vision, i can talk and see the woman i love the most just with the touch of an icon. I think you were an icon, a worldwide icon!  Many many thanks and god bless you.
 He put a heart on the technology world making logical to have a "personal computer".   Thanks dreamer Steve! Angels receive and give you peace.
I can't believe it is true, I have been using Apple products since the IIci and have built my current business model from the entrepreneurship that I learned from Steve Jobs. My condolences go out to the entire Jobs family. My thoughts and prayers are with you during this incredible difficult time. Steve will live on in the hearts of all Apple (Macintosh) fans forever!
We will never forget you Steve, go in peace. 
Today we lost a creative genius mastermind in Steve Jobs, his kind of  brilliance is not so easy to find.  He changed the world we all live in today and  for that I am thankful.  Sweet dreams Steve.
Steve was an amazing person, a master innovator, and the greatest thinker in the entire technology industry. He wanted simplicity, he made simplicity. He was focused on making sure everything Apple made was perfect. He has done so much for the world, and his legacy will live on for years to come. I'm sure Steve had many more products and theories in mind. It is terribly saddening that his life ended so early. He could have done so many more things, if only given the time.  Rest In Peace, Steve. You will never be forgotten.
I remember waiting in anticipation for the Macworld Keynote of years  past just to watch how smooth, strong and cool the keynote presentation  would be. I value Steve's ability as a communicator.  Thanks and prayers  for the family.
Steve, you made a difference around the world. You made technology fun and easy and amazing. The terms Computer Geek and Nerd no longer have the same connotation because of you. I met my husband at a Mac User Group decades ago and my world is filled with products from your mind. You have had an impact on my life and you will be missed. Sorry this day has come so soon. Thank you for all of your contributions and your inspiration.
Thank you Steve, we will remember you forever!&nbsp;
He was amazing to me even before I learned about him when I only knew of  him as the Creator of Apple Inc. Starting Apple as well as  an other  computer/technology company as well as taking hold of Pixar is an  amazing set of feats.  The world really has lost an amazing human being, and Apple really has  lost a visionary and creative genius with true depth of vision.  May he rest in peace. 
My life has been profoundly impacted by Steve Jobs and Apple. I went back to school in 1981 at the age of 38 and the first computer I worked on was an Apple IIe. I've owned nothing but Apples ever since and have done my damndest to influence my family and friends toward Apple. The man was an imaginative genius and I feel like American has lost one of the great artists of the 20th and 21st Century.&nbsp;
i got one of yours in my hand. iProud. iThanks. rest in peace, Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
This is such a shocking moment. I cannot believe the person who changed  technology has passed away. It's a very shocking moment for many around  the world. 
Steve RIP. Thank you for having shaped one of the greatest companies  ever existed and for having given life to an easy way to communicate and  to be connected with the entire world.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,  You have lost someone truly exceptional today. Words cannot express the impact Steve has had on this planet. We should hope that his legacy lives on in the Apple brand, and in the people who follow in his footsteps. He represents true success, as well as a model of what people should become.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
I’ll always be my source of inspiration. Thank You, Steve Jobs.
The most amazing worldwide respected CEO of his generation. A pioneer in design, marketing, tech and leadership. Your Apple legacy on this small planet will live on for generations. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for making technology fun for everyone! You will be forever missed and never forgotten.  God's speed.
I am truly saddened by Steve's death. I really can't describe this loss in human words. Steve will always be remembered and will live, in thoughts that transform human life,  inspiration for new ideas, ideas that take us beyond imagination and human being, for countless light years to come.&nbsp;
Our deepest Sympathy to Steve Jobs family, friends co-workers at Apple....he was a pillar of strength, motivation and influence for all .....he will never be forgotten and his spirit will live on in Apple and in the hearts of all who knew Steve.  My deepest sympathy.
As a web developer in his 40's I cannot thank Steve Jobs enough for all  that he has done for my life.  I don't even know where to start.  If  those of us who are left behind are able to focus and harness our own  visions like Steve did for us.
I cried, I haven't spoken since. The man inspired me so much. May his great soul rest in peace. We love you Steve. 
Estoy tipeando esto en mi Macbook Air...aún sin salir de mi asombro por tu  muerte...  Gracias a tu vision y al esfuerzo de quienes inspiraste por crear cosas  tan buenas.  Que Dios vea que gracias a tus ideas, dejaste un mundo mejor del que  encontraste.  Un abrazo a toda la comunidad MAC.&nbsp;
I am so sad about Steve Jobs death, he was my inspiration, someone who I wish I could be like.
Mr. Jobs, God be with you in this new voyage, you will be rememberer by all apple lover like me, rest in peace and thank you for shining the world with your inteligence and criations, you will be always in the head and the&nbsp;hart of all apple family, because this is what you did, create a big&nbsp;united global family. be with god, thank you.
If the mankind needs to describe Steve's life in just one line, I think that  we'll need just a couple of words: "Think Different"
You will always be the most creative person in the world R.I.P prayers go out to the family&nbsp;
Even my 10 yr old cried.
I was fresh out of college and excited about the face of the future.  Steve was a visionary with an inspiration that changed my carrier from accounting to computers. Apple addressed all that I was interested in for my home computer needs.  It  made life with a computer at home so easy and intuitive. Thank you so much delivering on the promise of computers for everyone.  You will be remembered through the ages with the likes of Ford, Edison, Jefferson, Disney and even the Beatles.
Dear Jobs,  Smile, though your heart is aching Smile, even though it's breaking When there are clouds in the sky You'll get by...  If you smile with your fear and sorrow Smile and maybe tomorrow You'll find that life is still worthwhile if you'll just...  Light up your face with gladness Hide every trace of sadness Although a tear may be ever so near That's the time you must keep on trying  Smile, what's the use of crying You'll find that life is still worthwhile If you'll just...  Smile, though your heart is aching Smile, even though it's breaking When there are clouds in the sky You'll get by...  Bye..&nbsp;
Remembering Steve Jobs,  I would just like to say even though I did not get a chance to meet him,  he was truly a genius. I love Apple products and they would have never  become what they are today without him. My deepest sympathies in this hard time.  Rest In Peace, Steve Jobs
We are so sorry to hear of Steve's passing. He literally changed the way the entire world sees technology!  A trendsetter with a sharp mind to say the least, he will be greatly missed but his legacy will always live on through us and future generations. Rest in peace.
Steve didn't change my life. He changed the way i'm living it, by  shaping the way i'm interacting everyday with technology, and the  philosophy surrounding this relation. And also by proving that thinking  out of the box is the only way to touch people. Thanks Stevie. See you  there.  
Thank you Steve for your incredible contribution to modern society.  It  is hard to imagine the world we live in without the many elements that  your creativity and vision have helped shaped.  You will be forever  remembered as a man with a clear vision of the future.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  I just started using Apple for few years but then I realized that it's the best and I'm addicted to Apple products. I really love you Steve and regret to hear that we lost you. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Ever since I was a young designer some 30 years ago, Steve Jobs  redefined the possibilities of what we could achieve. His vision and gift for understanding how we as can exceed the human  boundaries and achieve was astounding to me. His clear prescient eye on the future denied any explanation.  Steve was a cultural icon in my life that was a constant inspiration and  source of hope. In pursuit of extremely humanistic approaches to technology, he  redefined for me the very way I thought about concept and design. And what it means to be human.  To be without his presence in our world is to have lost a man of near  mythical character, who's only challenge left unbeaten was our inherent  mortality.  I will feel this hole in my heart &amp; soul for some time, for a world  without Steve is ultimately less human.
I have lighted candle tonight by my iPhone, MacbookPro and iMac. As a graphic designer and web developer, Steve Jobs changed my life. I couldn't do what I do and I couldn't pursue my journey without his genius vision. He gave me all the tools I need to fulfill my mission. Can't thank him enough what he has done for the world. Thank You, Steve!!&nbsp;
Thanks Steve!  You changed the world! Now the world will not be the same. You're the greatest man in history. We will remember you forever!&nbsp;
Dear Mr. Jobs,  Maya Angelou once said, "I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." I'd like to establish the fact that I am thankful, blessed, and grateful to be able to have the gift that you have worked so hard to create for us. It's been absolutely my pleasure to be able to live during the Golden Era of the Apple franchise. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
I just want to say: "Thank you" for your amazing contribution to this technological world. Youv'e inspired me to become a better person  Sending my thoughts to your family and friends. 
I was speechles. I just entered the internet and the first thing I saw was Steve's picture and dates...God bless him...what a loss, I hope his legacy continues through his Apple teammates and new generation...thank you Steve for your vision, imagination and dreams...you are a great example of what human potential is capable of and the power of creation... 
I will pray for you and your family during this incredible time of loss to the world.  You are a genius in every sense of the word, and your vision and passion has inspired a generation.&nbsp;
Our biggest condolences to him wife and children's. &nbsp;Steve Jobs will be in the world mind forever.
My sympathy to Steve's friends &amp; family.  No way for me to know Steve the man, I've just marveled and bought many, many Apple products over the years. I do know my tech world will never be the same.   Thanks Steve, it was a wild ride.   RIP.
 Steve Jobs had changed the world and he will never ever be forgotten R.I.P. Steve Jobs.
My father introduced our family to Apple in 1980, and it was love at first sight for my dad, and for me. To this day, Frogger is my favorite computer game, and I can't imagine my office without a Mac computer (2, actually). It also contains an ipad, an ipod nano, an ipod touch, and an iphone; thanks to Mr. Jobs, I have been hooked on Apple since 1980. Steve's vision, brilliance &amp; hard work changed the world for the good, and it will never be the same without him. It's hard to imagine the creative world without Steve Jobs in it, but the show will go on, and his effect on it will always remain.  R.I.P. Steve Jobs; blessings to your family &amp; the company you leave behind. We will miss you:(.
The ease of operating a Mac, and the philosophy of Steve Jobs and Apple, has made a believer out of me.  He was born the same year as me, but he was light years ahead.  Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
You have changed the way we live, work and play and have opened our eyes to an era of gadgets that I could only dream of when I was a kid.  Thank you.
We have lost one of the greatest visionaries of the world...   Truly a  legend for the ages who changed the world in the same way as Thomas  Edison, Henry Ford and others.
I am sad today, but happy for all that you have brought to the world. 
Dear Steve,   You were an inspiration to an entire generation of kids and entrepreneurs. I'm having trouble putting the sadness I'm feeling upon your loss, to words. May the world produce more sons like you to fill the void that's now left by your absence. The 'dent' that you've left on the universe will be forever felt by the future generations. May we continue in your footsteps and innovate, and make the world a better place.  Rest in peace.
Mr Jobs was not only a man, not only a husband but he was a gift.   A genius who took an almost bankrupt company to the heavens and now god will shine on all his children--all Apple users.   Steve you are a fighter, you fought to hard and now it is time to rest.    Sleep good Steve because the world sheds it tears for you.
Steve,  Thank you Steve for changing my life with amazing products, making my  life easier and most of all fun.  You changed how we listen to music,  make phone calls, communicate with each other, and access information.   You made life interesting and fun and gave us what we wanted.  You are a  brilliant man.  You will live on in our thoughts and prayers and we will never forget  you.  God Bless
I can't believe it.  I just logged in and saw Steve Jobs' picture and   the date on the Apple home page.  I was confused at first because I   hadn't heard anything on the news.  Then I clicked on the picture and   I am saddened to learn of his passing.  I love my Apple products and I   will miss Mr. Jobs and his amazing inventions of the future.
Steve Jobs changed the world.  R.I.P Steve Jobs. 
Someone who has changed how we think and our world. Someone so special will never be forgotten.
The man Steve Jobs was such a technical guru and innovator, but at the same time evolving many industries and cementing  his place in society! My condolences to his family and all the Apple family that he led to a level  and standard of greatness, thus leaving a legacy for the world!
I'm only 13, but I considered Steve a role model and I hope he rests in  peace.  He was the smartest and most innovative man the world has ever  seen.  He may be gone, but his ideas and products will remain in the  world forever.
Steve: I can't believe you died, I'm shocked. May you rest in peace. My  thoughts go to your family and friends. You will be missed!
Dear Steve Jobs,  I wanted to thank you for helping us realize what we can do, as people, that we are limitless to our visions. You've achieved what no one has done before, leading a company not by greed, but by visions. And so I, wholeheartedly, thank you for the amazing products, and all of your dreams that has unlocked the portal to the future.  The digital age revolution has begun... but not without you, Steve Jobs.
I cannot think about loosing such an inventor. Mr.  Jobs has given so many young people, like myself a role model to look up  to. In his remembrance just as a thought, Apple could launch an iJob or  an iSteve in remembrance of the visionary genius that created the  MacGeneration. The iJob or iSteve could be the next iPad or iPhone,  please Apple, create something amazing as you always do, but name it  after your inventor, our role model, Steve Jobs.  Please do not dwell on the sadness of this day, instead think of all of  the magic he has given to my generation. He has created something  amazing, indescribable, a generation where we get it, where we want to  invent, to explore, he is us, he is our forefather of the MacGeneration.&nbsp;
Steve will be forever remembered. Thank you Steve and apple! 
What an incredible loss!
You inspired many of us! RIP
A true visionary. The world is a better place because of you. Thank you Steve Jobs, rest in peace.
 As a fan of Apple since the very beginning, someone who talks and promotes Apple products to friends and family members and virtually anyone who listens, as someone who listens to every keynote and then watches it again, I have come to admire the man in a way that is most uncommon. That someone could run such a huge company, and run it so well, and not only take Apple to new ideas and places through it's products, but the world and the culture along for the  ride, leaves me awestruck when I stop to think of it. In his own simple and exceptional way, he was a great man. And I will miss seeing him.
Dear Steve, You are the legend. I loved seeing you giving presentations. It is just  so inspiring, not only the IT stuff, but also your persistence and hard  work. You have changed my life. Thanks  RIP Steve. Will always remember you.
All he wanted to do was innovate. All he wanted to do was blow people  away by showing them what humanity could accomplish. He never looked  back. He was never ashamed. He constantly looked forward. All he wanted  to do was to put a ding in the Universe. He did it. I'm only 16, but I  can assure you that he would want us to continue to look forward. He'd  want us to start building the next big thing tomorrow. Always, Tomorrow.
for all he did, for his vision. He will be missed and always remembered.  A very sad day.&nbsp;
To the Jobs, and Apple families,  Today I was deeply saddened by the news that Steve Jobs had passed away. I never met Steve but he was, and will always be an important part of my life. I supported a family and raised four children working as an artist in front of my Mac. Over the years I have kept my cherished family photos with iPhoto, wrote love songs with GarageBand, captured precious moments in time with iMovie, and listened to countless hours of inspiring music with iTunes. And now that my children have grown and make their way in the world, I wish them well, and tell them how much I love them via text on my iPhone. Without Steve's vision none of this would have been possible, and for that I am eternally grateful. To a man who has given me so much over the years I have one word, iPeace.  My heartfelt condolences to Steve's immediate and extended families. 
My deepest condolences to his family!  (I know first hand how cancer affects those you love.)  We will never forget Steve Jobs, his spirit and vision!  As said so perfectly,  "…and his spirit will forever be the foundation of Apple."   Thank you, Steve, you will be missed!
Steve, you always be my inspiration . . .  You go so fast, the world need you . . .  But eveything is beautiful in His time . . .  Good bye, Steve Job&nbsp;
Steve was my idol, I don't know what I can do without him.
Bye bye Steve Jobs. Thank You for all.
May his soul rest in peace. my heart goes out to his family and close friends. Not only was he a genius, but touched everyone of our lives by what he knew to do best make technological gadgets in which have changed our lives .&nbsp;
My sincerest condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues who knew Steve Jobs. His brilliance will be missed. a very sad day for the world.
Thanks for everything you've shared with us, We will miss you STEVE JOBS. 
I was born into a generation that could not have dared to Einstein, Freud, Da Vinci, Newton, Galileo, Darwin, among others, is proud to say that I saw and experienced the era of agreat genius. Steve Jobs leaves gallery "talented men who changed history" to become a myth. Thank you for the honor of being proud of my time.  A bitten apple will never have the same meaning.&nbsp;
To Whom It May Concern,  I just turned on my computer and it went to Apple Page, I had to take a double  take to see if what I was reading was actually true. While I never knew Steve, I  would say that I felt like I did, I have been a Apple, customer, ever since the  Apple was all in a cube. I am so sorry that this has happened as he was such a  great ambassador for who he was and the product he built,   to say he did a  great job would be a understatement, he was and always will be a inventor, and a  genus in what Apple has become today.  Take for example the First Iphone, and the Ipad,  even when a lot of hard  working people at Apple had a lot to do with it, It would of never been what it  was without Steve and the amazing job, that he did at the press conference his  word, his body language his demonstration, and the love for those new innovation  was heartfelt, I believe that beside the new Apple store, popping out in every  city, this name and product will hopefully continue to be what it is and what it  was, I am sorry that such a great person that I never met has left all of us.   "Steve you were and always will be a huge role model for anyone that believe in  there company and product."
God bless him and may he rest in peace.
He was by far the greatist inspiration for business.  We should all Listen and Learn from him.
I have only Steve and the Apple team to thank for so many wonderful products.I have had an Ipod for most of my life! My condolences for his family and friends. A visionary is gone, but through him ideas will be born anew.   Godspeed Steve. Rest in Peace. 
Thank you for everything!! 
We will miss you...the world is a little less bright today with the news  of your death.  You have revolutionized the world for better. Rest in  Peace and may God Bless you and your family always.
The IPhone changed my life.
I have been an Apple fan since 1984. Watching Steve's rise, fall and greater rise was wondrous. Even Steve's failures were simply too far ahead of their time. His attention to detail, elegance, quality and the aesthetic have been greatly appreciated.  It is with great sadness and grief that we mark Steve's passing. I offer my sincere condolences to Steve's family and friends.  The world has lost a visionary genius.&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs. Thank you for all the formidable things you gave me, from my  first Apple II computer to the iPad 2 that I am using to write this message ... And thank you for everything else that is still to come and that will make me wonder "how did I ever live without this?"  GENIUSES LEAVE LEGACIES THAT CHANGE OUR EVERYDAY LIVES AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID!  Thank you
The word "genius" is inadequate to describe Mr. Jobs.  I am sorry for us.  We needed his vision.&nbsp;
I will always remember Steve, everytime I look at my iPhone. God bless his soul.
Steve will be remembered beside Einstein, Pasteur and Newton. The world is moving toward his creations. I am very sorry for your loss.&nbsp;
So sad to say goodbye to someone who has changed our lives so much.  I   first came to know Apple products as a school teacher, and purchased   my first home computer when the iMac was introduced.  With each new   Apple product, Steve Jobs made the world more accessible, more   fascinating, and full of creative possibilities for all of us. His   unique vision and drive made us want to know more not only about his   products, but about him as well.   One can only wonder what more he   had in store for us had he lived longer.  A light goes out tonight, but it's glow remains with us and will for   years to come.   
Since I was a kid in awe of my Apple products, I dreamed of the day I would meet the genies behind it all. I was a great admirer for your passion for hard work and creativity. In many ways, you have forever changed the world for the better. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. Minds like you don't come often. 
I send my condolences to his family . Stay strong stay focused and remember him as an innovator that changed how we use computers! I remember when the iPod came to the market. It changed the world, music, everything it was a ground breaker! The Apple family and Steve continued to change how to we use computers even until his last day! May god rest his soul and he'll always be remembered ! R.I.P MR APPLE (steve jobs). 
Steve Jobs - a legend in his own time. Rest in peace, as the world will only be better by your very existence and your visionary implementation. The world has truly lost a great member. 
I felt doubts about leaving PC utilities  and jump into Mac. Your speech at Stanford University was definitive, even it is not  related with hardware or software decision, it was the reason why I join Apple  world.  I'm feeling so sad to see you leaving. I want to believe that I knew you  through Apple products. My condolences to your family and all the people that loves you.
Steve Jobs is a name that needs no explanation. He is one of few in which people hear his name and already know what to expect. He was an amazing person. And as an Apple employee I am grateful for what he has done.
His genius, contribution, and vision transformed the way my family uses technology to live a more efficient lifestyle. I am glad to say that I lived in the time of the most inspiring 21st century visionary to date. His legacy will stand the test of time. Thank you and God bless.    Yours,    A very saddened iPhone, iPad, MacBook, &amp; iMac user&nbsp; 
 So very sorry to hear he's gone. A very important man who revolutionized  the digital world.  Our  deepest condolences to his family.  He will be  missed but he is in a better place, and in peace.
I truly believe that Apple has changed the way technology is used in the world as we know it, and I think that a lot of the sweat and grit that went into that from the beginning was Steve's. Thank you all for making Apple what it is today, and thank you Steve for pushing the company to break-out from the limits. I speak for the entire world when I say that we'll miss you.
Dear Apple Team, Steve Jobs' Family, Friends and Co-Workers,  I was so upset to hear that the creative genius had died. He was the Einstein of our time, inventing all new things, from iPods, to iPads, to Macs, he was just an amazing individual. I would like to send my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and co-workers, and I would like to say, Steve Jobs was a fantastic man.  Thank you&nbsp;
Jus wanna send my condolences to Apple and the Jobs family for their loss. Steve was my role model and I'll miss him.&nbsp;
Thank you for everything you have done for the world. &nbsp;You created the first interface that showed icons in the world. &nbsp;Without that, the world wouldn't be the same. &nbsp;Without you the world wouldn't be the same. &nbsp;Thank you for all the inventions you have created. &nbsp;You weren't just a great inventor, you were a great person. &nbsp;R.I.P Steve Jobs.... My heart goes out to your family and friends and you!!&nbsp;
He shaped and influenced much of my perception of what living in our time came to mean; he defined what what corporate America should strive for. I will miss him greatly.&nbsp;
RIP Steve  You invented the future as we know it.  Things will never be the same.  Thanks for sharing your vision with us.
My first apple product was an ipod video I purchased (and still use) in  2006. Steve's innovative spirit and passion for excellence kept me  coming back for more. My prayers today are for his family and those  close to him. Thanks Steve, my life is much better because of you. You  will be missed!&nbsp;
Words cannot express the magnitude of this loss. My prayers and  condolences go out to his family, friends and co-workers. The world has  indeed lost a remarkable human being. 
Mr. Jobs changed the way I looked at technology, he opened my eyes to what could be. Thanks Steve, you changed the world.&nbsp;
I am an Apple fan, and once an employee at Apple retail. Working at Apple was one of the greatest experiences of my life. It changed and shaped me to become a better individual in society, and professionally. Send my regards to the Jobs family, it's a very emotional time for everyone.
My heart goes out to Steve's family and friends; I can only imagine that  a man as dynamic as he would have impacted those immediately around him  in profound ways.  Thank you for your amazing contributions to the betterment of our lives,  Steve.&nbsp;With much love &amp; reverence!
With his candle burnt out, the world will seems dimmer without him. He was a truly remarkable man that I never knew personally but I always looked up to as visionary and great leader. He inspired me as child and fascinated me with his ideas through his products from computers to iPods to iPhones and iPads. His candle burned twice as bright as any man and will definitely leave a mark on mankind for generations to come and I am glad and honored to say I lived and experienced his innovations first hand. God bless you in your time of mourning.
I think the "Think Different" advertisement described Mr. Jobs to  perfection. &nbsp;
For those of us who aren't tech savvy people, Steve Jobs made you feel the products he spoke of could easily put you in a place of technologically comfort. Steve Jobs is the Muhammed Ali of tech. I say "is" because although he is no longer with us, others will forever play catch-up to the genius that was, Steve Jobs.
If there is one word that describes Steve Jobs, its inspiring. He will always be seen as an inspiring genius in my mind. Rest in peace Steve Jobs, the world will miss you so very much.   
I was never blessed to meet Steve personally, but watching him on stage  i could feel it, his amazing presence he had that affected EVERYONE he  stood in front of. It was him doing what he loved that lit up the stage.  I really missed this presence during the last apple conference and i  know i was not alone in that feeling. But i take peace in knowing that  he was with his family. He was so young and i am praying for peace to  his wife and family in this time of need. I know apple will NEVER be the  same, but i also know that all who remain have the same love for apple  that Steve did, and therefore Steve's touch will be on every future  product we see from apple. I will miss him and am so sad at this news  today! God bless the family and close friends.&nbsp;
A Visionary that will never be forgotten.  He simply changed the world  and carried us to the future and beyond. 
Merci, et que la ou tu soit, tu soit entouré de matériel afin de f ournir une technologie de malade aux émissaires du paradis. Condoléance pour ta famille, tes amis, et tes fans. Merci Mr Jobs.
As I sit here on my Mac with my iPhone by my side, my thoughts and prayers go out to Steve's family, friends and colleagues. The world has truly become a better place because of a man named Steve Jobs. I, for one, will always be grateful for everything that he has brought into my life. God bless him and may he rest in peace. &nbsp;
&nbsp;As a child, dreamed of having an Apple product, products, beautiful and easy to use, who created the great genius Steve Jobs,  today I have an iPhone, iPad among other Apple products that were created by the brilliant mind of Steve Jobs. Today we lost a brilliant a mind, the more I'm sure now he is with God our Lord and Savior, he is now in the arms of the Father.  May God be with Steve Jobs  Hugs from a big fan and user of great products that you created.             
Adieux M. Jobs et merci pour pour celui que vous avez ete.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to all who know Steve. I didn't, yet he was a an inspiration for me. Rest in peace, Steve, you won our hearts. 
Dear friends and family of Steve Jobs:  My thoughts go out to you during this difficult time. The world has lost  a creative genius today. I have been a fan of the Apple brand for many years because of Steve's amazing creativity and innovation. My first Apple product was the iPod Mini. I thought it was the greatest invention of the world and nothing else could ever  top that. Then just a few years later, the iPhone came, which I feel it will become one of the most revolutionary new products of the 21st century. And  we owe it all to Steve Jobs and the amazing team at Apple.  Today, I feel I've lost a friend. But the world must go on and I look forward to the technology and innovation Apple will bring us in the future.
Steve is my hero :( love his positive energy and creativity.  Sent from my iPhone...thanks to Steve :) 
About fifteen minutes ago I saw that we've lost a genius..a man that was capable to change the world.It's not a surprise for us, professionals (and future professionals, like me) in the IT field feel a REALLY enormous hole in our lives. This message i'm leaving here isn't nothing more than a wish, and my wish is: Rest in an eternal and marvelous peace, Steven Paul Jobs. God bless all our families.            
The world will miss Steve Jobs forever.  He was so much in our lives that this loss feels like as a personal loss.   He laid the path for people to think differently and not just within Apple but all over the world.&nbsp;Steve Jobs changed our lives.  He will be remembered for centuries to come and I feel privileged to have lived in his era.&nbsp;I pray for his family  and hope God gives them strength.  For Apple, I hope it creates the future which Steve Jobs imagined.
I can't believe that Steve Jobs is gone. He was clearly the most   innovative person in the computer industry. A visionary, a genius, and   a one of a kind person who has changed the world. 
Mr. Jobs will be missed. My sincerest condolences to all he leaves behind.  The Apple II was the first Apple machine that I every used and learned on. Now, I use the MacBook Pro some 20+ years later.  What a visionary, what a genius, what an amazing man, what a legacy,  and what a fighter. The world weeps today.  I am not good with words but, thought I just had to say what a great loss the universe experienced today.  Thank you Steve Jobs, Thank you.
    R.I.P Steve, cannot forget about all your contribution to Apple, and even the technology. Your spirit will be last FOREVER!!!&nbsp;
Dear Madam/Sir,     It is my strongest belief that there are  no proper words that can offer relief  to a person when they lose someone  they love. I lost my dear father when  I was 25 years old, so, I know the  feeling.     However, I strongly believe that the  person who passed away would not  want to cause sorrow to those he   left behind. Sadness may bring  down a person's imagination and  creativity. But that is not something  that Steve Jobs would want, neither  for his family, nor for his company's   personnel.!     A true visionary, a true computer  genius, a man with his original approach  to thinking. Even though I never got  the chance to meet him in person, I   know some things about him through  his creations. His last speech in the  commencement at Stanford was a   revelation.      I offer my condolences to his family,  and wish them the best for their  future. May God rest his soul.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs, &nbsp;Being 17 I don't know to much about life yet. One thing that i do know   was you. Not that I don't know you personally, but the fact that I   know of you and a lot about you.  I know you have changed and impacted   my life so much. You changed everyones life with the creation of   Apple. You changed a generation alone that could not have turn out to   what it is today without you. So for that I thank you. Everyone thanks   you. So may you be remembered throughout history as the greatest   inventor alive for this generation and for those to come. I wish the   best for you and those that know you personally and that they live a   happy life. So may you rest in peace and be remembered throughout time   and history as one of the greatest people of all time.
 My prayers go out to his family and his innovation and spirit will be missed.&nbsp;
I bought a Mac in London in 1984.  128k RAM.  No hard drive.  I still have it.  It still works.  Dot matrix printer.  I have been a Mac man ever since.  God bless you Steve Jobs, you have enriched my life.  Thank you so much.&nbsp;
To live in hearts we leave behind is not to die. - Thomas Campbell.<div><br></div><div>Thank you Steve....</div>
I have been a big Apple fan, and a big Steve Jobs fan, since the first Macintosh in 1980.  He was a visionary and will be missed.
The world has lost a brilliant mind and a great human being.   Love and best wishes to Laurene and the children and all his friends and colleagues at Apple.
To the Jobs and entire Apple family:  I would like to express my deepest condolences on the passing of Steve Jobs. He changed the world with his vision and determination and the world will never, ever be the same.  Wishing you all peace and comfort during this very difficult time.&nbsp;
I'm sad to hear of Steve Jobs' death. He was the kind of person that new  how to understand the needs of many people, through his products and  company. I can only hope his vision is continued on by those he's left  behind. Thank you very much for what you've given all of us in the form of a  simple device that's changed the way we communicate and do our daily  activities with.&nbsp;
You are still an inspiration for all of us.
I am sad tonight.. Sad that I heard Steve Jobs has died... It was 1994 and I bought my first Mac. When I bought it there was NO ONE around in my area that had one and I had to teach myself. I bought a Blueberry SE, and just loved it. I bought the lap top that looked like a make up mirror,I bought another SE, I bought three Mac book pros.. Have two ipads, two iphones, and  So yup, I am ad always have been a MAC girl. Steve Jobs was the one that got me to want a Mac, despite how the PC people would try to persuade me that a Mac is not a good thing. I wish Steve well where he is and I am sure he has happy and  healthy and thinking up somoe wonderful new Mac ideas.&nbsp;
 Steve we all love you and you will never be forgotten. Not only have you made  the best products but you made us better people.&nbsp;
 I got my first Mac in 1986.  I've been sneered at, then grudgingly acknowledged, and now it's fashionable. Thank you Steve for keeping your vision, and keeping your believers grateful to be "users" long enough to be vindicated in myriad ways. Your strength and determination, even in the face of unthinkable health challenges, leaves me for one eternally in awe.
Although I haven't purchased much from the Apple company, when I heard of Steve Jobs' passing, it hit me that the world had truly lost a brilliant man. What we haven't lost, though, is his story, his strong will to keep fighting, and a legacy that will surely live on. Steve Jobs has made history and has left his footprint on the world. RIP, and my sincerest condolences to Mr. Jobs' family.
The world is a more magical place because he was here.  He is comparable to Edison, Ford and Einstein in his impact on our lives.  Am profoundly saddened that he will not grace our planet again.&nbsp;
It is a very sad day for all of us who believe in the free creative spirit and individuality. you will be deeply missed steve.
Thank you for me, for us, for the world.
I always had and will have a lot of respect for Steve Job. I found a lot  of inspiration on this man. I used him as a reference and example for  different situations in my life. Shortly, what a lost, what a man, what a human being, what a  professional and lovely person.  He will be present in each apple around this world  Thank you for the opportunity.&nbsp;
For family and one of my biggest idols ...   Go in peace, you left a great legacy to humanity, who not only revolutionized the IT, but showed to all that simple and innovative attitudes are still the best weapons of creativity!   Thank you, the size of Brazil!
Rest in peace, Steve  Proud as hell to be writing this in apple mail on a macbook that is running lion. Your message about the future inspires me to aspire to something that i love.&nbsp;
Our heartfelt condolences reaches out to all those who are left behind by this great man - Steve Jobs. Forever your memories are etched on the better lives you''ve could have only created. 
The power of computing has made life better for so many people and you gave it to us. You've changed our lives and we will never forget you.
I went into engineering because of Steve Jobs.   He was a genius and I  wanted so much to be just like him.  I learned later that the point of  his genius was to think for yourself -- that was one of the best gifts  anyone has ever given me.  I pray Steve is at peace.  Thank you Apple for your amazing products.   Please don't let Steve's  memory fade. 
To say that Steve inspired me would be an understatement. I respected his pursuit of the new. The way he spoke about new product releases at Apple affirmed his passion and belief in each and every product, and easily made me a believer. Each keynote he gave, I downloaded and watched as if it were destination television. Each product release drew my husband and I to our local Apple Store, knowing something transformational - and even a little bit magical - surely awaited us. We were never disappointed.  Because of Steve, I came to truly believe that passion, drive and natural curiosity could take you further in life than any degree from any school you might attend. That working a retail job could be fulfilling and like no other retail job I'd ever had before. Steve taught me the power of simplicity.  My life will forever be changed because I knew of Steve Jobs. His work changed the world. His words changed how I live in it.&nbsp;
I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;the the first Apple desktop.&nbsp; I remember the first Apple Mac. I remember the first Newton.  I will&nbsp;remember&nbsp;Steve's creativity and vision May he rest in peace. May his dreams live on.  Farewell.
We Missed the greatest human being, an icon, an inspiration, to millions of people on this earth....Rest in Peace...
 I personally never used a mac or any Apple product in all honesty.  But we (The World) just lost a great Pioneer/innovator of the Digital Age.  Steve Jobs you will be missed by both Mac and Windows Users alike.  Today may be a dark day for both the Digital Age and Apple with the loss  of Steve Jobs. However Apple's Future is a bright beacon for the world to see; a crowning  achievement of Steve Jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Steve Jobs you will be missed. Even though I have never met you. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
 Sad because he is not here any more.  But happy about the time we shared together in This world  My condolence to his family and To all the apple world  
Steve - Thank You for being the creative and inspiring man that you were. You have made so very many people happier as a result of your creativity.&nbsp;
What a terrible loss. Steve was always an inspiration to me personally,  an icon. He built a great company, drove the development of several  great products, changed the face of computing as well as mobile and will  definitely go down in history as an innovator of our time. Even after  losing his company, he continued to succeed and once he regained Apple  made it stronger than ever. I only wish I had the opportunity to meet  him.
You showed us that we always have to fight to the very end!  I will never forget that lesson.
The world loses the most important visionary of this century. Someone that modern history will never forget. After Steve Jobs, people will never forget about what inspiration means.
Today is a sad day, a great visionary who has brought nothing but good to the world has passed away. I together  with countless others who dreamed of meeting Steve but never came closer than the historical keynotes and interviews will remember this great man who will be remembered indefinitely.  My thoughts go out to all apple employees and Steves family.
Please accept my condolences for the passing of Mr. Jobs.  He was a great man with great ideas.  He will dearly be missed not only by those who knew him, but all of us who have benefit from never ending inspiration.
Some people say Steve Jobs was the Thomas Edison of our time, but Steve was the Steve Jobs of our times. From a public standpoint, all good things have been and will be said about him for a long time to come. Even though I’m just another fan of his work and the company he created, I now realize how personal my gratitude towards Steve is. He brought pride through innovation for the San Francisco Bay Area, especially Silicon Valley, and in some indirect form, he helped me earn a living through his employees  purchasing the consumer durables I sold a few years ago close to the Apple campus. Lastly, I fondly remember  when I’d go home after work and drove on Interstate 280 North, stuck in traffic, and looking at Apple’s main building giant ad poster, which would show pictures of some of the best innovators of our time. Well, next time I drive through there, I expect to see Steve’s picture there.&nbsp;
 I can't believe this. God is jealous of your talent. I was thinking about the meaning of your world, " Keep looking, don't settle" last night, but today………….  You are the legend of this century, your story have beeing inspired thoughts and thoughts heart and the arts you made have beening changed all the world. Being well in the heaven. People will never forget you. You are living our hearts, forever.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. We will always remember you.
God gave you the gift of making people happy. Hundreds of millions of them. I like to think he will give you the means to continue doing it from up there, in many different, unknown ways.  Thank you Steve.
So sorry to hear of Mr. Job's passing.  He was a brilliant and very   clever man.   From the little of him that I know about, it seems that he lived life   to the fullest.
Having bought one of the first Apple II+ computers in the late 70's I can say we lost the greatest mind of my generation. Steve you made my life better and a whole lot more fun. Rest in peace and may God give your family the strength needed to continue celebrating your life.&nbsp;
RIP Steve, and thank you for making such an amazing company, and a awesome Phone such the Iphone and the Ipad, you will be missed, you are in a better Place and resting no more suffering,  thank you RIP.
Thanks for building such an incredible company, full of innovations, technology, and great people. I hope to work for Apple some day and keep your vision alive. Forever live Apple.&nbsp;
Thank you for everything you have created.  It is truly a loss.&nbsp;
I just bought my first iMac computer. I love Apple products and think they are absolutely amazing. As Jacque Fresco of The Venus Project states "all technology is just a pile of junk, unless it truly helps humans live a better life" I truly felt that with Steve Jobs' incredibly innovative insight Apple was and is the only electronics company that made hardware that indeed, improves the quality of life. From ceo's to people with disabilities using the multi-touch programming on the iPad, the multi-touch gestures and universal access for disabled people. It turned there products into almost, "one size fits all" hardware devices. Steve Jobs was truly a design genius, and will be sorely missed in this ever advancing technological world.
Actually I'm shocked by this news and I thought it must be kidding at the first place. I have a pad on my hand, I use it to see this news and I feel deeply sad about that. But Steve Jobs cannot die, we all own one of his Horcruxes, ipad, iphone, itouch...We will never forget him !!!!!!!
Thank you for what you have done for families. My family loves our own playlist that we have on my iPod Touch. When we are together I pick the playlist that we are going to listen to an it is like that person won. Just alittle game we play. Love your products!!  Love APPLE!!!
There will be few others who can be as much an inspiration as Steve for those who wish to realize their dreams. 
Dear Jobs Family and Apple Family,  Our hearts and prayers go out to all of you.  Even if I do not know Mr.  Steve Jobs personally, I believe that he is a great and kind human  being.  May you find comfort, peace, and healing in this hard time.  We  pray for Mr. Steve Jobs; may he rest in peace.&nbsp;
In 2007, I left my corporate job of 15 years to pursue my dream because: 1) I had an Apple computer that allowed me to work from anywhere and 2) because of this quote by Steve Jobs: &nbsp;“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.” Thank you, Mr. Jobs. Thank you so much.
Steve Jobs was a great visionary. He created a company and took it further than anybody else could have. I was ten when the&nbsp;iPhone&nbsp;came out, and&nbsp;even&nbsp;then I was fascinated by the thing. The&nbsp;iPod Touch came soon after, and my family scraped together enough money for one. As time passed, the ties to my life deepened as I began to use Mac computers, fiddle around on the iOS devices, and learn more about the wonderful world of apple. I&nbsp;received&nbsp;the newest iPod Touch over the summer as a graduation gift, after begging my parents and constantly using our old and outdated model. I now use it for most of my fun, work, and everything in between. The way Steve Jobs touched my life was not by making me buy a product, but allowing me access to a wide world of technology. I now design games and try to learn as much as I can from the visionary teachings of Steve Jobs.  R.I.P. STEVE JOBS
   Death of Steve Jobs is a loss for humanity.  May his soul rest in peace.     God Bless!
What an amazing,  wonderful and extraordinary human being.  He kept his  spirits high and used his God given talents to the highest of standards.   I pray that those who were fortunate to work with him and know him will  continue to work and love in the same way Steve did.  God bless his  family for all the years they shared him with the world. 
Not too many people can be distinguished with the honor of truly changing the world, but I think Steve Jobs is definitely someone who has done just that. No one brand name that I have seen in my short lifetime has been as innovative as Apple products. Steve was synonymous with the overall excellence of his company. He is a legendary inventor and a true visionary. Technology took such a big leap forward thanks to Steve's unparalleled innovations. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family. RIP Steve Jobs.
To  Apple Inc and The Family Of Mr Steve Jobs. My Deepest Condolences to your Family.  My God continue to keep and  protect you during this difficult time.     Mr Jobs will be missed  :-(&nbsp;
 Good Bye Steve, I never knew you very well, but I did enjoy your products, you will not be forgotten thanks.  :)            
Im from Argentina, and in university, Steve is always there, teachers  and professors are always talking about him, he was awesome. I also like my Apple stuff so much, my MacBook Air, my iPhone, my iPad  2, they have changed my life, and the lives of million of people around  the world. I will miss him so much, he always knew what to say. You cant imagine  how sad people are in South America too. RIP Steve, I just hope you can still lead Apple from wherever you are  now.  "Stay hungry, Stay foolish" 
Steve, thank you for all. RIP
Well although i never met him, he came onto this earth, created his own  market of technology. Even though you are just in our thoughts and  dreams, you will always be in our hearts as the one to give us Apple. He  was a great man, and my number one dream, was to meet this man, and even  work side by side with him. although my dream never came true, I'm sure  you could make it "just work" 
I am saddened to hear of Steve's passing.  I am grateful for his vision  and creative genius. He has truly left a mark in this world for the  better.  Thank you Steve for making my life and business run easier with  your brilliant inventions.  You will be missed.
He is my inspiration.  Bye bye Steve. God be with you.
Truly an icon in technology. He will always be THE Steve Jobs.
Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. I am one of the millions of people who owe you an enormous debt for literally creating a new world - one where we could work, create, design, make art, learn, listen, talk, live, in an entirely new way. Your work allowed intelligence to become cool again. Your beautiful little machines unlocked ideas, lives, universes. Your vision unleashed a creative army. The world will never be the same. I am forever in your debt. I mourn your passing.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  sorry for my English, but I want to write because I feel sorry for your death. The staff that you have forged says just saying that "Apple loses a mentor but above all a dear friend". All of us, Apple customers and not, lose a great person. That empty chair at the keynote was given to you, but now you look around from there. Apple is more than just a company. Is something magical: is your inspiration. And that no one ever will remove that.  Thanks Steve for being the brilliant person who has made ​​life easier for millions of people.   A big hug. 
Hello,                        Today morning, i woke up and was going through the iPhone news channels. Boom came across this news. Really saddened by it and its really hard to believe. May Steve rest in peace. Looks like he was suffering from the said disease badly. Gods will is Gods will. He made a empire in a matter of few years and made people to believe in what he made, full of fun, creativity. Hats off to him. I am and was a great fan of him and his products since childhood and always follow what he has done and what he wants to do next.  Once again thanks a ton Steve and god bless you.
Rest in peace with your God. You have changed me, my family, and the world. 
Thank you very much for incredible innovation. RIP.
Today we've lost a valued member of society that had the brilliance and forthright to create what we could have never imagined. Thank you for inspiring us all and keeping us on the edge of our seats in anticipation of what was to  come next.
Dear Steve,   You've changed my life and you'll always be in my heart.&nbsp;
Rest in peace, genius.  Thank you for all the innovation and inspiration  you brought to us!&nbsp;
Farewell Steve, your company has changed my life for ever. You will be missed
You left at the same age as my father, both of you went too young, both of you were an inspiration. Having had the wonderful opportunity of working for Apple, I know what a great and inspirational organisation you founded. I use Apple products everyday. I too, hope I can make the world a better place as well.  Thank you.&nbsp;
If it weren't for Steve's vision and aesthetic, my life would have so much less beauty, music and connections. What he and his partners throughout the years have created has enriched my and my family's lives tremendously. Thank you.
He built our world as we know it today. The life we live is shaped by   his dreams. I will always be thankful for that.
The most amazing person has died today. He left a legacy like no other, his memory will live on through his products, ideas and company. He was a revolutionary, a visionary, a man of the future. Each of us should try to learn his ways, for they apply not only in business but in life as well.   He may be gone but he will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
Good night.     Since Iphone was invented I learned to admire Steve Jobs.  I'm sure that invention changed our lives and IT history.     I'm very sad because the world lost a genius.     God stayed with him.      Good luck Jobs, mission accomplished!&nbsp;
We are deeply moved and mourn Steve's loss. Just touched that we don't have words. As I write this email, my wife is heartbroken, while I hold my tears back and my head cant think clearly. We don't&nbsp; know how we will break this news to our 8 year son who was aghast when he learnt that Steve is unwell with cancer.  We used Apple products at home but seemed so close to Apple and Steve in particular. Steve was a great innovator, thinker, leader, presenter. We wish well to the Apple employees, management to ride this tough time. Although a creative genius is gone, we are sure Apple will rise above this huge loss. As Steve said, "Stay hungry, Stay Foolish".   May Steve's great soul rest in peace.  You will be in our hearts till we turn to ashes.
The whole world mourns the sad loss. We have lost an icon, a visionary, a true inventor ... But we remember him for his great legacy, tracing the path left for future generations.&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs, Thank you for giving us all these wonderful gadgets - Ipads, Iphones, Imac. I can't imagine how my life would be  without them. You have left behind a great story to tell for our future generation. Thank you and rest in peace.
Thank you Steve for all the innovativeness that you brought into my life. Thank you for the amazing products you and Apple created. Thank you for all the inspiring keynotes you hosted and for your unbeatable spirit.  Rest in peace Great Visionary.
Everybody in the world loves you, and your amazing job! Thanks for revolutionize the technology for us! Everybody will miss you MAN! GOD IS WITH YOU, rest in peace!&nbsp;
Thanks Steve...You revolutionized the world,You revolutionized my world!!!... Rest in peace!!!...&nbsp;
I was very saddened by the news of the death of Steve Jobs. The world in April his eyes because of the work and vision of this great man, I deeply regret his death and that God will console his family and friends. My prayers for the family.
There's not a lot you can say.  Steve was a genius and just seemed to get what my age was looking for in technology.  Thank you Steve for your vision and guidance in technology.  The world has changed for the better because you were on it.
Lots of tears.... and sadness &amp; sympathy&nbsp;for his family and friends... and for the world. So much gratitude for his huge contribution to us all. Our hearts are heavy.&nbsp; Godspeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;
so i'm sitting here thinking "why am i so sad about the passing of someone i never knew?"  here's the answer:  steve jobs deeply touched all aspects of my life- professional, creative, personal, and otherwise. though it was inadvertent and i am but a single speck in the sea of similar stories, i feel genuine gratitude.  and loss.  thanks, man.&nbsp;
R.I.P. Steve Jobs. He is one of the reasons why I do what I do today.
Steve Jobs created the company that made every computer I ever owned, helped found the studio that made some of my favorite films and widely legitimized my field, donated hardware to every one of my public schools, and, indirectly, provided my mom with work for almost two decades. He was an awesome man, and he'll be greatly missed.&nbsp;
Dear Steve, and your brainchild Apple,  My message is gonna be simple and sweet, just like all of your inventions. I can still remembered the day when I navigated the internet for the first time from a screen with a rainbow-colored apple stamped on it. 1997 was the year when this ten-year-old girl saw the whole world opened up to her, all while sitting on the attic of her house in Jakarta, Indonesia. The experience was, of course, highly personal. And I think that is what your biggest invention is, Steve. You personalized your invention in a way no one could ever match - aint nothing like my love for my first Macbook.  One hell of a life, Steve. And I'm forever grateful.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  I would like to say thanks to you for all inspiration you created to make our live easier, better and more fun. May you got happiness up there to see the world you have created growing.  Good Bye.
I was so sad to hear the news this morning, that Steve had passed away. We have lost a truly great and talented man.  But as with truly great people has legacy, passion and vision will live for years to come.     My thought are with Steve's family.
To Steve,  I grew up with your innovations, I'm turning 20 tomorrow. I still remember the iPod launch in 2001 as much as I remember the iPhone, iPad and new iOS.  For the world, you changed quiet a few things: 1- Reinvented the PC with the Mac Book Air, new, faster, great design. 2- Reinvented the iPod through the years, from listening to music in 2001 to play with Apps in 2011. 3- Reinvented the Phone with the iPhone, iPhone 4S will surely come has the most successful phone to date. 4- Reinvented the Tablet, the amazingly made iPad 2. 5- My future in computer  I want to be a computer engineer, I would have been proud to meet you to build new softwares for Macs!  For Steve Jobs, rest in peace, and I hope I will be able to make a change in the technology world!&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs you are truly an amazing person. Thank you for contributing your vision to the world! You will be missed dearly...
Thanks for your vision and passion! Rest in peace Steve. Sorry for your loss to his family.&nbsp;
  I'm really sad about Steve's death. I love Apple products and ideas,  i use their products every day and I followed all Steve's videos  because he was unique. There are some few people in this world, who have  the ability to change the world. Steve was one of them.  I will never forget Steve, he is an idol to me. He taught me to love  technology and to be perfectionist. I admire all Steve's strength to fight against this treacherous  disease.  Finally, I hope you can rest in peace, you deserve it. Is a sad day to me. An important loss for the world.  Thanks to you, I will always THINK DIFFERENT!
I was just informed by my wife that my hero passed away....  My thoughts go to his family. He will always be remembered in my heart.  Thank you Steve for everything!!!&nbsp;
The world has lost a genius, an example of overcoming. Thank you for everything Steve Jobs, rest in peace. God bless your family and give strength to overcome this moment. Today is a sad day for the world.&nbsp;
Dear Steve and Apple,  You were a visionary man who created things that have changed the world.  If others can aspire to and become the spirited revolutionary person  that you were; our world will be a much better place.                   RIP Steve Love,                       The World 
I have had a Mac since my first 128Kb model in 1984. In all I have   done since that date I have used and promoted Apple. Steve Jobs   created a legacy of millions of devoted advocates who prided   themselves in being different because it made them better. Creative   professionals and imaginative individuals worldwide will keep the   spirit of Steve Jobs alive through their loyalty to his vision and   attitude otherwise known as Apple.&nbsp;
My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends.   What a great man we have lost.  The legacy he leaves behind is amazing.  Such a great mind and spirit to be taken so young.  Peace and blessings to all during this very difficult time.
Thanks for everything!! 
I wrote to Steve after his liver transplant wishing him well. I had a  liver transplant two years before him, I knew what he was going through.  He was larger than life.  Thanks for making this world a better and more fun place.&nbsp;
Good bye Steve, thanks for letting us dream.&nbsp;
I'm an avid fan of yours, Steve Jobs. You're the greatest inventor in the whole wide world, it's really a loss for us. I support Apple for the inventions that you made. Thank you for sharing it with us. Steve Jobs, as Apple lives we will never forget you. The man behind Apple. We know you're in good hands right now. You touched so many lives. Our condolences from the Philippines. You're a legend, Steve Jobs.
Today we journey forward in the eternal one of the greatest geniuses   of history, the work of Mr. Steve Jobs will be eternal, as eternal   our gratitude for all you bring to this world, as you wrote it, the   world lost a great human being, it is no dramatic to say that one: ..   the world was one before Steve Jobs .. and another after him ....   thanks for everything ... he rest in peace now, ....see you soon   Steve.!!!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an inspiration figure to me. Not only did he build an  empire he inspired the thoughts of everything I know about technology.  He was a mentor to me&nbsp;
I can't help but feel a great sense of loss after just hearing the terrible news of Steve's passing. My condolences to his family and friends.
Dear all,  We have lost  a wonderful and creative man who changed the life  of all  of us.  His intelligence led to wonderful things and we all now enjoy his  amazing pieces of art.  All of our gratitude and see you soon!!&nbsp;
He made me believe in a company that seem even magical in my eyes. &nbsp;I  feel the loss in my heart and I didn't even knew him. &nbsp;May God be with you,  you will be missed.
Steve Jobs was my inspiration for entering software development.  His genius  transcended generations and he innovations propelled Apple and the rest of computer industry to new horizons.  I never had the chance to meet the man I so highly looked up to, but he will be missed for years to come.  Goodbye, Steve Jobs.  Rest in peace sweet genius, rest in peace my mentor.  Thanks for all the smiles, Steve.
I truly sadden by the lost of such a great inventor who has made an impact on me you will be miss STEVE!!!
Steve Jobs had an enormous impact on me as a person.  A man who built something from nothing doing what he loved with his friends and colleagues.  Truly peerless in my eyes. I never got to meet him but I do feel like I knew  him on some level.  Heartbroken seems an appropriate response. It's because of him that I have a career. It's because of Steve that I get to be a part of the great family that is Apple. Steve helped me believe that I  too can do great things, if I choose to. Steve was a paragon of passion. We lost a legend today. Thanks for everything Steve. We'll miss you.
The world has lost a very 'gifted' person in Steve Jobs.  Few people   have had as much influence on our everyday life as Steve did.  He will   be missed very much. My thoughts and prayers are with his family. 
I am a 17 year old boy in Iowa.  Quite simply Steve Jobs was the  greatest hero the world has ever seen.  He was a man who was loved by so  many, and a man who changed the world.  He was the greatest hero because  he was a man who came from nothing and was perfect in an imperfect way.   He stood for being yourself and not letting anyone change you, and that  is something that I try and live my life by.  I use his principles in  life everyday, he has taught me how to live my life.  He was a man who  changed the lives of so many.  My biggest dream in life was to someday  sit down and talk with him, and the fact that I will never do that  breaks my heart. someday I will be out there in the valley working for  Apple. It is my dream.  And if there is one thing that Steve has taught me, it  is that I better as hell go for my dreams.  RIP Steve We all mourn the loss of the Jobs family&nbsp;
I am truly sad eventhough I'm just a consumer who only knew Steve Jobs through the clean, bright and beautiful elegance of the products he created. Seeing his latest and greatest coming around again and again was a pleasure and a wonder. I feel lucky to have lived in a time when he made magic. Condolences to all of you who were close to him. 
Mr. Jobs,  Thanks for changing the world.  You will be missed.
Thanks Steve Jobs, you have changed my life, the way I think and the way I do  things. You were an amazing man and a genius at that. You will be missed but your legacy will live on. Rest in Peace.
To the Apple Family and the family of Steve Jobs   Our prayers go out to the Jobs family and friends and the family at  Apple.  Steve created an entire world and possibilities with technology that was  easy for all users to learn and enjoy.  Thank you for all that you have created and given the world Steve!  Thank you Apple!
I wouldn't be who I am today without Steve. Rest in peace we will all miss your amazing mind so much. Lots of love to all of his family and friends. The world has truly lost one of it's most brilliant minds. 
Thank you Steve. You have changed the way I listen to, store and organize music, photos and video content. You have made me a much more efficient worker as well. Thank You and god bless. May you rest in peace.
...my blue iPod Shuffle. ...my orange iPod Nano. ...my white iPhone 3G. ...my silver Macbook Pro. ...my black iPhone 4. ...my black iPad. And finally, ...my soon-to-be white iPhone 4S.  From a true blue Apple baby who just lost a father... though your legacies would surely go on, it would never, ever be the same without you around.  Steve Jobs i.salute.you  RIP &nbsp;
Dear Mr. Jobs,  Your inventions, your drive, your passion for creativity has made a profound impact on the lives of so many people. I can't think of a more important figure in humanity in the past 30 years. To see the technology that you have masterminded gives me the belief that one day we will touch the stars in ways we never could imagine, to become more than who we are, and to continue to strive for perfection and excellence. I truly thank you for all you have done for us.&nbsp;
 Gosh, he was like a super inspiration for me this week, just because i wanted to be like him i got A's in all my classes&nbsp;
My first Apple was an Apple IIe, and I've had Mac products ever since. I've  always appreciated how easy they were to use. Now I teach communications at a university, and I realize how challenging it is to reach people at an intuitive level. I also realize how much communication behavior has changed because of the Mac graphic interface, iTunes, the app store, and the iPhone. Thank you Steve Jobs for being the Thomas Edison of this generation.
I joined Apple in January 1985 as a Systems Engineer.  Steve Jobs had just introduced the Macintosh, on the heels of "Lisa".   I was so inspired and always delightfully surprised by the elegant technology that Steve brought to light; his vision and the style in which he communicated was pure excitement.   The culture of Apple Computer was simply amazing and I knew that being there during that time was just the greatest gift.  I knew I was witnessing and was part of making history -- and it shaped me as a person and changed me forever.        Being at Apple was like being a Rockstar - Steve had set a tone, a vision, not just for products - but for a lifestyle and freed people to think different (before it was the marketing slogan) --- you could contribute and build on your ideas!   You had the freedom to make them happen.  I have carried that with me.   Steve demanded excellence, and he was radically committed to making the products meet the vision - they simply had to be "insanely great".   Every Apple product from the dawn of time, "just works" and was truly, insanely great - delivering Steve's passion to the rest of us.        I personally send my condolences and thank the family of Steve Jobs for lending him to us and supporting him to do the great work he did.     I thank Steve for his drive and for creating this great company, these great products that launched my career and truly changed me; I have a lifetime of friends from my time there, as well as memories that are my most cherished.     I want to say, he will be missed - but his vision and that journey will continue.  The people at Apple will ensure it.     Because of what Steve did - because of how he shared himself with us, I feel that I live like he did - living every moment like it could be my last, being extremely passionate about my beliefs, being mindful of the details and seeking to be elegant, sophisticated and casual all at the same time. Thanks for teaching us.  Thanks for taking us on your journey Steve.     Rest in peace..see you on the other side.  
Although it's difficult today to see beyond the sorrow, May looking back in memory help comfort you tomorrow....  
I feel very sad that you passed away. When I was 12 I got my first   Apple II computer and then later in life my husband introduced me to   Apple again and I will never get any other computer. You are a true   genius creating from passion inside and so innovative in all you   created. You are in my prayers and I think now God above will be so   excited to have you on his/her tech team in heaven. I now you can keep   on creating no matter where you are at!  You will surely be missed. Much love to all your family and friends   who are grieving.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for all you did! From Russia with Love!!!!! 
 My name is Lukercio and I from Brazil,About 4 years ago I begin use Computers and I was facined, I soon wanted to learn everthing about computers, where they came from, who had the majestic idea of developing machines for personal use. Was when I discovery the legendary Steve Jobs a person who inspired me in everthing I do and let me the objective of work at Apple, something that I dream every day and is increasigly close to reality, even when far away. I know I'm young, I'm only 17 years old, but mostly that I have by the ability of learning and the love for this company, one day I will have the honor of working at the company of someone who inspired me and changed my future objectives with their creations.Rest in peace my friend Steve Jobs, thank you for everthig. Ps: I'm learning english, so I'm sorry my mistakes.              
Sincere condolences to Steve's family and all at Apple. I agree with the sentiments echoed on the Apple website home page. "the world has lost an amazing human being"
My heartfelt sympathy to Steve's family and friends and the entire   Apple family. My God watch over you and keep you within the palm of his hands and   love in your heart.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for all you did in showcasing the power of innovation. 
I will miss you. I don't know you personally, but you have made an impact on my life. I have a nack for computers, and watching you inspired me and told me I could do it too. Steve Jobs, you will be missed, and you will always be remembered. Rest in Paradise.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You're great We'll miss you a lot Hope your thoughts, energy and loyalty become a spirit for all Apple's employees and all of us Thanks Steve We love you&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  I know you'll never be able to read this, but I just wanted to thank you for your on going pursuit to provide us with technology that emphasizes the USER in user interface. Your ambitions have resulted in some of the greatest technologies of our time. I'm not a very religious person, but I would like to think that you're now with other great innovators that have helped sculpt our modern society with their creative thinking, and perseverance. My condolences to your friends, and family.
Steve has an amazing company , from saving it from almost being doomed and making it the most valuable company, he touched me forever and I am 14, he is  my idol.
Thanks for being changing the world all the time,I cannot imagine what the world will be today without Steve's contribution.He's a incredible leader and mentor.
Dear Steve,  Even though I didn't know you, I'm incredibly saddened at the news of your death.  I grew up with your products and your vision.  Never owning a PC, and jumping at the chance to own a Tangerine iMac when you came back to the company you helped create.  Thank you for making innovation, technology, and the world a much more interesting place to live in.  RIP
I remember the very first time I got an iPod. It was the shuffle, nothing much, but it felt like an elegant, wonderful thing. Then I got an iPod touch, a d I felt like I had discovered something magical. Now I own an iPhone and a  MacBook pro, and none of it would be possible without Steve Jobs. And I will miss him, because I love the products of his ingenuity and spirit. RIP.
A great loss to humanity. He will be missed *greatly *for *many* years to come.&nbsp;
As a long time Apple enthusiast, investor, user and promoter of anything and  everything Mac related I am truly saddened by Steve's passing. Having been born exactly the same year as Mr. Jobs, I can't help but feel that life can be cruel and unfair at times ... Life should just have been beginning for Steve ... His potential was just being realized.   A visionary like Mr. Jobs does not come along very often and I'm certain that he will be remembered as one of the greatest visionaries of our generation. I extend my deepest sympathies to Steve and his family.
We have been huge fans of your excellent taste!  Rest in peace!  Sincere condolences to the family!&nbsp;
It's a very sad day for all those apple fans and for those who were even closer to Steve jobs and his family , I wish them all very well and be sure that Steve was truly way ahead of his time as a visionary and will be missed by  us all. Thanks Steve for all your hard and passionate dedication to always  making things more advanced and easy the way they should always be, may you rest in peace for I feel as though I have lost another close friend.
     I am saddened to hear that Mr. Jobs has passed away. The world has lost  an innovative mind, body, and soul. Mr. Jobs has changed the worlds technology as we know it, and the way we the way we communicate, and he has put a smile on just about everyone's face the first time an iPod, iPhone or iPad was touched. Steve, you will be greatly missed. My condolences to the jobs family.
Dear Mr. Jobs,  Thank you for all you have done. You have inspired me for a long time.  You left behind the most amazing company ever created. You have inspired  me to study business and technology as my majors at Illinois State  University. I am currently 19 years old and hope to someday be just like  you. The love I have for Apple inc. is truly one of a kind. You will  always be a mentor, a visionary, and a hero I will look up to. I will  truly miss you...Apple inc. will not be the same without you Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
To the great memory of Steve Jobs.  You are not  only a great man but also a great HERO of mine.  For past   ten years, you have inspired me to be a great leader and motivate me   to not achieve best of everything.  You will never be forgot in my   heart, because you are a LEGEND. &nbsp; &nbsp;
I'm just a normal person with no connections to the Apple community. However, I somehow have felt a connection through the amazing products that Steve created and therefore feel the hurt that all of you must be feeling today. Thank you for the wonderful products.  And I thank you IN ADVANCE for the wonderful products to come, in honor of one of the most innovative minds in history.
 All I can say is may god bless him and his family. We have lost a great visionary and brother. RIP. 
Just wanted to convey my sympathy to the family of Steve Jobs... He prompted me to learn more about communicating with the ones we love and admire by iPhone, iPad or laptop... and not be too intimidated by all the hardware! Many thanks for you enlightening all of our worlds with your genius.
Hello  I just knew in this morning and I very shocked. So I want to say goodbye to you. I really love your products including you. Rest in peace.
Steve is the hero of the world. For me , he changed my ideas in many ways.  I am very familiar with his life even I am in China.  Goodbye, Steve!
we will miss you, what you have been done in the world no one will  forget. wish you happy in other life.
My condolences and best regards to the Jobs family in this painful loss!  We all will miss him! &nbsp;&nbsp;
My first job in college was selling the original Mac 128k in 1985. Much of my life has been guided by his vision and innovation. I think his long lasting legacy will be the term "simplicity". &nbsp;
May your soul rest in perfect peace Steve. For most of us you will  always be alive. We appreciate your contribution to our generation. 
Thanks a lot Steve Jobs....  
The world just lost a true visionary. Just think of what Mr. Jobs has revolutionized, everything, for the better. He took great ideas and made them real. Without him we would never have Toy Story, we would never have any of the i products. We had music and movies but now we have MUSIC and MOVIES. But he is now in a better place, he is now at peace and resting. If he was suffering he is no longer and his family can now be at peace as well.
He definitely was revolutionary in the field of advancing technology. All of my Apple products have always felt years in advance, and you simply couldn't find a better product. &nbsp;THANK YOU! 
To me, Steve was a man who did his best every day. He didn’t settle for anything less, and he didn’t allow the people around him to do so either. He was never afraid to challenge existing ideas. He taught people to live each day to the fullest. His vision lives on in hundreds and hundreds of young people. They, too, have made it their life’s work to reduce the barriers between people and the technology they use. The universe has been dented. Goodbye, sir. Thanks for changing my life.
Seven years ago I lost my dad, he had a pancreatic cancer too.  I know how terrible this disease and I offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.  Until the last day I believed and prayed that Steve would win this disease. He will be remembered forever as the man who made a dream as a reality.
Thanks for making my life easy and worth living,  my world a beautiful place to live in, and giving me an education like no one else can. Thank You.&nbsp;
Dear Steve:  I don't know how to thank you, thank you for being an inspiring force, thank you for your legacy and one thing you can be sure of, you will always be in our thoughts and our hearts.
Today, we lost one of the greatest genius of our time.   RIP Steve.
A great mind left us today, we will cry and miss him, even the ones that didn't meet him, why? Because he changed our lives and the word in a way we couldn't imagine. One of the biggest companies, has lost a great worker, a man that changed technology as we know it today. We will miss you Steve Jobs, the greatest mind of the century. 
Steve, Thanks for everything.  Thanks for the memories. Thanks for the music. Thanks for the technology.  Thanks for the joy! 
RIP Steve jobs and thank you for your vision and amazing team at apple.&nbsp;
      Steve obviously has been a great person with his  personalities, creativeness, decisiveness which impressed millions of consumers and the much broaded range of people. We love Steve and the nice products he and the Apple team bring to  us.&nbsp;Best wishes to the great person, his family and  organizations!
Steve Jobs was an amazing person. He will be deeply missed by the world.  He has completely revolutionized the world. I remember when the iPhone  was announced. I couldn't wait to get mine and have never had a phone  other than an iPhone since it was released. We will forever miss him. 
Hello. steve jobs&nbsp;do going to heaven to kingdom. god bless him. thanks u 
Thank you Steve Jobs for everything. Even if we choose a competitor's product, your hand was there guiding its design. Your influence was felt throughout the world.  Thanks for everything. I hope you'll find the peace that was unjustly denied to you in your final days. 
I just wanted to say that I give my condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and friends.  The world has indeed lost a creative genius and global visionary.  His memory and legacy will live on not only with his products but with the lives he's touched and inspired.  While the world has lost an icon we can find peace in the fact that it was changed for the better in the brief time he was able to influence it. 
Thanks for motivating me so much and sharing with the world some of your  ideas. It takes men like you, with brilliant ideas, willpower and self  assurance to turn some hardware into powerful tools, and shift the  future as you did.  Rest in peace, Steve.
I am just one of millions of people that would like to pass my condolences to his family and may they have a good life in the years ahead and may it be filled with Happiness and Health.
My first computer was an Apple II+.  We had the 3rd Mac in our town.  Upon its delivery, I opened the package with my two young sons and wife.  We played the whole night with MacPaint and our new printer.  Life and technology and writing and art was never the same for our family.  The Mac proved to me the "mind amplifier" as promised.  The first son graduated Berkeley and the second from Cornell.  One excels in teaching, the other in landscape architecture.  THANK YOU, STEVE, for your gift to our family and our children.&nbsp;
Steve, did you know&nbsp;how much your vision, persistence and courage has impacted me personally and professionally? It's incalculable.  Your work will be part of my everyday life and I will love every second of it.  Thank you Steve.
Thank you Steve, for your hard work and dedication, you were a great visionary. 
Thank you, Steve, you let me dream and belive in something big. Rest in peace&nbsp;
Steve Jobs changed the world forever, and for the better. The world is a far less creative and truly less inspired place now that he has left it. 
Thank you Steve. You taught me the way of life. I immensely miss you.  Bye. 
 A Brilliant,  handsome,  inspiring,  hard working,  dedicated,  generous, genius left a enormous impact on us all.  The apple will shine on!
To Steve's family, friends and admirers:  Thanks; you will be sorely missed, but never forgotten.  A satisfied customer. 
When the notification popped up on my iPhone, I paused for a second in disbelief. A dark cloud immediately came over me, and I thought to myself why I would feel so deeply saddened for someone I didn't even know. I looked around at my iPad laying on the couch, my briefcase with my MacBook in it, the Apple TV my daughter was practicing her cheerleading on and the iPhone which has changed the way I communicate. I realized that even though I had never had the privilege to meet Steve, he was so intertwined with my life that he had become part of my life. It is a very sad day and my prayers will be with Steve and his family.
What a shock, we truly did lose the greatest visionary and creative mind of our times.  My heart goes out to his family and loved ones.  He has brought so much joy to the world with his ground breaking products.  I don't think I could imagine an iPhone/iPod free world.  I've seem him compared to Disney and Henry Ford, I whole hearted agree.  Each in their own right has made the world a better place to live and play.   Steve is without a doubt a modern day innovator as they were on their days.&nbsp;
He will always be remembered in my heart and I am so sorry for everyone  that was very close to him.
Plain and simple..Thanks for everything Steve. You changed the world in  a great way. You will never be forgotten. 
He was an inspiring person to many people like me who believe design and beauty are important to our lives. We will miss him!&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs a great visionary, your legacy will be with us forever.   
 Steve had always been a role model to many young ones, and I'm one of them . As an Entrepreneurship major college student, I have still too much to learn. However, one thing I am proudly inspired by Steve is his optimistic attitude toward failure. I know one day I will succeed, but before that I must expect failure.  Steve's spirit will always help me thought the hard time  and remind me never give up.&nbsp;
Hello, I never knew Steve Jobs, but he looks like a very nice and smart  person, I am 15 and I live in Canada, and he has been my  favourite person! Because of him I was able to enjoy the things that he  made and brought to this world, and I today will continue to love him  technology! This is just so upsetting that he is gone and I know that  the iPhone 4s was the last piece that he had designed, So Apple please  continue Steve Jobs passion and step ups for new products! R.I.P. Steve  Jobs!! God bless u and God bless your company! 
Thank you for the inspiration that you have given me and the strive to  make the world a better place.  My condolences to his family and  friends. 
A great man and a great genius has left this world, may God have him in his presence his legacy will continue for the years to come, he has left us a lot of new thing that change our mind and a great inventions that made a revolution on computers.&nbsp;
I cannot imagine a world without the vision of Steve Jobs.  He will be  missed! 
I'm a Russian born 18 year old guy who moved to Texas in 2001. I got my first iPod in 2004 and my first iMac in 2006 simply because my dad wasnt used to  it and didn't bother trying it out. Then came the iPhone and I came to realize how great your products are and how well everything "just works". I love  your products, your company, as well as your presentations on everything and your values. Thank you for bringing the best phones tablets and computers, as well as best services like iTunes and iCloud to the world and making my life easier and fun. You are a great example of a unique genius and  changed the tech world forever. We will miss you, and I hope your spirit truly does stay with Apple and continue to lead it forward.&nbsp;
Being an art director and graphic designer, I feel that I can speak on behal f of all of us in the design world when I say that we owe everything to Steve Jobs. Not only have his innovative, ground-breaking products changed our l ives beyond words, but (for me) what has been even more influential is the unprecedented esthetic which all the Apple products are know and coveted worldwide. Every aspect of the Apple brand has been so carefully carved from the amazing advertising campaigns down to the most minute Apple accessory.  Steve Jobs will be terribly missed and his extraordinary vision never matched.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs means to me my very first iPod, my iPhone and my Mac. Believe  it or not, the lost of such an incredible human like him, hurts.  REST IN PEACE STEVE JOBS.
My deepest condolences to Steve's Family!&nbsp;
Someone who envisioned, inspired and created such magical things and deeply changed our lives forever, will live on through his legacy.  Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs.   
It's with your incredible device that I send you a message. You have been the visionary of your society and a guidance to me... Thanks Steve, and good bye.
Steve Jobs will be remembered in history.&nbsp;
I have a great respect and admiration for Steve Jobs. A truly phenomenal human being of modern times and a great life story. vow!  may his soul rest in peace. AMEN&nbsp;
To the family, friends and co-workers of Mr. Jobs, our thoughts and prayers are  with you. 
I am sure that I am not alone when I say that thanks to the creative vision t hat Steve had, my life has been touched in many ways by the work he has done . I just want to say "thank you Steve". I am proud to hold your legacy in my  hands.
I just want to say that people take things in life for granted. At my campus, I see thousands of students everyday walk around listening to their iPods or iPhones, or use their MacBooks and iPads in class. It is unbelievable the size of the footprint that Steve has left on my generation. Forever will I remember what he did to enhance my life. Steve Jobs is a person who has revolutionized the world. Today is truly a sad day.&nbsp;
The best ever products made... truly a loss to everyone around the world. &nbsp;
  Why do I feel his loss so personally? I have never met him. But his vision, his design ethic, his company have touched my life in many ways. I carry one of his company's products in my pocket at all times and I face two more of his company's products all day every day at work and at school and they are my most trusted weapons of choice in my personal quest to contribute to creating a better world. I feel like a beloved member of my family has died. My thoughts and best wishes are with his family and closest friends in their time of grieving. Thank you for living amongst us Steve. I wish you peace and happiness wherever you have gone next.&nbsp;
The world has lost an inspiring visionary. 
Thank you, Steve. It's the end of an incredible era.  And to his family at home and at work, I am truly, truly sorry for your loss.  And just think how user-friendly heaven will be now... 
Few people come to this world to leave an indelible legacy in other  people hearts, inspiring them and lighting their ways in life. Thabk you  for being that person for me.&nbsp;
From the Apple II+ to my iPhone today- I have loved Steve Job's products and company. Thank you for making great products and having your vision.  Rest in Peace, Steve.&nbsp;
My condolences from Argentina, we will miss this true hero of the modern times, a man that built the future, we will miss him, we will miss his creativity. May he live in the eternal light of god.&nbsp;
Steve has been an inspiration to me...thank you for sharing your creative heart and energy through your Apple concept.  We appreciate you.
SJ has made such an impact on not only the world, but on everyone's life as we have all benefitted from his creations over the years in one way or another.  Steve Jobs- thank you for you and your gifts.  My thoughts and prayer go out to you family&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your incredible contribution to modern society.  It  is hard to imagine the world we live in without the many elements that  your creativity and vision have helped shaped.  You will be forever  remembered as a man with a clear vision of the future.
I don't know if I can say anything that hasn't already been said, but I  can definitely empathize with everyone's disbelief and sadness. Steve  Jobs was definitely one of the biggest visionaries of our time and I'm  sure that decades and maybe even centuries from now people will speak  about his impact on modern technologies in the same way that we speak  about Shakespeare and literature. To get to where we are now we've had  to come from something and whatever the amazing technology is that lays  before us in the future, the work and imagination of Steve Jobs was the  origination. I pray to have close to the same amount of impact on the  world that Steve Jobs had on this world while he was here with us.
This man will always be a legend.. enough said.
Thank you, Steve - for the wonderful products and the technological innovation that has touched all of our lives for the better. Deepest sympathy to the Jobs family and the Apple family for your personal loss. Steve will never be forgotten.
Steve Jobs not only gave birth to a pillar of technological genius in  his incredibly creative and visionary life, but he also created an  electronic platform in which the music industry has used to blossom to  the artistic power that it is today. If it weren't for the Mac OS, some  of the greatest pieces of music would not have been able to be produced  or conceived with the professionalism and intricacy that certain Mac  programs give us, in all genres all across the world. Steve Jobs has not  only left a legacy of grandeur, but also an already gleaming piece of  clay which can be shaped to be even stronger and more beautiful. The  first stones he set, all those decades ago, have turned into mountains  of splendour, and with his knowledge and trust carved deep in his many  co-working visionaries, a true artist of the 21st century can rest in  peace.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve for making Apple my way of living.&nbsp;
Our prayers are with Mr. Jobs' family and friends. He truly created the  very best experience for a human to interact with a non-human. We pray  that there are more innovators that fit his mold.&nbsp;
In 1980 I bought an Apple II on which I used to play chess after loading the program from a cassette drive. I wrote a Hangman program for it and it had even then something which its contemporaries didn't. In 2011 I bought an iPad, it has something which its contemporaries don't. I still have a BYTE magazine from 1984 with a cover article on the Macintosh which had everything its contemporaries didn't.  That je ne sais quoi came in great part from Steve Jobs, I hope Apple will prosper without him. And i wish his family courage and acceptance. &nbsp;
amazing person amazing inventor amazing soul rip steve jobs you will be missed your works will live on forever&nbsp;
I bought my first Mac Plus way back in the mid-eighties and and in the succeeding years stuck with Apple through thick and thin.   And boy, there were some thin times along the way.    I'm in my 70s now and still surrounded by Apple products.   Steve, your legacy of innovation will last for centuries. Bon Voyage.
The news is sad but the ability for him and his family to look back and be SO proud of his achievements is something should bring a warm feeling in their hearts. A celebration of his success with only a small regret he could not do a little more. 
We are all in his debt and there will be few whose heart will not ache  for this immeasurable  loss. 
My sympathies' to the Family and friends of Mr. Jobs. He was a visionary that the world will surely grieve for a long time.   My heart reaches out to you.
Steve Jobs is truly a remarkable person.  He revolutionized the way we think about technology.  He also paved way to a new way we use devices and gadgets such as smartphones and computers.  I may not know personally, but his passion and dedication to his work has inspired me a lot.  We all shall truly miss the man who changed the world.  VOYA CON DIOS STEVE JOBS.
Dear steve, My life revolves around my iphone, my ipod classic, my ipod touch, my macbook and my 2 imacs. For the past 5 years i've been enjoying these amazing products, built by the genius, that the world knows, and that genius is You. Thank you Steve Jobs. RIP
Steve Jobs' story is an inspiring American tale. While Apple will go on, Steve's shoes will never be filled.&nbsp;
Dear great innovator Steve,  I can't believe your sad news. You have changed and innovated our lives. I think you have contributed to the evolution of human being.  Thank you very much and rest in peace.
Steve set the example for all others who would seek to pursue a vision, to fulfil one's own potential, to empower the potential in others, and to live a purposeful life.  He made a difference.  He thought differently.  He changed the world.  The world is a better place for Steve having lived in it.&nbsp;
I would love to say that without Steve Jobs, I would have never begun to have a love for technology. Thank You Mr. Jobs, thank you.&nbsp;
I bought my first Apple computer (a Performa 6200) in 1994 and never   looked back. You were a luminary, a visionary, and an artist, and the   world is darker today for your passing. There may never be another   quite like you. Rest in peace. 
"i" in front of any product is beyond what Mr. Jobs envisioned. "i" can go a long way and is beyond selfish deeds and thoughts. "i" including many will miss the anticipation of your new products. iWillmissyourbrilliance.  "U" are in a better place now! God Speed Mr. Jobs&nbsp;
Hi.  I'm your fan.  I'm so proud of your passion, innovation.  Thank you Steve.  Good bye. 
I am a little older than Steve.  However, Steve always represented to me as the leader of us "Intelectual Revolutionaries" !  A college drop out that changed a culture!  A simple guy that aspired go help all gain access to a technology that otherwise would have been restricted to the elite of our country.  A guy who only saw fairness and beauty in simplicity.  Yeah, I never met Steve, but I got his vibe!  He truly is a saint in the same vein as Pope John Paul II who also was a simple a simple guy. God bless Steve and may he rest in peace!&nbsp;
I regret the loss of that human being as valuable. I hope your loved ones can continue the dream of Steve.
You will always be the real technology hero. Your legacy will last 4ever. Steve is our today's Mozart.  You changed the world, our life, the music and technology.  The humanity will be thankful 4ever with Steve!   Thanks Apple, thanks Steve.  My condolences to this genius' family.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs. You were amazing man with an incredible vision..you changed the world. SALUTE!&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for bringing to this life such a beautiful brain. You will always be a person I aspire to.  You will be deeply missed by all.  I love and respect you as a person and I wish you rest and peace in your afterlife.&nbsp;
 The World and Creativity will miss Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs you will be missed and the way you revolutionized computers. I'm currently writing you off of my macbook pro which i just bought and i want to say thanks for all your dedication to bringing us the best technology.  God bless your family&nbsp;
 Steve changed the world as we know it.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs was a great person. And not only was, as always. He will always be remembered for generations. He reinvented our concepts of technology. Too bad it's gone so soon, but for sure he is happy ... For he is gone, but left only good things for us. Not only technologies like the iPhone, or iPod Ipad, but great and wonderful life lessons. REST IN PEACE, STEVE JOBS.
Steve jobs influenced the technological realm. He redesigned what we  thought to be common, and made it extraordinary. He took something  insignificant, and changed the world. He changed how we lived, how we  looked at technology. He took silicon, copper, and wires and created the  best.  He did not view technology as an machine, but as an art. His  work, his effort, and his legacy live on. He was not just a CEO. He is an &nbsp;icon, one who will not be forgotten.
Steve and the entire Apple family-  We have been a dedicated Mac family forever....the innovations Steve   and his team brought to this planet via technology have been life   changing to say to least for most of us... I knew he was sick but logging on to our iMac tonite and seeing his   image told me he was gone.....I guess I never dreamed he would be gone   just like that.....  Carry on folks....and sorry for your loss, words can not express   adequately...
Our deepest condolence. May his soul rest in peace. He vision will live forever.
 I was deeply saddened to hear about the untimely death of Steve Jobs.  I found  out the same way as many people did, I received a tweet on my iPhone.  I had had  the pleasure of learning how to use a computer when I was in graduate school in  the late 1980's.  I had learned on a Mac SE.  I learned not to be intimidated by  the machine and grew to love it and found I had a knack for them which I would  have never discovered had Mr. Jobs not pursued his visions.  He has changed  technology as we know it and his impact is endless and will continue to grow in  his absence.  I wish to send my heartfelt condolences to his wife and children.  Your husband  and father will not only live on in the products he envisioned but he will  continue to be in your heart and will be watching over you.  God Bless you all.&nbsp;
Hi there,  I just wanted to say thank you to Steve Jobs and for all of his inspirational work.  If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have a job as a web designer or even just the tools to do my job!  Steve's vision helped fuel my creativity and for that I will be forever grateful.  Thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
Steve was what we all wish we could be.  He has inspired and touched  people in every corner of the world and the world will be less without  him.  Blessings and Happy Trails.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for everything. You are and always will be an inspiration.
To all who knew Steve Jobs and especially to his family,  My condolences for your loss.  He was an amazing man and with his vision and work made our lives easier and a whole lot more fun.
I never met Steve but have followed him since the early days and if it  could be done, and this is the only person I would do this for, I would  have gladly trade my life for his survival.  He has so much to offer and  bring to the good of mankind...he will be missed 
Very sad. Thank you Steve and Apple for your contribution to the world of communication. It's much appreciated.&nbsp;
To Steve's Family, Friends &amp; Collegues,  My sincere condoleances to all of you.  Steve brought us the first PC available to everyone (the Apple II), then the first PC with a graphical UI available to everyone (the Macintosh), then the first user-friendly smartphone available to everyone (iPhone) and then the first user-friendly tablet available to everyone (iPad).  Without knowing it, the world has a lot to thank him for. Steve "set the bar" in personal computing and the world followed… He was a truly amazing guy! A leader and a true visionary!  Thanks Steve… for all you have done. Rest in peace now Steve. You will be sorely missed.
Although I did not know Steve Jobs personally, his creation allowed me to capture priceless and precious moments, communicate and stay in contact with those I love the most and above all allowed me to better myself as a person.All I have to say to him is, thank you and rest easy now.
Although I never met Steve, his work, his vision and how he carried himself has always been an inspiration.  His legacy is astounding, and the world is definitely a better place for having had him in it and a sadder place for now having lost him.  My condolences and best wishes go out to the immediate and extended Jobs family.  Thank you Steve, for everything. You've changed the world.
Excellent work of a great man. You have changed de world!   
The Benjamin Family will pray for comfort and peace for the Jobs family  during this trying time. Mr. Jobs was simply a genius. There will never be another like him.&nbsp;
Was born the year I was born, 1955.  And I will always remember his passing on my birthday.  The most amazing and best graduation speech ever delivered was his speech at Stanford University.   
Steve Jobs, you will be missed. Truly a technology legend but more important, an amazing human being. My thoughts are with you family. I hope that the void of your loss is filled with the thoughts of the millions of people who loved you and whose lives were touched by Your brilliance and passion for technology.
You never failed to give us something we needed to use, and you always  wrapped it in something we wanted to own. For the past 20 years I've used Apple products, my world has expanded  beyond my own imagination - all because of yours. Thank you, Mr. Jobs.
The world lost a true genius in Steve Jobs who revolutionized the present and the future for all ages.   My sincerest condolences to his family and friends.  On a personal note, it was Steve Jobs that converted me from the PC world to the Apple\iOS world with his insightful guidance and belief in the people and vision of Apple.   A true visionary for Apple enabling it to become true technology leader that it is today.  Steve will be truly missed.
I have so much respect for Steve, He inspired me so tremendously the last decade, Thank you, very much.&nbsp;
May you finally rest in peace.
Though I did not know Mr. Jobs on a personal level, his accomplishments and leadership style speak for themselves. I have ambitions of starting a company and I have always said, "I want to be like Steve Jobs". He has definitely been an idol and will be dearly missed. Mr. Jobs, tonight I drink in your name. R.I.P. 
Thank you for being a visionary. Thank you for helping my 18 month old already discover this amazing world. He only knows a few words and one of them is  iPad. You will be greatly missed and your imagination and spirit will live on in generations to come.&nbsp;
Jobs was so intimately the hub of Apple's culture, its products and customer relations that schmucks like me who never met him felt we knew him like a family member.  His utter dedication to the success of Apple and its customers created a generation of devotion.  His passing feels deeply personal.  We all were so fortunate to have benefitted from his genius, his passion and his dogged dedication. 
Steve Job’s commencement address at Stanford is the reason I was brave enough to switch my major a year away from graduation from something I panic-picked to something I fell deeply in love with later. For the first time in what feels like a long time I can say that when I ask myself “if today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" and the answer has not been “No” for many days now. Thank you Steve Jobs. The world is so much better having had you in it.
His Vision has changed my life and the world for the better. My prayers  go out to Steve's family at home and at Apple.&nbsp;
Thank you for everything Steve.  You will be missed!!&nbsp;
Hello, Steve Jobs. Thank you for everything that you've done. You change my vision for everything in this world.
Silicon Valley—actually, the world—is full of “me too” thinkers. But every now and then there’s a man who’s vision and passion trumps conventional thought. THANK YOU Steve Jobs for persevering regardless of the naysayers. You will live on long after today.&nbsp;
  May God bless Steve Jobs and his family.  I admired him as an innovator, creator and pure genius.   He was an inspiration at so many levels.  His legacy will live forever.  We will miss you Steve.  You will be an inspiration to others forever.   You made a positive difference.....you changed the world...     Thank you and God bless you.       
The iPod changed everything. Apple and Steve changed the way we live everyday.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs made a large impact on how I see the world... I never met him personally... But I am thankful for everything he's done during his life! He will be greatly missed by the world! My prayers are with his family.&nbsp;
Steve,  You have been the second most inspirational person in my life, second only to my father. Trust me, my mother means well.  You are the opposite of what society tries to program. You are what society needs.  I will go against the code. I will change the world.&nbsp;
  Steve Jobs was, is, and will always be 'The Man' ! Steve Jobs 4ever&nbsp;
Apple has brought my family closer, and that  is all thanks to Steve Jobs and the wonderful creative team that worked  with him.  Watching Steve Jobs present the new products was magical. He brought so  many great products to life and for that, I cannot thank him enough. Bless you, Mr. Jobs, for bringing the world so many wonderful things!  You will be missed.
 Your vision and talent changed the world. To think you made everyone comfortable to address you as Steve showed such humility. You will be remembered and missed. Thanks Steve. 
Simplemente  GRACIAS&nbsp;
Steve changed the world.  Sorry for the loss his family and the world  have to face.  He is in my thoughts and prayers. 
When I heard that Mr. Jobs was very sick I wrote him a letter and posted it on my personal blog. Then when I heard he'd resigned I wrote him another letter. &nbsp;I wish he could have read my letters. I wanted him to know how much his remarkable contribution had touched my life.  I hope everyone who knew him personally and loved him are feeling comforted and sustained.&nbsp;
I worked with my first computer in 1981, an Apple II and I was a fan, but when I saw the first stories about the Mac, I knew I had to have one. I still have it and it still works like new. I followed every story about Steve and Woz and the company they created. The pirate flag over the Mac team is a favorite. When he left Apple, I kept following because inevitably the products he championed were always slicker, cooler, and frankly more comfortable to use than anything anyone else had. I and my wife consider Pixar every bit as much a Jobs triumph and maybe in the spirit of it all - Pixar has always seemed to BE an Apple product. Really at the end of the day, products are just that - it's the imagination and forward thinking that Steve exemplified. He's a role model for me and always will be. Sleep well.
Dear Steve,  You are one of my idols because its not the fact that you grew from rags to riches, but it is the fact that you put so much hard work and determination and survived. You are a motivator, inventor,a leader, and a visionary. The world appreciates and will remember what you have done and so have I. Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;
To Steve Jobs Family and friends and the entire apple family my most sincere condolences.    An amazing person has left our world but his teachings, creativity and innovation has stayed and will stay with us forever . Aside from all the legacy he has left behind I just hope that all of us could learn to live like him: live our life to the fullest in the same way he did: I will keep in my heart a phrase he said to Stanford graduates and hope to live up to it:  "Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become"   RIP Steve Jobs the whole world will miss you!
What horrible news this is. Have not stopped crying since I found out.  Steve, you were truly a visionary who not only built the largest company in the world, but also changed the lives of millions, if not billions of people, who got the benefit of experiencing the magnitude of your work.  As I grew up and enjoyed the Macintosh Plus and later on Toy Story,  my daughter is now growing up, loving her iPad, iPod and "Finding Nemo".  And even when you're gone, your legacy will live on for generations to come, most likely forever.  You've truly made the world a better place.  You will be missed, but never forgotten. Rest in peace.  My best wishes to your family.
  To Apple and Jobs family. &nbsp;Steves soul remains in each of these greats products that this and next generations  Will love Forever
So sorry to APPLE family.  I feel like I am part of that family.  We love our APPLES.  iPhone, MacBook Pro, iPad, my husband and I both have them.  My husband is currently fighting metastatic colon cancer.  Our trips to the hospital and chemo lab have been made better because we have had APPLE technology.  Your technology and support have been awesome.  We have attended a free class at Best Buy for our APPLE computers and have loved it.  Steve Jobs had vision and has affected the lives of so many.  My students have benefited from APPLE support, training, and technology. What a loss of a creative soul!
My mother brought home an Apple IIe, and told the ten-year-old me, 'This is going to change our lives.' I believed her, but I could not have imagined how much Steve J., Steve W. and everyone at Apple would provide the very foundation of my life. I wrote code on that Apple IIe. I wrote my Master's Thesis on a Powerbook 100, and my dissertation and first book on a MacBook. Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
 Steve was my hero. He was a great man in the world of technology. I was raised along with technology. We're all going to miss him, he was a great man. R.I.P Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I was so sorry to hear about Steve Jobs.  He was an inspiration to us all. I will treasure his memory for a long time to come.  His spirit and innovation will be recognized throughout history.  I am fortunate to have lived in a time where I could benefit from such an innovative and brilliant individual.&nbsp;
  "changing the NeXT world by being different!"  thank you, Steve... for help making my life interesting and useful.
I am someone that has only been a part of the Apple world for a few short years. Because of the genius Steve jobs was, my everyday life is much easier. I am forever grateful for the technology he created and the dedication he showed in making that technology what it is today. You will be remembered and missed by all who are lucky enough to have known you through your greatest achievements.   "Finding myself to exist in the world, I believe I shall, in some shape or other, always exist." - Benjamin Franklin 
Steve was a Great man...the Magic Maker. On my iPad I will always have him as my screen in my memories. He will always have changed my life. RIP my dear  friend.
steve even though I never met u, the lives of many people were touched by your perfection, n I am sure you brought a lot of families closer to each other,even  when they thought only god could, imagine how many kids got to see their dads n moms over in afghanistan n irag because of ur video chat that u n the team at apple made possible.I know im gonna miss u.people like u are very hard to come by thank u steve for all the things u made possible n may god bless ur soul n embrace ur family n children in their time of need.
 I'm so sorry to hear that the one of innovator in the world left this world.   I am Korean, who really love &amp; respect the wonderful perfections he had completed. He was the one of man who can make me to beat high and expect.  We never forget him &amp; what he had made for the world.  He is the best creator who I ever known.  Please keep his ideology, fame &amp; creative ideas.    Many thanks &amp; deepest sympathy, &nbsp;Post Script Many Koreans have been expacting iphone 5 for long time. Also now, I'm waiting the time when I can use iphone 4s instead of iphone 5. Of course I'll get it immediately when you put up the iphone 5 !!               
Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family. As I type this on my Apple computer, while talking on my iPhone...I am overwhelmed with  sadness. what an incredibly amazing man. we are so blessed to have him  on this earth.
I was shocked and sad to hear the news of his death, there is no replacement for a creator and innovator for Apple. He was indeed a great mentor to so many and I will never forget his great influence in the world of Desktop Publishing and make it affordable and flexible to so many who enjoy creating images to remember for the rest of our lives.  I sure hope that future generations never forget a great man like Steve Jobs. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Einstein, da Vinci... Jobs? A true innovator and visionary. &nbsp; Thank You.
just a quick note to say, I feel the world has lost a great mind, and to  those that new him, I am sorry for your loss.&nbsp;
The world has truly lost an amazing person. Steve Jobs' vision, genius, and his capacity to believe and his ability to laugh at the impossible is truly boundless. His drive for excellence and his passion for brilliant, consumer-friendly technology has left an indelible mark on the world. Never before has the world seen such a man since the likes of Albert Einstein, Johannes Gutenberg, Nicolas Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Johannes Kepler. One man's vision has become the reality of many. "Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life." -Steve Jobs. Today, we are all at a loss. 
As a 47 year old, I grew up "knowing" Steve Jobs. My first computer was a T RS-80 but only lasted 3 months once I saw Steve's Apple IIc.  I was hooked  because it opened up a whole new way of thinking.  At that point I knew Ste ve was different than IBM, Microsoft, Dell, and everyone else.  All throughout the years of watching Steve's ups and downs, I have always a dmired his  commitment to Perfection; a standard that most in the business  had no understanding.  Even now more than 30 years later, Steve continued to change then world and  challenge what was conceivable.  Far off in Atlanta I see how we should ne ver be happy with the standard, old, beige boxes but to push for imagination (or perhaps to be inspired by a Xerox idea) and go after it with ferociou s tenacity.  Thank you, Steve.  A sad day, indeed.
I was shocked today when i heard that Steve passed away, a great human being and a role model for our&nbsp;life. We miss you so much steve. Condolences to family and friends.&nbsp;
Steve is the greatest man I had ever known, he made life So meaningful, not only his, also our's as APPLE's customers. He's the role model of being a successful man. No matter how bad his external environment was including his own  health conditions, he fought for his dream and excellence to the very end. We will miss you.&nbsp;
I'm a UX designer living in CO. I firmly believe that Steve Jobs had a significant hand in demonstrating the need for my profession. Ensuring that beautifully designed experiences with products are the norm, not an anomaly.   Thanks, Steve for everything you've brought and taught.&nbsp;
Steve was a visionary, he was an ever-illuminating&nbsp;charisma&nbsp;that changed the way we, common people view computers. He was one of the most&nbsp;influential&nbsp;Americans to ever walk the face of earth. He will be sincerely missed by me and my family.&nbsp;
He was such a special person, changed how we all look at computers in  such fundamental ways, God rest your soul, Mr Jobs and give you  everlasting peace.
For a reason I can't quite articulate, I am deeply moved by the passing of Steve Jobs.  I have never met the man, and yet I find myself writing this email.  As an educator in the state of Maine, we have a contract with Apple for our MLTI project that places laptops in the hands of every student from grades 7 -12, and many more of the older versions are being used by students in the lower grades.  We have been collaborative partners with Apple for the past decade, helping students prepare for the 21st Century with authentic and critical knowledge of technology.  I sit here now with my own Mac laptop writing this email, looking across the room at my iPod Touch, iPod, and iPad wondering about the future of a company I have put so much trust in for my technological needs, realizing just how much of that trust was placed on the many introductory video clips I have watched about the latest and greatest Apple creation, presented by Mr. Jobs.  To watch them was to believe...but now I realize that it was he I was trusting.  I'm sure that Apple will continue his legacy, but certainly it is difficult hearing that the heart and sole of the company has passed.  Even more, after reading about his relationship with his family, it is only now that realize just how great a man he was.  With all my prayers and sympathy...rest in peace Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
Oh,my Gosh, A Genius  lost. I loved his enthusiasm, energy, and creative mind! The world will miss him.&nbsp;
  He will live forever in every apple, in every user, we will remind you  every day.  He said that the innovation is the most important and I agree with him,  he was and inspiration for many people, and we miss you, thanks for all that you gave us.  Thanks for all, thanks for all that vision.  Thanks Steve Jobs!!!! 
 Buenas Tardes:                      Mis mas sentidas condolencias por quien fuera en vida un genio, que Dios lo tenga en su santo reino            
I would like to share my condolences to Steve Jobs and the whole Apple family, RIP Steve Jobs.  He built a company that is now the most popular company in the world it's bigger than microsoft, it's bigger than sony, it's bigger than HP, and so on and so on. I just wanted to say RIP Steve Jobs one more time and thanks for all the apple products you have given to use over the past decade.  I will always be an apple fan boy because of Steve Jobs and may Apple continue to be successful in memory of Mr. Jobs. He changed everybody's life including mine RIP Steve Jobs :'( 
Dear Steve Jobs, You give us lots of new things. And take us to new world of company.  We always remember you. Goodbye Steve jobs.&nbsp;
He will be missed but just imagine what he can do now.  God blessed him and he blessed all of us.&nbsp;
Steve,  My deepest feelings are for you now. You changed the world, you changed us all. Thanks for creating Apple, for being an inspiration with your life and  success. I will always remember you.
We lost a great man today. Steve changed the world. He will be missed. 
Rest in peace Steve, you will be dearly missed and are a huge loss to society. 
Initially, I knew that Steve seemed to be a great man but mostly for his communication skills and his products. Since I have started my executive MBA, I am convinced he was really a source  of inspiration in terms of strategy, human value, determination and visionary. I have been deeply touched by your speech at Stanford and will remember forever...  God bless you. Heaven is waiting for you to pursue your quest of innovation.
Dear All,  I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to Laurene Jobs, her family and everyone else who worked with and loved Steve Jobs. His life has truly touched many.   I am truly appreciative of the gifts in my life thanks to Apple products. The iPhone and the iPad have been great tools for me to reach out and touch my loved ones.  I enclose prayers for Steve and his family.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to the family.
My thoughts and prayers are with your family, Steve Jobs.   I have the privilege to own an iPhone, and now a MacBook Pro.    Thank you for such great inventions.      Apple &amp; the World have lost you, but you left us with such great things to remember you by. &nbsp;
I'm just a customer but I still feel inspired and saddened. Thoughts and prayers to the Jobs family.&nbsp;
I was so saddened to hear the news of Steve Jobs' passing.  I offer  prayers for a soothed heart for the Jobs family and friends and the  entire Apple, Inc. family and may you all find peace and comfort in your  wonderful memories of a wonderful man.
This man was an inspiration. And his vision was magical. The world has truly  lost an amazing man. I will miss him very much. My condolences to his famil y and coworkers and all the countless others who Steve touched.
Still we cannot believe it. We are a young entrepreneurial software company from the Netherlands and   he inspired us to grow! HE MAY NEVER BE FORGOTTEN because of the work he has done for the industry.  (and entrepreneurial personality)     Might you have any further questions don't hesitate to contact us again.&nbsp;
How Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein contributed greatly in their innovations and visions, Steve Jobs has done the same to the world of computing. His memory will forever live on in the great companies he has molded and the paramount technology he has had a great influence in creating.  His leadership and business etiquette are grand examples of what all businesses today should  possess. Mr Jobs will be greatly missed and my prayers go to his family. Thank you Steve Jobs for paving the way to a brighter more innovative future.
Thank you for showing me the NEW WORLD.  Thank you for your innovation.  Rest in Peace.
I lost both parents to this terrible disease. Today, another great man leaves this Earth and leaves a legacy behind that will be talked about for centuries to come. Some live for 90 years, and never touch as many lives as Mr  Jobs did. Thank you and may you rest in peace. Say hello to mom and dad..&nbsp;
I was one of the first Apple Store employees that was hired to open the Tyson's Corner Apple Store. I was there in the morning, ready to work the floor on the grand opening. We were checking the products one last time before opening the doors to the public, and I turned on a Canon Elph camera. It was in "play" mode, showing the pictures that were taken previously. The first picture I saw was of Steve! He'd taken a picture of himself with it the day before on his walk-through of the store. He was unshaven and happy. Clearly doing what he loved, and loving the retail venture he had decided to kick of. I'll always remember THAT image of Steve. Looking how he wanted to look, and happy doing what he loved to do.&nbsp;
My heartfelt Condolences to his family and friends.  I felt very saddened when I heard the news this morning on the radio.  I actually had to pull over and wipe my tears away.  Rest In Peace Mr. Steve Jobs.
He was a great man. His idea was amazing. Without him i don't know what  gadget will i use for today. His personality and creations will be  remembered forever. Rest in peace Steve. 
I'm just a poor student from Switzerland, but with a huge love for  computers, and that's thanks to Steve Jobs. I grew up with Macintosh computers, I learned to use them and love them  and impress my friends with their elegance. When the iMacs came out, my  dad and me were blown away and my dad saved money for a while to get  one. I've been working with macs since I was a kid, and thanks to them I  did amazing things with computers and learned a lot. Few companies have  such a visionary leader. Steve Jobs shaped the way we see media today,  and it's a good shape. Thanks!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is why I got into digital creation using Mac computers 20 yrs  ago, visionary is a very true statement on his behalf, I will always use  Apple products and I wish he could have seen the new campus before his  passing. My condolences to All of his family and the Apple family as well.
I just don't know what to say... without Steve, our computers would be boxes with blinking lights, our media devices would be CD Players or big, bulky hard disk players, our iPads would be a notepad and a pen, and our phones would be big, ugly, bricks. To Steve Jobs, one of the greatest men to ever live.
Steve Jobs was an inspiration to me as I followed him and his company from the Apple II Computer thru Macintosh and beyond.  My fondest memory, and first introduction to Apple was at the University of Texas Computer Store in Austin, where I was amazed at the wonders of this new computer.     Thank you Steve for the great and selfless contribution you have made.  The world is a better place to have known you.&nbsp;
Dear Steve.  I don't know what to say... But I want to say " Thank you!".&nbsp;
I am relatively new to the world of Mac.  Bought one for music  recording, and now I have a hard time using my PC in work and real life  at the house.  Everything makes sense.  Steve seemingly surrounded  himself by the best and brightest, to make the best and brightest  devices. Were they top notch top technology?  In some ways, yes.  Were  they perfect in their design, and function, most definitely.  I hope  with his impact on the world, he can make it a better place.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs the visionary of Apple who share his vision with the world.  Apple and Steve are one, who allow me to become more creative and  continue to dream and smile. I am thankful that he allow many to share  his world. We thank Him  and keep his family and the apple family in  our prays. We know his vision will continue to impact upward mobility of  the Company and continue to impact the world, through all those who are  influence, mentor directly or indirectly  by Steve. His Sprit live will  on.   Peace
Like other millions out there, I love music since I was a kid. The first time I had my first gen iPod video in my hands in 2005, I knew my life will be changed, indeed it was. It wasn't just a product anymore, it became part of my life. To me, Steve Jobs is the man who revolutionized music, and for that I'll forever be grateful. I think even in heavens he'll be introducing something new to the folks out there. Rest in Peace Steve. You'll forever be missed. My deepest sympathies to his family. And to the employees of Apple.
Steve Jobs made it possible for me to do what I love for a living. Without his vision, talent, and business savvy, I would never have had a career as a designer &amp; marketer; I can provide a great life for my family and myself, because of him.  Godspeed, sir.
One of the most important persons in the world, why, why did he have to leave? My prayers will be for him. We will all miss him. RIP my brother!
My condolences to the Steve Jobs family.  His Apple products have made my life so much easier.  I love my Mac Book Pro and  have&nbsp;Steve Jobs to thank.  He will be known for&nbsp;his brilliance and vision to change the world.  Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;
Steve - what a wonderful and amazing human being in 21st century. You are a visionary and creative leader. Not only for Apple, but also for the rest of the world. You changed the world with lots of innovative ideas. Your spirit will be left forever.&nbsp;
I am devastated my, family is devastated.  We have been proud Apple  family since 1988 and our home is a tribute to the vision that this  great man Steve Jobs had.  He built an institution that naysayers said  couldn't be accomplished and changed the world forever.  I, we, will  never forget what this brilliant man has provided.  Because of you we will always "Think Different".&nbsp;
The world will always indebted to Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak for the company they started in a garage many years ago. Their vision has surely changed the world and will continue to do so long into the future.  Steve Jobs will surely be missed!
Thank you for making incredible products! We can live in the present and the future thanks to your brililant ideas! We could share enjoyment and remember every precious moment through iPhone/iPad! And also we could feel the strong ability of human not machine! We'll remember your words! 'Stay hungry, Stay foolish!' Steve, you were the greatest existence to people all over the world and you are/will the memorable person in our minds FOREVER! R.I.P Steve Jobs! We'll remember you forever!
 This planet will not be the same without Steve Jobs.  My prayers and   thoughts are with you and your family during this difficult time.  May You Rest In Peace  
Heartbroken that he's gone....blessed that I can send condolence from my iPad
Dear Steve:   I hope you bring an IPhone with you to heaven to see God and You.
You were gone before we had the chance to thank you for everything you did for us. Drastically changed the landscape of the world and everyday of your life was a technological revolution. Without you we would not be anything but a man in the dark cave of Plato, nothing more than people in the dark crying out for help. You popularized the technology, brought to ordinary people something many thought impossible, you made your life a mission to make others' lives easier. With all your effort, large gadgets, dumb, ugly and became small, intelligent and beautiful. Thanks to your efforts, my iPhone just works. Now, to me, design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.  So I've been grateful. Thank You, Steve!   It was not sent from my iPhone, but still I thank you for everything.  From a Brazilian Applemaniac To the best man in the whole world. 
Every aspect of this man's life was inspiring. He truly knew that the world could be better and made extraordinary progress to make it so.  You will be missed but never forgotten. 
Thank you Steve,  for being able to impress my now mother in law for being a Mac user  (She ran one of the only Apple based technology labs in a Georgia middle  school) to being able to FaceTime my son's first few moment to friends  and family waiting in the waiting room at the hospital, thank you for  making those moments possible for us.  You will be truly missed by our family.&nbsp;
Just wanted to send an email to thank Steve and everyone that worked   with him for your brilliance and making the lives of people like me so   much easier. I've been a dedicated Apple product user for 10 years and   couldn't imagine life without the amazing products everyone at Apple   has created over the years. Steve will forever be remembered as a   genius who moved today's technology in the right direction. While I   didn't know him personally, I'm sure he was an amazing man who   undenyingly had an amazing mind. God Bless you Steve Jobs and everyone   at Apple.
All thoughts are with his family.   What a great man!  Rest in peace.
It's a shame that Good People go so young, my deepest sympathy to  Steve's family.&nbsp;
 Hello reader,  I just want to express my feeling in this moment. I think this is one of the biggest lost of our time. He was and will stay here to be a real model to follow. I'm sorry about this tragedy, I'll remember him as a mentor, his genius mind and points of view. Hope we all get better soon, it will be hard to take. My condolences to the family, good life to all
Stock prices, product updates and launches can never compare to the grief a community feels when they lose a member. Steve was more than the co founder of Apple, a family man and role model for many is gone.
So Sad and a great loss to future technological innovation.&nbsp; Steve Jobs &nbsp;will be well remembered for putting the fun back into computing and (smart) mobie phones.&nbsp;  And, he leaves behind a brilliant legacy of achievement and will never be forgotten.  RIP Steve... ....a Job Well Done!
You'll be my idol...for ever! Thank's for all your creations!!! Goodbye Dear Steve...&nbsp;
Wow!  What can I say.  An Apple II gave me my start on the road to my life as a software developer &amp; I still love your products.  Your vision made Apple what it is today.  You will be greatly missed.
I don't know what to say.   He's one of the reasons why I am in IT. Apple computers, from The apple 2 my Dad bought in 1985 to the MacBook on my nightstand this evening. The iOS devices that I've captured images of my daughter. Unique pieces of my life I have spent with and on devices he had a hand in bringing to fruition. This seems unreal but I knew when he stepped down he was in a bad way.   I never knew the guy but I did, do look up to him and his grand vision of things to come. An incredible innovator whom I'm glad I got to see, use and thoroughly enjoy the fruits of his and Apple Inc's labor. He's an original. Never be another.   I'm a very glad he is no longer suffering and passed on into the infinite loop.   He waited a day after product launch to go. Or that's what he'd have us believe.   The reality is that he's gone and never will be distorted in my eyes.   RIP Mr. Jobs.    Thank you.
Steve Jobs changed my life from the moment I got my first iMac. I dedicate my professional success to two great men: my father and   Steve Jobs. May they both rest in peace.&nbsp;
I just wonder how the good Lord likes his/her new iPad. Thanks so much Steve for your time on this earth and all that you gave us.&nbsp;
Wow!  The world has lost a creative, caring individual.   Apple II &amp; Apple Forever.
Thanks you for shaping my future Steve. Without your creative mind, we would  not have some of the technologies we have today. R.I.P. And thank you so much.
Thanks for everything!  Great job! Rest in Peace knowing you have positively impacted the lives of millions. Proud customer Apple IIc - MacBook Pro  
I'm just another person sending an email, about how sad I am to have lost a leader in our world. A man who had defined all of the laws of nature and swept every single person on this earth with his mind exploding, heart warming technology. I have an iPhone 4 and I am sending you this email from a MacBook Air. Steve, Thank you. You will be missed.&nbsp;
This news has shocked me rest my heartfelt condolences to Friend Steve Jobs
There may be much back and forth about the minutia of his life and his legacy, but there is no debate that he was the Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, or Walt Disney of this generation. R.I.P. Steve Jobs -- as great an innovator of progress as there ever was.
Dear Apple,  The world will always remember Steve for what he accomplished during   his life. No words can console the people how have lost him but he is   surely in a better world.&nbsp;
Hi Steve, I never knew or met you in person, but I feel that I know you like a   brother because I use your computers everyday, they are incorporated   into our family. Thank you for such wonderful products and platforms.
Rest in peace my man. Thank you for everything.&nbsp;
Steve is a great man. He inspires the world. When I knew the news, I cried. My words are simple, but my heart is with Steve.  He is a Miracle, He lives to the fullest!  --  Life is a Miracle, live it to the fullest ! 
Steve, We will forever miss you, yet always remember your legacy.  Thank you  for being an inspiration to us all — to become better human beings, and  change the world around us instead of the world changing us.
Steve Jobs will forever leave a mark on this planet, he will in turn never die. God bless Steve Jobs.
Ever since my first Apple to my first Macintosh, over 20 years ago, your inspiration was what kept driving me to where I am today. Without your passion and genius, I would not have had the opportunity to develop my core skills and assets I pride myself in.   For someone I do not know on a personal level, you have had the most impact on my life. For this, I send out a heartfelt thank you and my deepest condolences.  What a life to celebrate and to remember.&nbsp;
Hi  I'm only 12 years old but i am the most DIE HARD apple fan! I have bought both iPads the iPhone 3G, IPhone 4 and will be pre ordering the 4S. I also have a MacBook pro! I have always wanted to meet the person I admire the most! But I guess that won't happen, I wish Steve jobs to rest in peace. And I send my best regards to his family and friends. He will always be the most innovative and awesome inventor. If he hadn't made the iMac we would all be staring at big computer towers! May he rest in peace.
 A great genius has deceased. I first heard about Steve Jobs when I was in 9th grade and, since then, he's been one of the persons who inspired me. His incredible life history and his even more amazing capacity to create and direct one of the most valuable enterprises around the world its an inexhaustible source of inspiration for me (and millions of people, I'm sure) and will continue to be. From his hand we saw some of the more advanced, complex and revolutionary gadgets and ideas that have totally changed the world (and will go on). Today, his candle has gone out.  I'm afraid, but still sure that his life was an incredible example for lots of people.  Peace in his grave.  To his family, my condolences. Be strong.  To Apple, Be Strong. In Tim We Trust.                
Man is the greatest ever. And I will remember you forever Steve jobs I love you.
I remember using the Apple II, in grade school. We played Lemonade Stand!!!!  Now my Children play on our iMacs, iPhones, and iPod Touch.   We now create memories with all of our Apple products....  Thank you, Steve Jobs. 
I'm not sure what to say.  My first computer was a Macintosh, it changed my life. My job now, is working with Apple products, it's my career.  Thanks Steve, for everything. You will be missed.
My prayers go out to his friends and family.  Those of us who work for the company will long for his guidance and will continue to work hard to make his visions come true.
I got my first MacBook Pro this May 2011. It has forever changed my life.  Steve, you have changed this world with your amazing creations.  You are an amazing inventor, great businessman, and one of the smartest people on this earth.  May you rest in peace, and be remembered in the hearts of all those who knew and loved you.
Steve Jobs set an example for those of us who, despite seeing him on occasion as a parent at our children´s school, during most of our lives felt his unique influence in our academic and professional work and his ubiquitous presence in a world full of the beautiful interfaces he envisioned and delivered to us.      He had the impressive capacity to make our lives richer and simpler with technology.      Fortunately his geniality set the bar high for designers and engineers so that future generations will have ever better interfaces and smarter ways to benefit from technology. He forever changed the way we see, use and interact with technology. Not an easy feat.     Rest in peace dear Steve Jobs. You made a better world. 
As a professional Graphic Designer it makes me sad to think the man who made our lives fun, exciting and creative by inventing the Mac has passed away. I just hope with your passing that apple can still be as competitive as it is now. Your legacy will live on and us designers will honor your memory. Thank you Steve for sharing your creative genius with us..I will be or might say all of us Mac users will always be grateful to you. May you now rest in peace free of pain. We will miss you Steve!! 
I've been always on macs. Thanks, Steve, how you helped me on my work.&nbsp;
 I am really sad...my first computer was a Mac. Great genius of all times, revolutionary and dreamer person. 
Steve jobs was one of the crazy ones. He believed he could change the world and he did. That man has changed my life, the world, and has been someone who  has inspired me to do what I love. I never had the pleasure of meeting him in person, but it is as if I knew him as a close friend. His talent, originality, good taste, and motivation to keep pushing society forward will never be forgotten.   Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. You are my inspiration, and I will always look up to you.
I'm a computer programmer. I learned to program on Apple ][e's. My first computer was a Mac that my highschool gave me for free because it was broken. I spent weeks learning how it worked so I could replace the broken parts and get it working again. The first time I saw Steve's name, it was a signature in that Mac's case.  When the iPhone launched, I was #70 in line at the 5th Ave. Apple Store in New York. I waited overnight. When Steve announced the iPhone 3G, in his slides was a picture of me standing on that line.  It's not an overstatement to say the Mac and iPhone have literally made possible the awesome, flexible, enriched life I'm living today. I have Steve to thank for that.  Today's a very sad day.
Steve Jobs:  passing is a shock. The world will miss a true genius.
Truly a sad time, our blessings to Steve's family during these difficult times.  RIP Steve you will be missed!!&nbsp;
  You have changed not just the methods of computing but also the way we live our daily lives. Your legacy will always live in our hearts!  From the Philippines, I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family and friends of Steve. You will always be remembered. &nbsp;
I can't believe he is gone. Although I never seen or knew him, he was and  always will be a friend in everybody's hearts. 
In honor at the most bigger visionary in the world thanks because you &nbsp;are my inspiration in my life. Thanks Esteve Jobs&nbsp;
HI,   My prayers are with Steve Jobs family and all the people that were  touched by his genius. I purchased an Apple computer  after a lot of  persuasion from my son. When I turn on my computer, I will think of  Steve Jobs and his wonderful contributions.Blessings
I was shocked to hear Steve passed away - under his leadership, Apple  changed the way we live our lives. It's very sad to hear about such a  legend passing away - best wishes to Steve's family &amp; friends. Hope  Apple continues fulfilling his vision and legacy.
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the wife &amp; family of Steve jobs, a  man who revolutionized an industry, social media and the world with a  dream that changed 1 belief, 1 device, 1 person 1 at a time. God Bless  Our Deepest Sympathy. 
Steve's amazing innovations made computers accessible to many who  otherwise would never be able to use home computers. I remember when I  was in college many would e-mail  Steve with questions about  their Macs  and he would  respond to them directly.  Not many CEO's/executives of  companies have been  so personable. His spirit will live on through   many of his staff who have embraced his vision for his company and life.  His spirit will always be alive in all of us who have benefited from his  genius and  creativity which  gave us a more inclusive way to  interact  in life.  We will remember his "magic", always.&nbsp;
RIP Mr. Jobs. A visionary, a man who revolutionised the world as we know it, to create things only imaginable in sci-fi movies.  The man, the legend, gone but never forgotten. He'll be in the history books!
We always will remember him because we use his invention everyday&nbsp;
Steve to me was not just the CEO and Co-Founder of Apple, He was a hero,  an inspiration and an example of the true potential of what one person  can do to the world. Steve you started from nothing you fought your way through life and you  conquered everything in your way to changing the world. You are a true  inspiration for all who dream of one day changing the world too. Rest in  peace your job here is done.  You will be missed.
   Steve will be with us for all time in the best of our human spirit. 
I am a young man from China, open up the computer this morning, Steve Jobs found dead, and I feel incredible sorrow and subtle, although the death of a business genius, but his spirit will inspire young people to some of the Jobs all the way, your spirit will last forever. I wish his family as soon as possible out of the pain.
Earlier this night in Norway, it was confirmed that Steve Jobs has  passed away - few seconds later, big doses with salty water is popping  out of my eyes... It's so touching to read about all the people who will  miss him! So I said to myself: tonight, it's not wrong to cry.  So will these word go through my mind - rest in peace, Steve Jobs. 
Steve certainly changed my life with all he did and I feel thankful for all his creativeness.&nbsp;
Steve inspired generations of creative thinkers to think differently.  Thank you Steve for turning an industry on its head. 
Steve was an amazing Human being besides being a geniuos.  I wish all his family and friends will recover from his loss quickly  If  Steve was able to leave on every one of us a single seed, Im sure we can all create a better world and pay him back!    
He will be missed. He was a incredible guy.
My life changes with every good ideas of this genius. I hope he will inspire every one in the world. My condolences to his family. &nbsp;Rest in peace Steve.
i think my life changed because of apple ! it is hard for me too believe mr jobs gone. i wish peace for him and i expect apple continue being best because i thing it was mr jobs wish! maybe he is not between us but his memory and his way of thinking can  help us to reach to his goal.    
Although I never met you, I felt you knew who I was , what I needed and how to get me excited. Life will never be the same, farewell my dear friend God speed.
Great Person has a Great Life You are still Alive Deep In My Heart&nbsp;
We will miss u buddy we love you god bless u!! &nbsp;
Steve Jobs has been called a modern-day da Vinci, and I benefited   from it just by having the good luck of being born when he was alive.  Rest in infinite peace, Steve Jobs, and thank you. You are my hero.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  I would like to THANK YOU for everything you've done for mankind... I've been able to work more efficiently, communicate better &amp; stay closer with my family &amp; friends because of your inventions.&nbsp;  You truly are a modern day Thomas Edison. I am sad that you're gone. I am sad that we would no longer see you up there on that stage introducing new gadgets... I am sad that this world has lost a true genius! May you rest in eternal peace.. we will sorely miss you, Steve!  THANK YOU! Until we meet again...
Goodbye, genius. 
A feeling of profound sadness came over me reading about Mr. Jobs.    It must be an extremely sad day for his family, my prayers are with them.   I hope they have the strength to persevere through this dark time and come to celebrate the impact he had on so many lives.      God speed Mr. Jobs.
Dear Steve,&nbsp; You undoubtedly&nbsp;the most&nbsp;influential&nbsp;man in technology in this century. I wished that I would have met you in person. You inspire me to be the best that I can be everyday of my life. I may only be 15 years old in a rural Pennsylvanian town, but I wish that you found Nirvana, and that somehow I will be able to meet you after this crazy ride called life.
We are all deeply moved by the passage of the most brilliant mind of technology of our times. We are sure as human being he was even more fantastics, as father, a husband a family man a boss.  May God bless you all from Apple Family, and we know Lord Jesus is waiting him along with Budha, Gandhi, Madre Tereza, Einstein, and all great human beings who have made our lives better doing their their job with passion and love.  Steve is live forever! &nbsp;
Our prayers go out for Steve's family, I am sure he will surely be  missed by millions. Now he is in heaven and no longer in any pain. Here's hoping Steve Jobs has an iPhone for God
I live my life the way I do because of Steve Jobs. His passion,  dedication, and love of his work inspired me like no other person in my  short life. I'm 21 and in my final year of school studying film, which I love more  than anything else. Everyday I beat myself up over tedious frustrations  or creative blocks that hinder my studies and work. But I suppose I  create those myself, because I'm driven to create amazing, inspiring,  incredible work. Everything I do, I want to love it. If I don't love it,  I don't move on. By the time I finish something, it has been a long and  tough battle. But everything I did to get there has been worth it.  Because I always love the end result.  This is because of Steve, because of his vision, his intent to succeed  and wow, and create the best. He will be immortalized as a cultural and  technological pioneer, and his influence will be felt throughout the  world forever.  Thanks for everything, Steve.
I'll admit it, I've got a homebuilt computer dual booting Linux and Windows and I don't own a single Apple product.  However, Apple has lost a true visionary without whom the world of technology, as it exists today, would be a different place.  Rest in Peace, Steve. 
As I am typing this from my iPod..I am trying to put my head around the impact Steve Jobs had on the world. And I can't, it would take something like a computer to do such a VAST and incredible task as to measure all of what he has done, and luckily, thanks to him, personal computers took off and we could all do such a feat. Everyone who buys music today or has an iPod or Mac or  some kind of apple device (and who doesn't) has been touched by him. He was  the counter-culture generation's true genius, an Edison of our time, I think he even surpasses him. A loss of a great mind.
Another GENIOUS MIND left us....
You don't realize how much you admire and have been touched by someone until they are gone, forever.  Steve Jobs is a true American success story and one of the best human beings of our time, of all time.  Rest in peace.  You will always be in our thoughts, our minds and in our lives every day.  No one wants to die but ... Death is a destination we all share...&nbsp;
My condolences go out to Steve's family. He will be missed by everyone.  I have been using the Iphone since it hit the market and am waiting for  the iphone 5. He has made my life more easy to manage with the iphone. RIP Steve 
Today we lost a visionary, an inventor, a genius, and an inspiration on so many levels to me and many I know. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs, your legacy and contributions will live on forever.
i heard about Steve's death, He was a genius and an inspiration for me! RIP my idol ! 
Just wanted to say that Steve Jobs was one of the most innovative and creative minds of the past 30 years in my books. The direction he put Apple in has landed the company where it is today at the forefront of technological advancement. While I don't miss him in the personal sense, I am certainly appreciative of the positive impact this man had on the world through both his entrepreneurial spirit and selfless giving. 
I had the pleasure of meeting Steve while working on a partnership with NeXT in the early 90s. The best story from my career is Steve demoing a little NextStep app of mine to a full government auditorium in Washington. It didn't even crash :-)  His ability to understand people and situations, and really try to help, was truly inspirational!  His family is in my prayers. 
He was an inspiration to all. My son launched his website today. I know Steve Jobs inspired him in all his efforts. The world has lost the ultimate visionary for our times. 
I honestly don't know what to say right now. I'm kind of in shock. Steve, you will be missed. Thanks for all the cool stuff, and thank you for teaching me some valuable life lessons through your life and work. I'm deeply saddened by your passing, but I take consolation in the fact that you were able to realize your long-term vision of what Apple (and technology) could be. May you haunt the hallways of the new Cupertino campus :)  Rest in peace, my friend.
Mr. Jobs,  Thank you for everything you have brought to us. Honestly, I dont think I could live without my ipod (im on my 3rd :! ) I love your products and appreciate everything you have done for this world. Thank you again, and may you Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
few have changed the world more ... i try harder every day because of his vision.. 
We will miss you Steve!!! You made a positive difference in the world.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs made this world a better place. He pushed civilization further down the road of progress. I have never been more saddened by the death of someone I never knew. When the whole world stops to mourn your death, you know you changed it. RIP Steve Jobs. You will be missed.&nbsp;
I envy everyone that had the opportunity to work with this amazing man. He was one of my idols due to his innovative spirit and determination. R.I.P Steve and my condolences to his family, friends and all of the Apple corporation. We lost a huge human being I feel sorry for us who never got to know him.
Time is short. What matters is what we do with the time we are given. Steve Jobs, in just 56 short years, made his contribution to this world in a way few could have. And he achieved it without losing sight of that which is most important, his family and close friends.Truly a legacy we can all aspire to.
Steve has made a big difference in me. Last year I did a report on him. I learned really cool facts about him.  Steve will always be remembered.  R.I.P. Steve Jobs&nbsp;
 All the best to the family and friends, its difficult to find the wright words for moments like these. Be strong!!!!!!!!
Steve Jobs fought a war with mediocrity and won. He's been an inspiration to entrepreneurs and creators everywhere...  His work inspired me... His resilience inspired me... His pursuit of perfection inspired me....  That pursuit of perfection culminated in the iPhone without which there would be no personal inspiration to build a company around it, no iFund to invest in it, no passionate people who loved Apple products and the same desire to perfect that Steve Jobs embodied.  Steve Jobs literally changed my life. I will miss his undeniable, influence on the world.  Thanks Steve.
Steve,  You enriched the lives of millions. When I first fell in love with the iPod, no one in Islamabad, Pakistan knew about it. I would get to buy one technology product during the year and as soon as I saw it, I knew this was it. Your creative genius was unparallelled. Thank you for working so hard to bring such great products to our lives. You were a cut above the rest.  May your soul rest in peace.
 The world lost a rare genius today; one that was able to bridge humanity and technology with true innovation. Apple products are technology with soul, and I expect that could also describe its creator. Too short, but a life that deeply influenced the lives of others.  Mr. Jobs, I feel lucky to have lived in the time in history that you touched.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs wasnt only the creater of apple he was a friend,a normal person that did something good for human kind. Steve hasnt die yet becuase i still going to remember him in my heart like everyone will. Apple i want to know if with every apple product bought online you can send a photo of Steve with it.&nbsp;
just can't believe it. The world lost Steve Jobs. There is no other way to put it. The world lost Steve Jobs.  Can you imagine where we would be without him?  He truly changed the world.  Thank You!  R.I.P Steve    Sent from my beautiful iMac   "… the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.” - Steve Jobs    
Words can't explain the sadness over Steve Jobs' passing. RIP to a brilliant innovator and businessman.
Thanks for all the fish, and thanks for answering my email. A hugely busy guy who answers email.  You rock Steve!&nbsp;
To the Jobs who I really admire...&nbsp;
He will be remembered forever as the man who revolutionized technology. RIP.
Steve,  You've been a great example as how to stand up and fight till the end! 
Always been a huge fan of Apple, since 84' have been working and admiring Job's creations and evolution.
I have been around Apple Macintosh most of my life. My Father has always been 'into' Apple since the beginning, always telling me that PC's were just a bunch of 'gimmicks'. My father, like Steve, was a bit of an eccentric, always  trying new ideas and creating these crazy projects in the garage. It was no  surprise to see our first Mac, the PowerPC, in the office when I turned 17.  I was so blown away by the ease of use, the OS, the different way of thinking, the innovation. To make a long story short, I have been an Apple junky since, I purchased  the 1st gen iMac when I started College, studying Graphic Design, using pre historic Photoshop and Illustrator apps. Fast Forward 14 years and 4 more Macs, 3 iPods, and a few iPhones, and I am still holding strong to my Apple roots. Thank you Steve Jobs, without your genius, innovation, and perseverance , where would the world be today?&nbsp;
Apple folks,  Deaths rarely move me to tears, yet this death... so many of my passions have been made accessible because Steve Jobs chose to dream, create then share.   I think this is worth sheding a tear.  Forgive me, if I shed more than one.  I don't know if my world is better, but it is so much cooler!  Steve, thank you, godspeed and may your family, friends, co-workers and employees know the peace that only time can bring.   You thought differently and changed the world.&nbsp;
            I am so sad that Steve Jobs left us. But he will not suffer anymore. I hope his spirit helps the people left behind to cope and help the   company to even greater heights. R.i.P. Steve. Thanks for everything.
Feeling So bad right now I just saw the news im just a kid from panama  obsessed with apple the last product i bought was an ipad 2 for my  birthday we lost my hero all my sorries to his family RIP STEVE
Dear Steve,   I know this isn't you who is reading this, but I dearly hope you  somehow can see this. I just want to say thank you. Thank you for  everything. Thank you for inspiring me. Thank you for being an  inspiration for many others. Thank you for changing the world. Steve, I hope you may rest in peace.&nbsp;
In a world where technology is more indispensable to our daily lives and  connects us to each another more closely than human beings have ever  been, Steve Jobs could see farther to the horizon than any of us.  Maybe  he won't be around in the years to come, but where we're going, he has  already been.  What we will be doing, he has already seen.  Thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
My condolences to the family of Steve Jobs. I am an Apple devotee because of  the simplicity of operating Apple products. The world has lost one of the g reatest contributors to society. The family has lost a husband, father, sibling and friend.&nbsp;
Having been not only a long time employee for Apple but also an enthusiast of the company for years longer, I am having trouble at this moment even processing the news of Steve's passing. He was truly the Edison of our times.  I will regret never having had the opportunity to personally thank Steve for the wonderful career I have had working for Apple and the many transformational experiences my time with Apple has provided. As a person, I have been enriched by each and every one.  To Steve: Thank you so much for your vision and your courage.  Thank you for allowing me to be a part of something bigger than myself, something worth believing in. Thank you.
It's not often that we feel a personal relationship to a CEO of a multi-billion dollar global company, most CEOs alienate us with their hunger for power or their incredulous wealth. Not so Steve Jobs. He was a visionary if there ever was one, a great leader, inspiring and energizing; and yet - he always seemed humble, approachable and, most of all, human.  I fear it will take a long time until the parting of a business icon will spark similar sadness in me.  Steve, I hope you're watching us from your own iCloud,  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I am so sad for this news
Thanks for a testament of will, resilience, and good taste.  Rest in peace.
Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.Mahatma Gandhi We all should pray and acknowledge this great soul, which brought light to the darkness of the technology of the world. We all learned from him and we all were entertained by Aplenty devices. What would we be without him?&nbsp;
Steve Changed the World One Idea At A Time.  His ideas changed my life. Not because of insanely great products.  But because he never lost sight of his dreams and taught us by example that we can choose to follow ours.  Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
A day to say goodbye to a person who had both the strength and talent to make a lasting difference. Steve Jobs gave us gifts to live wonderful moments with the people we love. An inspiring man.
A visionary of technology and business has past....RIP Steve Jobs. &nbsp; Your legacy lives on!  
Please accept my condolences.  He was among people who really change the world. I hope he endowed you the best values - spirit of creating new  human-friendly tech world. Don't disappoint us please! &nbsp;Happy journey with Mac into future since 1995. 
 You guys may or may not read this. But the world didn't just loose a great human being, it lost one of the most important, smart men of all time. The apple's apple just lost a piece of it's seed. Earth has just lost a piece of it's beauty.             
In their lives, many people see the world change. Not many people, in  their lives, change the world. To Steve Jobs, the man, the innovator,  and living symbol of the American Dream who inspired us all. Though you  lie at rest, the ideas, words, and actions you took in life will live on  in the generations that follow as an eternal testament to what you have  done for all of humanity. In the time you had, you chose to use the  talents at hand to shape the future and make the world a better place.  Thank you again for being the inspiration, pioneer, and leader you were  and the symbol you now have now become. Rest In Peace. 
I think many of us grew up watching Steve as an innovator turned creator  and then as the leader of one of the most amazing companies to ever  emerge.  Many will say it better but Steve's vision and pursuit of  excellence not only revolutionized Apple, but has changed the world in  many ways.  His loss is sad and it will be a long time getting over but  my hope is the seeds he planted will continue to produce a bountiful  harvest in the world for decades to come.
You literally changed the world and the world will miss you. 
Thank you, Steve, for making it so easy for me to learn how to use a computer 25 years ago after I had grown up in the 60's &amp; 70's with a Remington typewriter. Thank you, Steve, for making everyone believe that you don't have to be afraid of New Technology. Most of all, thank you for enriching our lives with your vision...may you rest in peace... 
You are my teacher. A guide. I will miss you. 
Today we lost someone who really changed the world for many.  I want to thank you for making my life easier and more fun with your  inventions.  I hope you rest in peace, where ever you are! You will be remembered forever! &nbsp;
Condolence. Thank you Steve Jobs for the great work that you shared to all of us.
The most innovating man ever. Thanks steve not only have you inspired me, but you and apple have helped me to accomplish my dreams&nbsp;
The world has lost a great man.   
My sympathies go out to all your friends and family everywhere! You will be sadly missed!&nbsp;
I grew up a PC man. We've had a PC in the house since 1982, my dad worked almost his entire career for a PC company. In those days, Mac was the enemy. Now, I'm strictly a Mac Man. My house looks like a MacMall catalog. &nbsp;Why? What made me change? Machines that work. Technology with the end user in mind. &nbsp;Quality in a product that is unheard of in the rest of the industry. A marriage of design, quality and innovation. Steve Jobs did all that. &nbsp;He will be missed.
Dear Mister Jobs,  You really did wonderful things down here!  I hope you will find peace up there!&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to his family. Steve Jobs changed and moved the world. I don't believe it would be what it is right now if it wasn't for Jobs. He opened the field for new players, but he invented the game. You will definitely be missed.  
Steve was a inspiring leader also here in a farming area next to the Patagonia.  I will tell futures generation about how he did it and why.  He was a tech-hero.
 ... Un grand merci pour son oeuvre et son génie. Une pensée à sa famille et ses proches. RIP Steve !&nbsp;
I'm only fourteen, but the impact he has had is amazing I hope to be  like him. Long live innovation R.I.P. Steve Jobs He will forever live on  through his amazing creations ideas and philosophy. 
We won't forget you, Steve. Your dedication on innovative works will  always be at our memories forever.&nbsp;
 To the family of Steve Jobs,  My sincerest condolences to the entire Job's family. I never had a chance to meet Steve or work with him, but it was always something I wish I could have done. Words can not express what you have lost today nor can words help ease the pain. Take solace in knowing Steve is in a better place and he will always be with you.&nbsp;
Wow!!   This is very sad news.  He seemed to be not only a creative genius but a very humble man.    Prayers are being sent to his family and remembering his graceful fight against this terrible disease.
Dear Steve,  I consider myself extremely lucky to have witnessed the great rise of a brilliant and legendary thinker. Thank you, Steve, for everything from your iP(roducts), to the birth Pixar, to the revolutionizing of digital music. It breaks my heart to see you go, although I know that what you have done in your 56 years of life will keep you alive. You truly were a genius.  Again, thank you.&nbsp;
 Steve's Quote:  "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future," he told Stanford University graduates during a commencement speech in 2005. "You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life."  What Steve's quote means to me:  So then, I choose to believe in me by fueling my life with my gut in hope of meeting my destiny.  By doing so, I hope to live a better life for others, so karma will afford me the opportunity to a broader destiny in whatever.  Have a safe journey Steve.
 Hello good evening, I am a Brazilian woman of only 18 who, like many, was a fan ofSteve Jobs.  Steve was one of the men, in my view, more intelligent than ever. A true genius of computing. Founder of Apple, could revolutionize what we call technology. Produced asecurity system for your business and unique never seen before. With Steve, Apple has managed to become the most valuable company in the world. And even battling an illness for years managed to change the world with its simple technology that everyoneadmires. I never tire of saying Steve Jobs is a genius. His death was shocking.  One of my biggest dreams was to meet Steve, who knows one day I can make the world what he did. Steve has always been and always will be my biggest inspiration and I still hope and dream of one day being able to know the largest computer company in the world and its current president.  Brazil, for Apple.  Thank you.  * Sorry for my English, if not very good but I struggled the most.   
You forever changed the way I listen to music as well as communicate with the world around me. Your ingenuity and creativity will be missed. Thank you. Confucius say..."Everything has it's beauty but not everyone sees it." 
I'm sitting in our backyard sipping on a hot cup of tea checking my emails and reading the sad news on my iPhone of Steve passing.  My 14-year-old daughter is busy on her Mac, doing homework. My husband is checking on his business on his iPad2 He sure made our lives easier. The world is missing him already and pray for his family at these sad days. Thank you for giving a chance to write.
He was a great man. He will surely be missed. What happens is for the best. We should all do what he would want us to do. Make APPLE the company that can put a smile on anybodies' face when the hold an APPLE product. Stand strong. Once in a while everybody needs to cry. Do so. Soon after that sadness will turn to joy.                                   WE LOVE YOU STEVE YOU WILL BE MISSED
Thinking different since 1955. Thank you. 
My deepest condolences goes to the family of our dear mr Steve Jobs. May god comfort the family, and to Apple, u may have lost a great man, mentor and leader of the company, but remember, his legacy will still live on! All the best!
My condolences to the Jobs' family and employees and friends.  Mr. Jobs was such a blessing to the world.  May he rest in peace.
 My prayers goes to your family and your fellow colleagues. :(&nbsp;
Can you imagine where we would be today without all of Steve's visions?      RIP Steve.  Prayers go out to your family.
I will remember the incredible force that steve was not only to apple but to the world, he made amazing advances and efforts to make our world a place we could live effortlessly and made it possible to enjoy the little things in life and in work.   Since I was 9 steve gave me a broader look to the simple world I lived in and the immense paths and turns our lifes can take, I will always have steve as part of me and be incredibly grateful to his impressive life.   Lets remember steve as the great entrepreneur, visionary and person he was. I'll be forever thankful.  thanks you for your time   -
An innovator, a visionary, focused and committed making technology accessible to the world. I feel lucky to be part of the generation that experienced his magic!&nbsp;
Steve, you were an inspiration making the things of dreams. Thank you. 
Thank you for your vision, your passion and your clear message.  We should all dream to deliver uniqueness, usefulness and do our best to make the world a better place. "Live so that when your children think of fairness and integrity, they think of you." H. Jackson Brown, Jr.     
In this century one can  count on one hand the people who have had a major influence on the history and diredtion of personal computing, and Steve was one of them.  Sadly missed but his dream and vision will continue, as well as his legacy.  I am old enough to remember the first Apples made in the garage and the journey into the current day.  My heart goes out to his family who would have known of his illness and the need for secrecy.  Thanks Steve for everything&nbsp;
Thanks, Steve!  I began computing with the Mac 128K in 1984 and have been an Apple exclusive user ever since.  I've built an academic career focused on using computers for foreign language learning and it remains a passion.  The Apple has inspired me, delighted me and supported me through all these years.  I thank you for your vision, your creativity and your inspiration.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
 As an avid Mac user, all I can ever say is thank you.    Thank you for imagination. Thank you for strength. Thank you for genius. &nbsp;A greatness that is irreplaceable.  You will be missed.
You defined my generation. You will be missed. R.I.P.   
Anyone who is a fan of Apple must feel as I do,  that we have lost a friend. 
         You were amazing! Rest in peace. 
Steve:  Although you and I have never personally meant, You have won customer for life and nothing will change that. Millions of your fans will never forget about your vision and what you have done! You will be truly missed  Rest in Peace
  I love Apple. I love All your art.  Please rest in peace.   Thanks you very very much!&nbsp;
Steve has been an inspiration to us all.  Keeping us in suspense as we waited for the next IPhone or IPad.  Apple products are the best and we are proud  to carry them!  A true genius, Steve will be missed and remembered through his creativity and ability to deliver technology and products that we all want and love.  I send my condolences to his family as we all grieve and will miss him so much!
Mr.Steve  I appreciate having been born to the same time as you.  Thank you for the highest entertainment.  Please rest slowly.&nbsp;
To the Jobs family and Apple corporation, my heart goes out for the loss of this great man. His vision for life has truly been an example for me and everyone who is astonished for his love to follow. His spirit and energy will forever be a part of the reason why we never give up on ourselves and our dreams of being &nbsp;writers. Partly because of Steve Jobs I now believe and see the dots connecting in our lives, thanks so much Steve for being our hero.&nbsp; &nbsp;With love and compassion
Today the world lost a giant of a man!  Steve  - your passion, your commitment to excellence, your innovative mind have absolutely made my life so much better!  Thank you for your courage to pursue your dreams! You will be sorely missed.  The world is a better place because of you!
Dear Apple,  I am a 30 year music professional.  I consider my Apple computer to be   an instrument, not just a tool.  I am so very thankful for Steve and   Apple's commitment to the arts and the technology surrounding music   specifically.  Steve has the created the classic American company and the classic   American product. We should all be proud of this accomplishment.  I am very sorry for your loss and you have my deepest sympathies..  Sincerely and with deepest respect.     
Myself, my friends and family are all deeply saddened by this news. Steve Jobs did what no one else has ever done and he'll be remembered forever.&nbsp;
May all hail and give thanks for the life and gifts of the late, great Steve  Jobs who changed the world. He changed it as much as did Thomas Edison or Henry Ford. And he added immeasurably to my enjoyment of life. V
Hi there,  Just want to send out my condolences to both Mr. Jobs' family and friends, and the Apple company.  He was an amazing inspiration to all of us, and had a direct influence on me through his speech at his 2005 Stanford commencement speech.  May he rest in peace and may God forgive him for his sins and have mercy on him.  All the best to his family and their futures.
I knew he was sick, but was not expecting it to be this severe.  Few people have the ability to change the world in their entire lifetime, even fewer can change it multiple times. Steve was the rarest of them all.  Today we have lost a visionary, that changed the world multiple times. He will always be remembered.  May he Rest In Peace.
Thank you Steve Jobs.  You have forever changed the way I love tech.   Your innovation and genius will truly be missed.  Thank you. 
Rest in peace Steve,  you will be missed by family,friends,employees, and many millions of people whose lives you touched around the world.
Only two words say it all: Thank you. 
 Rest in peace. U will always be remembered and Your vision will be carried from generation to generation.   Respect  
You have changed the world and truly lived your life as if it was your last day! You are an inspiration to me and hopefully many many more like me. You will be greatly missed but your legacy will live on forever! You were our modern day Einstein and will be remember as such!  thank you! 
 Steve Jobs is a greate innovation leader and business genius. We enjoy our life with Apple everyday. Thank you Jobs!
Dear Steve, thank you for genius and humanity. You have contributed to the education and the enjoyment of millions on this world and your legacy will continue to do so. Rest in peace my friend, you will be sorely missed!
To Family &amp; Friends,  I'm truly saddened by his loss and I felt compelled to convey my profound condolences to his immediate family and fellow workers. I'm an avid user of many of your products and have always found Steve Jobs inspirational in a variety ways. I'm about the same age and, without getting into details, have followed the 'Apple Story' since its inception. "Think Different', indeed.  A loyal fan of man and company.&nbsp;
I remember when the first Apple product I owned was a lime green iPod Mini. I had that thing for about 2-3 years in elementary/middle school. By the time it broke, you guys had stop manufacturing them. I loved that thing so much. Sometimes more than my iPhone 3GS. :) Thank you Steve Jobs for the wonderful company you have produced and lead throughout the years. Your work will always be loved and well used. :) 
Apple and Mac computers and devices have been part of my life for over two decades. I recall good times and lean times. Steve Jobs returning to Apple and subsequently leading the company from the 'wilderness' to becoming the world's largest and best technology company is testament to both his creative and business genius. He was a truly unique individual and one of the greatest visionaries of our time.  R.I.P. Steve and Thank you! &nbsp;
May Steve's soul rest in peace.. 
                Dear Apple-er(s)     My condolences to all the people that have work with this genius man!!  The man who changed the world in such good ways;  The man who shared his magnificent work with us;  The man who undoubtedly will be talked about now, tomorrow, the weeks, months, years, decades and centuries to come;  The man who believed in something in a "different" way;  And the man whose work will live on!!!    THANK YOU STEVE JOBS!!!     And last, but certainly not leas I want to thank the whole Apple-team that believed in this person, because without a doubt your input and effort made Apple what it is today!!!  I believe in Apple and I believe in the people who will take his masterpiece to the next level.       THANK YOU AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;
Thank you Steve for all you did! From Russia with Love!!!!! 
I don't know who will read this email, thus, dear whoever reads it, Steve brought me an iPod that was finally enough for my music, which I have been using for more than 5 years and thousands songs. And he then brought me a Macbook Air that I could take it with me anywhere, and I am typing with it now. IPhone is definitely the best cell phone I've ever used. I guess even last night my parents played games together on the iPad. Is iPhone 4S iPhone for Steve?  It should be. I just write to say thank you Steve! And my best wishes to his family!  Best.
As an employee of Apple it is because of Steve Jobs and because of his emphasis on aesthetics, engineering, interface, and most importantly, people, that brought me to to the company 5 years ago.  Steve epitomized the man I would like to someday become.  I read earlier today that more people are born on October 5 than any other day of the year.  In remembering the life of Steve Jobs, I find that incredibly fitting.&nbsp;
 My sincere condoleance to the family. Steve was  a great guy. My husband and  I have been Using Apple products since 1980.
Thank you Steve for making a dent in the universe.  I spent my first 2 1/2 years out of college working for your company and it was a truly formative experience in my life.  The culture that was nurtured and people and friends I had the pleasure to work along side were some of the best times of my young career.  You're vision and products changed my course in life more than I will ever truly realize.  I didn't know you personally, but I believe I'm not alone in saying that I always felt a kindred spirit in you.  Thank you.&nbsp;
  You were truly one of a kind. I write this using one of many  genius products you have provided the world with. I don't know you as a  human being but I can say you have left an impact on the world...we all  hope we can make that impact before we pass. See you on the other side.  MAY YOU REST IN PEACE.  
Mrs. Jobs, I'm a new Apple user and am sorry for your loss.  This is the  best computer I've ever owned.
I've never owned many Apple products, aside from my 8 gig iPod (which is brilliant) and I have never really given much thought to the Apple brand. Oddly, I still feel impacted by the passing of Steve Jobs. His innovations were a source of national pride and were a gift to the world. I may not be overly familiar with his products, but I am&nbsp;knowledgeable&nbsp;of his life and his work ethic. Jobs was the best of Henry Ford and Willy Wonka combined. My condolences to his family and friends.&nbsp; 
Steve, beyond being the inspiring business guy / technology visionary / independent thinker,   you are more than inspiring in your bravery facing the ultimate challenge, your mortality.  Even as you pass, you continue to lead with your quiet passing.  May you rest in peace and be encountering even more positive challenges!
Steve Jobs has not only changed peoples lives by his technological  advances, but he has always stayed very personable to the people.  Steve's face and brilliant ideas will be missed with us all.
My heart cry out and the world has just lost an amazing jewel. 
I am shocked! Then I cried. Steve is my hero and my model, inspiring me to pursue my dream and follow my heart. Best wishes to his families and God bless.&nbsp;
My condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.&nbsp; I shed a few tears when I heard a news, saddened that an era has ended.&nbsp; Thank you to Steve and Apple for all the great innovations and products that I and the world now enjoy. &nbsp;&nbsp;
 Thank you for your creativity and vision. Thanks to you we can keep in contact with our family through FaceTime everyday, which makes us feel closer despite the distance across the Atlantic. RIP Steve Jobs.
Hello Apple team,  Today is a sad day, Steve has been called by god and in his new place,  he will continue with his great job, now next to the creator.  God bless and receive to Steve, we will remember you every day!!  Many thanks to all.
We do not often see nor realize the accomplishments and brilliance of individuals prior to their demise. History normally reveals our past geniuses years after we've lost them and had time to ponder their gifts to our evolution. Steve Jobs was a rare exception to a class of innovators that have been able change how we live our lives.  We should only be as fortunate as he. Steve, we thank you for your vision, realization, and most of all, your ability to move a planet.&nbsp;
I never met Steve - and I sent him an email too late in his too-short  life for him to reply. It's okay though, that he never got to reply to  it. It's a fond reminder - maybe in a way more so than if he had written  me back. Now I get to wonder what he would have said.  I am a huge Apple fan of course, but even if I weren't I think everyone  could say that he made our lives better - he spurred on competition and  a rising tide floats all the boats.  I am sure he is so, so missed. I miss him as a visionary and a force for  the future, but he was a man, with family and friends. I hope they are  well and take comfort that so many are thinking of them, as I am.&nbsp;
I'd like to say that, just like happened with the whole world, you've changed my life. Not only with gadgets and devices, but with ideas and ways of thinking. You shall be remembered forever. As a genius. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
 I have never met Mr. Jobs but I remember hearing his name while  I was growing up. I remember when the first iPod was announced, the  first iPhone, the first iPad and he was always there to usher the device  into a new era. Apple is truly one of the most revolutionary companies  the world has ever seen and there will probably never be another company  that comes close to the magnificent family Steve Jobs molded it to be.  I'm really going to miss Jobs, but what he has created will last way  beyond any of our lifetimes and his name will surely resonate throughout  time. My condolences to his friends and family, and thank you.
My first computer that I would use was an Apple IIe.  After that, I insisted, begged, my mom to buy a Apple IIc, and she did.  I knew then that Apple would change our lives.       Thank you Steve - I will miss you.
 I can't believe this! I'm crying! Steve changed my life and everyone's.. I've no words to describe how I feel right now.. Please make heaven really sweet . All my love from an Argentinian fan&nbsp;
 Dear Apple Family,  I never met Steve. And I was never in a room when he spoke. But every  time I turn on my Apple computer and hear the classic gong, then see the  classic bite from the Apple, I feel Steve's presence like a brother.  Never, never again will the soul of man-made object be so fused with its  creator.  I grew up with Apple, and, therefore, grew up with Steve and his  relentless pursuit to make me a computer that thought like me. I truly  felt Steve worked for me, created for me, designed for me. His  leadership of the company was simply that personal.  To those of you fortunate to call Steve your friend, my deepest and most  heartfelt sympathy. You are indeed blessed for having been so close to  him.
I will tell my grandkids, I'm proud that I lived in the "Age of  Steve Jobs". Thank you Steve. You changed my life forever.
Thank you Steve. You have been an inspiration.  I have been an Apple advocate since my Apple IIe many years ago. You have changed the way we work and think.  Thank you. You will be remembered.
Thank you Steve for making our lives better.&nbsp;
Just heared it on TV, can't believe it.  The world lost one of the most beautiful minds, a person that can be described, at least, as a genius, for the ones who only have seen his work on Apple. I'm sure that he was (is) that, and many other things.  My condolences to the family and friends, and any other who is sorry for this lost.  May now his mind rest in peace. 
Just wanted to say thanks for making our household technology so much  easier to use.  A visionary with a grasp of what ordinary people want. You will be missed. 
Thanks Steve for being an inspiration to the world.  Mere mortals with a clear vision truly can make a dent in the Universe.&nbsp;
Today the world has lost a great man, my condolences to his family.
   Aside from the technological advances, Steve made good design cool. He gave it prestige and a monetary value. As a designer I am endebted to him and his design team at Apple for giving good design (from interfaces to logos to advertising) prestige. He made it art. Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was not just a man, an inventor, a teacher or a business man.  steve created a whole new life to modern technology. He created a  lifestyle. He may just be the prime example of the evolution of mankind. Enough was never enough. Steve Jobs IS a mastermind.
Steve was&nbsp;inspiration and simplified my life.
I've been a Windows shop throughout my life. After switching to iMac and iPhone, my way of working has changed. It has been simplified. Steve is a true visionary and a legend. 
Though I never met the man, I truly loved him. Steve Jobs' vision and dreams have touched my soul since I experienced an Apple IIc in grade school. Apple has been my choice for as long as I can remember. From our 2 Apple TVs, my desk's iMac, my wife's MacBook Air, my MacBook I'm typing on, the many iPods and iPhones I've bought for us, not to mention the five shuffles I bought as groomsmen gifts, I can't see a life without the touch and influence of Mr. Jobs. My only regret is that I never had the honor of shaking the man's hand and thanking him face to face for the luxury of knowing and loving the products he created. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. You're already missed. Thank you for everything, sir.&nbsp;
Steve paved the way for a brand new generation of techies, techies that  can carry our computers in our pockets and anywhere we want.  I for one,  won't take lightly the opportunity he gave to this generation.&nbsp;
I'm sad to hear about Steve's death, as an Apple fan for years and son of a cancer survivor, I still find this news hard to believe.  I just want to give my most sincere condolences to his family and friends.  I hope Steve will guide and enlighten future CEO's from heaven. &nbsp;
Steve said that you can only connect the dots looking back. With his loss, the duty to honor his memory and continue to make his vision come true fall into the company leaders. May you have the serenity and wisdom to do well. May he rest in peace. 
 One of the greatest geniuses of modern computing - Steve&nbsp;Jobs.I would like to give your family my deepest condolences and Godbless.If anyone at Apple with less than half of his genius, the Company will be well.Stay in Peace, Steve!    
It is sad to hear that our great hero in this period left us. He is a visionary, great and creative man who was, is and will be pushing the human being forward. He gives this generation lots of beautiful gifts which only Zen can guide us to invent. He also teaches how to follow our own hearts and intuition to change the world. His great achievement will be remembered generation by generation.   Please receive my great wishes to you and your children.
My deep condolences for the greatest mind of the history....  Thank you very much for your contribution to the world!
I'm really shocked - that is too early - right!?  Thank you for everything you've created for this world. My kids will live in the future you've shaped.&nbsp;
I grew up in a house that always had apple computers. Every day of my 21  years I have enjoyed apple built products. I always listened to my dad  talk how much of a genius Steve Jobs was. Upon graduating from high  school I bought my own MacBook, and about 2 months ago I bought my  iPhone 4, and I can't imagine going through college and work without  them. Steve Jobs was a phenomenal visionary, and I'm very sad to see him  go. My most sincere condolences and prayers go to his family and the  Apple family. Thanks for everything Steve. 
I have been using Apple products since 1982. The driving vision behind those products has been Steve Jobs. The world has truly lost a visionary. I am deeply saddened.&nbsp;
One simple word .... GENIUS !!!   Apple isn't only one company, but one brand of art ! &nbsp;
No one, nowhere, and never has someone had such a positive impact on masses of people worldwide.  Put quite simply, Steve Jobs made life fun!!  I became fascinated with computers after seeing the Apple II, and although I could not afford one back then, I yearned for the time that I could do so.  Once I had my first Apple, the Macintosh, there was no going back.  What an amazing world Steve created for us computer lovers!  You will forever be missed. Because of you, being a geek became honorable.  I hope that you left some good smattering of inspiration and showered those around you with major sprinklings of your creativity.  Godspeed, my forever friend.   
I began as an Apple owner from the Apple IIe days. Since that time, I have owned more than a dozen Macs, and provided   computer support for networks of Macs at the companies I worked for   more than 10 years. Steve was one of those guys whom I never met personally, but who had   inspired and influenced me (and my family) more than any other single   person I have ever had the opportunity to know. He was a true genius and his brilliance in recognizing the potential   of computers and digital media is without equal. He will be greatly missed, and I wish his family my deepest sympathy.  Good journey, Steve 
  DEAR   I AM SO SORRY HEAR THAT JOBS HAS GONE   BUT HE WILL STILL ALIVE ON MY HEART,I AM KINDLY WHISH HAPPINESS OF YOUR FAMILY.   GOOD LUCK
RIP. Farewell Steve Jobs. The world is a less smart, elegant and insanelly creative place tonight!!!
I am deeply sorry to hear that Steve's time was cut short because he loved, and was loved by so many.  I don't know what else to say.&nbsp;
One day I dreamed about a World full of magic. In that world we could listen to ours favorite songs while playing games and chat with other friends. In that world I saw a Doctor consulting a book with a device thin as a paper tissue. I saw a boy watching cartoons in his bed at night and smiling that he was up a long past bed time. Mr. Jobs you made my world of magic come true. Today as a Medical Student I can check about peculiarities of diseases in only a few touches, I can watch Movies in my bed while I'm on duty, I can talk with my mom, dad and Girlfriend while I'm surfing on the web ... and all of this just because your creativity and hard work gave the world the iPhone.  Rest in Peace and I really hope that Apple continues to grow, so my future kids can enjoy all the magic that is in Technology. 
I was born in 1984, and between my family and I, we have owned literally dozens of Apple computers since we bought our first Macintosh 128k.  I have never even owned a Windows device.  Never had a reason to purchase an inferior product.  Thanks, Steve.  You were a pioneer and a personal hero.  You will be missed.
 I looked forward that one day I would be able to meet Steve Jobs, but now that's just a dream. He has changed the way we use technology and also has changed the way we live. He will be missed.            
To Mr. Job's Family and the Apple Company,  It is with great sadness that I learned of the passing of such an  inspirational and creative person. He has truly made an important gift  to the world, and has brightened my life with his products and his  personal story. 
Your life inspired me. I will change the world.
Steve Jobs, the most brilliant man in the world. You will be missed...but you will be alive in all of us forever.
To know you is to merely look at the way my toddlers learn. On the iPad. I never met you but you are forever a part of my daily life and my children's generation. Rest in Peace. May your friends rejoice in the time you had and carry on the memory.&nbsp;
As I remember way back in the 80's my very first computer was an Apple IIe I was only 8 years old and at that age I was profoundly hooked learning the ways of using a computer. This is in very essence the road I took to becoming what I am now. My world revolves around computers and electronics devices and it is my goal to provide people with the tools the need to achieve their objectives. I think that gave me the tools to accomplish that goal. If you look at all the computers, handhelds and even the operating system in some way it reflects the work of a man that envision his ideas into what make thing work. I believe that this is not a loss but a new beginning. There will be many others that will rise up to the challenge and be creative like Steve to make innovation like he did. My condolence to the family and friend that where close to Steve and to the company that he leaves now in good hands and my thanks to Steve for putting me into path that was at very core my calling to be an Engineer in Information technologies.&nbsp;
Steve was so bold and never afraid to play where others wouldn't. He was a Brave hero with a huge  legacy!&nbsp;
I bought my first apple product in 2007, the first generation iPhone. I was not an Apple fan till then, though I was aware of Mr. Jobs and how he had rescued Apple from hard times in the 1990s. I can remember watching the 2007 keynote in which the first iPhone was introduced, and he spoke with such gravitas that since then I have associated only one man with one company: Steve Jobs and Apple. No other successful company had such a living icon at the helm...I missed his presence at the keynote this year, his sage, confident words strangely absent. Apple is Steve Jobs, inside and out, and as Walter Cronkite once said "There won't be another Walt Disney..." ...there won't be another Steve Jobs.  Rest in Peace, God Bless you and your family.&nbsp;
My condolences to the Jobs' family and Apple, Inc., the world is mourning the loss of one of the worlds greatest innovators. Steve Jobs, you have profoundly changed the world and my life for the better. Your legacy will live on for generations and the world will be forever indebted to your technological genius. Thank you for everything. May You Rest in Peace in Heaven. 
Thank you not just for my iPod, iPhone, Macbook Pro, iPad, and Apple TV, but for changing the world and the way we live.  Ironically I learned of Steve's passing as a breaking news alert notification on my iPhone.  This is a sad day for us all, but my condolences go out to Steve's family and friends.  We truly lost a once in a generation visionary.  I know that apple will continue on with Steve's vision and can't wait to see what's next!  I know it will be amazing.
I'm so, so, shocked, its a terrible lost for the world, he was a great man and genius, good bye Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Wow, I can't believe that he has finally gone. Although I never met him, let  alone even see him in person, he played a major role in my life. It is him and what he created that got me interested in computers in the first place. His genius and creativity will be greatly missed and felt around the world. I  think it is really something when tears can be shed for someone I have never met. May you rest in peace Steve, and if you are reading this, thank you for inspiring me to challenge myself. Thank you for all of your gifts to humanity. You started a revolution and your name will be known throughout the rest of our existence as a great person who helped us all advance more technologically than ever before.&nbsp;
Amazing...innovative... genius... pioneer... First words that come to  mind when you think of Mr. Jobs. The speech he gave at Stanford in 2005  was unforgettable and very inspiring. Thank you for everything you gave to the world. You will be deeply  missed.
Unique mind, unique heart, humanitarian, visionary, inspirational, fighter, survivor. He changed the world, he changed my world.  Every time I take my 42 year old  sister in law to Memorial Sloane Kettering Hospital in New York City, I take notes on her visits with her oncologist.  This technology Steve Jobs and Apple brought to their "fans" has made an amazing difference in what is the most difficult time in our lives.  This technology has enabled us to connect to this vicious Stage 4 Breast Cancer in a way that most survivors before 2 years ago could not.  Looking things up while the doctor speaks to us.  Ability to look at trials and new drugs and treatment at the literal tip of our fingers, right now, not waiting until we get home hours later.  iBooks to read while going through treatments. iTunes to buy new music to soothe our soul and warm our hearts while we wait for scan results. This is truly a sad day in my life.  Death is a destination we all share.
I got my first Apple IIc around 1983-84 and it was life changing then, I was trying to learn fortran.... 17 years later, it changed my life with editing on Final Cut Pro and making my 1st movie.... for the last 5 years I could not operate my life without an Apple. From my social networks to my personal business and everything in general. Thank you 1,000,000,000,000 times  rest in peace  god bless
All I can say is you're truly the best CEO of our time. Thanks for everything you've done to make the world's a better place, thank you. 
Steve Jobs was an inspiration and will be missed a lot. He leaves a void in the tech world. May his soul rest in peace and prayers for his family and his loved ones.&nbsp;
I am a recent college grad, and have watched the growth of the iPod through my lifetime. It has been incredible to see how much apple products have impacted, and enhanced our society. Watching Steve Jobs commencement speech on youtube has been an inspiration to me, as well as something that has served as  a motivating force. Thank you for the words of inspiration. "Stay young, stay foolish!". You will be missed...
Many thanks Jobs. Your life is My life. For ever. &nbsp;

Steve was a genius and I'm so sorry about his lost. We will miss him.  
 The World and Creativity will miss Steve Jobs .            
 I'm from Argentina. I'm just 16 years old so people might not think seriously about me and my thoughts but, I personally looked up to Steve Jobs. He was inspiring to me. I didn't get to know him very well, but I think he was one of the best kind of person in the whole world. I really don't know what to say right now... I'm really shocked and crying as I keep reading about him... Just wanted to say that he will be in my heart forever. Thanks for this space to let us say what we need to say.  REST IN PEACE STEVE JOBS.            
I feel silly writing this, but I think it will make me feel better.  I am profoundly saddened by this.  It's not like I knew him personally.  Yes, I do love Apple products.  But Steve was such a symbol of all that is right in the world, it's extremely difficult to not feel some sort of grief whether you liked his products or not.  He had a way with words and he will be missed.  He was a visionary who was taken away too soon and the entire world (not just the tech industry) will be rocked by this for years to come.  I am in school to become a scientist in the research/bio-pharmaceutical field.  Oncology has always been one of my main focuses for a multitude of reasons, and whenever I'm reminded of someone's life who has been touched by cancer I feel reaffirmed that I've made the right career choice.  Hopefully my efforts will one day help the future leaders of industry.  Rest in peace, Steve.
Hello,  I send out my condolences and respect for a great man.  A visionary.  He  shaped this world and gave it many great things.  He was part of the  most important revolution we have seen so far.  The revolution of  computers.  He will be missed but never forgotten.  I'll take a bite out  of an apple and salute it to him.
I was saddened to hear of Steve's death.  I got my first Apple IIe when I was 8. Learned to program games in Basic  at aged 10 so I could do cool stuff on the IIe and then of course I was  hooked...  My whole life and career has involved and frankly revolved around the  Mac and I would not be where I am today in business without the  incredible creation from the mind of Steve.&nbsp;
In a time of economic instability, Steve Jobs is proof positive of how  the American heritage is the best in human history. A young kid and his  friends ,in a garage, could change a whole global society with  technology that was his vision.  God Bless Steve and his legacy!  Thanks for all the great products.  Rest In Peace
"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish." ~ Steve Jobs. &nbsp;Thank you very much, Steve.  My heartfelt condolences to Steve's family, friends and Apple.&nbsp;
To the Family of Steve Jobs:  Thank you for allowing the world to borrow your husband, son, father and  friend. May God hold you in this hour.
Steve touched the life of so many, he will not be forgotten.&nbsp;
Steve,  I realize the meaning of design from you: less is more, and design makes life better. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
You will be missed as a humanitarian and visionary. Your technological wisdom will stand as a monument for many years to come.&nbsp;
*Apples changed the world*: One seduced Eve, One awakened Newton and. One was in the hands of Steve Jobs. RIP Steve Jobs, the man with the future on his head. 
To all people around the World. A few years ago I lost a friend in the same circumstances.  Same genius , same character.  He should get a statue on every corner of the Globe. Sincere condolences from Belgium.
My Deepest condolences  to all who love him. One Genius who changed the way we view the world.
Dear Steve,  Even though I'm not an Apple user, but your works are always be remembered. Thank you Sir, and keep creates something new along the way of your new path.
When I 1st saw him he was an inspiration and when I heard about him for the last time he was like a family member. Lost a friend who really made us think different.&nbsp;
RIP Steve jobs, you will be missed. You are a leader in technology. My condolences to your family and friends.
He changed the world in terms  of consumer electronics.  He will always be remembered when people hold &nbsp;Apple made products. 
Tragic loss of a man who changed my life in more ways than one. I could create a home office, and get to spend time with my family &amp; friends in Ireland. I've persistently used his simplicity in design when looking at my own product design. More importantly, it's doing what you believe in, and stuff the dictats of what is considered normal/crazy. He made it possible for so many of us to work differently, and then think differently. He created a zeitgeist more than once.  To all his family friends and teams, my sincere condolences.
Thank you Steve Jobs for giving us a vision of the future. You will be missed. I will start out with apple and end with apple! 
Too soon, too soon. I enjoy and owned many of the products that were a result of Steve's vision. I didn't know him, but I'm saddened that he is no longer with us.  Mac Addict For Life 
I am a Mac user since i was 18, this year i finally entered the dream  university, the gift from my parents is a Mac, iBook, I had a great time spent with it. Now i am a project manager in oil and gas industry, traveling around  the world with my MacBook, iPad, iPhone  Apple changed my way of life, thank you Steven, we love you.     
RIP Steve Jobs - you created the 4 most magical words " Sent from my iPhone"&nbsp;
I love you Steve Jobs. You have been an enormous inspiration to the world and me. You will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
I have no words to express at this moment, because no amount of words can describe the Sparkle and Genius of Jobs. I feel I am all alone in this world without Jobs.&nbsp;
I just want to say that Steve was and is truly an icon, innovator and inspiration. His brilliant eye for simplicity and creativity has made a mark in computing history. I know generations from now children will read about how he  started one of the most innovative companies to ever exist. My thoughts are  with all of the employees of Apple, his friends and his family. I wish the greatest success to all of you with the release of the new iPhone.&nbsp;
I would like to express my condolences for the loss of such a great leader in Steve Jobs. He was bold enough to think that he can change the world and talented enough to do so and I would like to thank him for changing my life. I cannot begin to list the countless industries he has influenced, he will truly be missed and remembered in history.  My best wishes for his family and Apple for the future.&nbsp;
I'm so sad to get this news. Steve was one of the most remarkable people in human histroy. His spirit will long live and inspire us to work harder for a better world.&nbsp;
The human being is gone... but the spirit stay with every single thing  that you created... "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."
I'm really sad about the news, after I've known his story he was an inspiration for me. He was a genius and a great human being.  My deepest condolences for his lost. 
You are always in my mind. Take care! Bye!
Words can't describe the sorrow I truly feel to lose such an amazing  human being.  In a world full of pessimists, Steve Jobs always had an  optimistic view on life that inspired me to strive for my ultimate best.  One day when were all older our younger generations will learn about the  legend that was Steve Jobs. RIP. 
Not much to say.... this is the feeling I'm having now. When I opened Apple website and saw that Steve had died, a huge empty feeling embraced me. I'm sad and I wish good things and people could live forever but like Carl Sagan once said: "nothing is forever" and when I see a brilliant mind leaving this world I'm positive that there's more beyond...  Thank you Steve.
Dear Steve, although I have never met you, I will in fact miss you.  I feel like   I have known you half my life, buying my first iPod 5gig as soon as they came out, getting the iMac back in '99 and watching   the Keynote videos annually. Your operating systems and innovative   products have marked periods of my life and have allowed my creative   side to  develop through all you made possible. Steve, thank you for   making my life more full, you were a great gift to the Earth.
Steve was an inspiration to humanity and what we can all accomplish, by believing in yourself, being socially responsible, a humanity is going to miss you. It was an honor to have seen you develop a better life for all of us.  We will miss you.
I just wanted to say that I'm forever grateful for two of the greatest  legacies and creative entities ever left behind; Pixar and Apple. It's such an awful shame Steve has died. He shaped my life in many a positive way.&nbsp;
Steve jobs was the genius of this times. He was our Da Vinci in technology. My hero and my inspiration for innovation. God have a better place for him. RIP my hero.
Thank you Steve and thank you Apple for making our lives even more pleasant and fun.  Artists, creators and inventors should be the ones taking the decision for our countries not the politicians.     There are no limits to creation, so we are looking forward to the future that Steve helped to improve.&nbsp;
Steve you gave us technology beyond imagination. You have earned your place in history now. Stay peace in heaven.&nbsp;
I already miss the&nbsp;moments with&nbsp;Steve&nbsp;Jobs&nbsp;on stage,&nbsp;and will&nbsp;never&nbsp;forget&nbsp;what&nbsp;he&nbsp;has meant to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and the world.&nbsp;No one&nbsp;else has&nbsp;dared&nbsp;to challenge&nbsp;the existing&nbsp;like him.&nbsp;A fantastic visionary man. You have now left the earth but you're impact on our daily life will be here for a long, long time.&nbsp;My&nbsp;thoughts are&nbsp;with&nbsp;his&nbsp;family, friends&nbsp;and colleagues&nbsp;in&nbsp;their&nbsp;sorrow.&nbsp;A&nbsp;great man&nbsp;has&nbsp;passed away.
Sincere condolences to Steve's family and to all who knew him. The world  has lost one of the greatest innovator and technologist of our times. We  will miss him very much!!!
My condolence to Steve Jobs family and friends. Mr. Jobs always inspired me,  and made me a better competitor everything I did. He made me believe that I  can do and create anything I think about, if I can think it I can build or accomplish it. Thank you Steve for inspiring me to accomplish many things. And again my condolences to the Jobs family.
Dear fellows at Apple,  I leave my condolences to his family and co-works at apple.  I'm very sad but pride to know his job and his amazing products and such inspired carrer.  He was built dreams and leave us built ours dreams.  Thank you and I am all tears writing these few words about a such a huge person. He inspired me and my brother a lot.  I love Apple.  R.I.P. Steve Jobs
My fiance proposed to me at the Apple store, and that only happened because of our obsession with the products and the creator of those products.  The world really did lose a spectacular human being, inventor, and inspirator.  I hope there were more out there like him, but there won't be.  He is one of a kind. &nbsp;
I did not have the opportunity to meet  Mr. Steve Jobs personally, but  my admiration for that man is so deeply.....and the legacy that you left  never die...Mr Jobs rest in peace. You always be with us when we  listenig music, working at the computer, talking on the phone...!!!! &nbsp;
I believe Steve Jobs inspired me through his innovation and passion.  His presence will be missed, but his inspiration will never die.&nbsp;
Thank you for sharing your GIFTS with the whole world. You are surely missed  by thousands. Rest in Piece friend. &lt;&gt;&lt;  P.S. Your tech helps me do my job and share
Although I wasn't fortunate enough to know Mr. Jobs personally, I am so deeply saddened at his loss. My deepest condolences for all Apple friends/family and for the Job's family.  Very very sad. Such a young brilliant person.&nbsp;
I have been inspired since the first Mac, to think different.    It was Steve's ability to make change happen, that will be his hallmark.  I never knew him, but I will definitely miss him. 
Dear employees of Apple:  You have been fortunate to be associated with one of world's greatest inventors.  Please keep the innovation going in order to honor Steve's memory. Thank you.     An Apple Fan  
Steve Jobs was and will be my source of inspiration for creating awesome solutions that make the world a better place.
From the first time I used a Mac in 1985, my world changed.  And in the 26 years since then, I've continued to see how the vision that Steve brought to Apple has made a difference not just for me, but for my children, family and friends.  He made the world a better place.  God bless his family, and all who he will continue to touch now that he is gone.
 The world has lost the man who showed us the future. RIP, Steve!&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened to learn of the loss of Steve. He personified the American Dream and was a true inspiration to all.
Steve was a brilliant man. He had the soul of an angel and was a hero to us all. Where would have we been without Mr. Jobs? Probably no where near where we are today. So I'm sending this my condolences to Apple to let you all know, we feel your pain. One of my life goals was to meet Mr. Jobs and I feel that now I've lost the chance, I will always be incomplete. Please let Mr. Jobs' family know that we love and care for them and will never forget.
    We remember that in bad times, when we were confined to the home, Steve's devices allowed us a window on the world. The whole world.                                                  Thanks to him and all the others at Apple.&nbsp;
I would like to send my sincere condolences to Steve jobs family and co-workers. He was a genius and a unbelievable visionary. I remember going to college and learning about the two founding members of Apple and what they went through as a company and a team to get where they are today. What I loved about steve was he never gave up no matter what, He kept going and created one of the most successful companies in the tech world! He inspired me to get my degree and learn about computers and I thank you sir! I am a proud user of Mac computers and I and many millions of users are grateful that Steve jobs could develop such a great computer system and phone. You will always be an icon now and forever and I hope Apple can move forward without him! Rest In Peace Steve!!! You will be greatly missed! &nbsp;
Ever since I started my first real job as a professional, I've had a picture of Steve Jobs on the wall in front of me. He inspires me to lead.  A few years ago my workplace was redesigning its website. I tried as hard as I could to make it great. The people around me didn't always agree with me, but I kept pushing. When I got tired or unsure, I'd look at my picture of Steve and think "What Would Jobs Do?"  He will continue to inspire me. All of us.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs put Zing! in our hands and our minds.  He forever changed my life.  
Sorry for the great lost of a GREAT MAN. 
In my school's halls, I talked about Apple, its products, and its CEO: Steve Jobs. Over half of the people I mentioned him to had never heard of him before, even though they owned iPhones, iTouches, iPads, iMacs, etcetera. It  saddens me to think that a man who made that large amount of a difference  in their lives would be unnoticed. I'm twelve years old, and Apple has influenced much of who I am, thanks to Steve. Now, my classmates will know all  about Steve for the wrong reasons, and focus on his passing away rather than what he accomplished during his life. My condolences to anyone who was affiliated with the late Steve Jobs. 
Steve Jobs. You are my idol. You are why I do the things that I do. You make me proud to be an Apple fanatic. You make me proud to hear that click whenever I unlock my iPod. You made me get the idea to make an iMovie about Apple. You made me want to work for Apple. Because of this, you will always be remembered. Steve Jobs. You are my hero.&nbsp;
I had my first apple in college…and I have been loyal ever since.  I reveled in his innovation and when I worked at Dell, sat helplessly in his dust.  Thank you for changing the world
 Brilliant brilliant man. May he rest in peace.            
All I can say is Thank you, Mr. Jobs.  My prayers and condolences go out to the Jobs and the rest of the Apple family.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was such an amazing man. I am an Apple customer and have   been purchasing these products throughout my life. I always watch the   launch of the new Apple products and Steve Jobs had such an amazing   air about him. He could sell sand to the desert. This man is so   inspiring and has the most amazing views in life. I've read and   watched several of his speeches and every one is different. He knew   how to reach his audience and give them specific advice for their   futures. I wish the best for his family and close friends. I can only   hope the Apple company can continue his legacy and make him a proud.   You will be missed Steve Jobs.  
Thank you Steve for the blessings you brought to the world. Not only the technology, but your wonderful personality. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
It would be neat if Siri's voice could now be Steve's. As a sort of rememberance. Since Steve is the reason all of our lives are now easier it would be nice for him to live on inside his magical devices.
I am sad to hear the notice of Mr Steve Jobs passing away.  I have been  using Apple's computer as my first computer since 1995.  Mr Jobs founded  Apple Computer Inc and this company have been giving me/us most exciting  experience in my/our life.  At this moment, the only thing I can do is  to wish Mr Jobs R.I.P.
 Extremely saddened by the passing of visionary Steve Jobs.  I feel like I've lost a family member. Thanks for giving us  a voice that can be heard around the globe and the best damn phone in the world.   Peaceful journey, my friend.&nbsp;
My thoughts and prayers go to Steve's family and friend.  The world has been robbed yet another brilliant person, yet we all know you are in a better place now. Your legacy will still keep going through the amazing company built.  Rest in paradise Steve Jobs.
Thank you for the Mac, though I never got to own one.  Thank you for the iPod, especially the three red Nanos that I own.  Thank you for the iPad, which I'm using to write this.  Thank you for Pixar, the Apple II, and too many other things.  Rest well, Steve.&nbsp;
Thanks for everything, Steve. You will be missed. Typing this with tears in my eyes. I knew this day would eventually come, but I never thought it would be this soon.  Thanks for changing the world, Steve. Computers have made our lives both easier and more complex, but thanks to you, you made it fun.  Thank you, Steve Jobs. The world won't be the same without you. 
Steve, you changed the industry. But most importantly you seemed like a  genuinely nice, good person. I hope you're at peace, and send my love to  your family and friends during this difficult time. 
 May the legacy of Mr. Jobs live forever. I'm so sad about the event. God bless his soul.. and all respects to family and friends.!!!&nbsp;
  You will be missed. May your soul rest in peace.
It was a pleasure using Apple products from day one. In the last three years I have seen the slow change of being an Apple Fan. Watching Steve on stage was a magic only he could have woven.  My life will never be the same but for Apple products and services.  We will miss. May god bless his soul and he will always be in my heart.&nbsp; 
I was shocked hearing &nbsp;this tragedy. I still can't believe.  Macintosh was my 1st choice of Personal Computer in my life. And have never thought that I want to change into another COMMON PC. Sometime it makes me fun, and sometime it makes me creative. Because of the Apple production's creativity itself.  Thanks for your great work. Thanks for your great idea. You were the very best of Macintosh. And you were the very best of Apple.   Thanks from the bottom of my heart
Some of my friends are lifetime Apple buyers. I never thought I would be. That is until the iPad. I got an iPod shortly after it came out and love it. Then I got the iPad to use as my computer and love it. I couldn't imagine any thing else and will be an Apple buyer for lifetime I am sure of that at this point. Steve was a great guy to watch and I liked his keynote presentations. Apple and the world has lost a great guy, innovator and friend. The world will never be the same and I will miss him.&nbsp;
 I'm sorry so much.            
  Steve..you have brought wonders to our lives. Thank you and we all love you. 
Dear Steve,  When my family got our first mac, the Macintosh 512K, I was 7. Since then, along with my big brother, we followed the progression of Apple to this day. Even my father and uncle eventually went into a business of reselling and providing services for macs for a good period of time. You're efforts have inspired us and influenced our lives in more ways than one. You'll be sorely missed.
I think we all feel personally touched by Steve in our lives.  What an incredible vision and power of execution.  He will be sorely missed by millions of people around the world.  He had a halo effect on all of his products -- the touch screen will never have quite the same 'touch' now.  Goodbye Steve -- if only you had stayed with us a little longer.  Not the same world without you.&nbsp;
Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and friends, as well as the larger Apple family. He had an amazing journey and will be sorely missed by all.
You will always be our inspiration and our guide towards perfection. Thanks for all the amazing things you've brought to our lives.  May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Today is a sad day. Not only for Apple, but also for all apple fans, customers, developers around the world.   Steve Jobs has become a legend of our age. He and his team in Apple has provided us several breakthrough products: Macintosh in 1984,iMac in 1999, iPod &amp;iTunes in 2001, iPhone in 2007, iPad in 2010.   What he offered the world is far beyond these great products.  His spirit will forever be remembered.   Stay hungry, stay foolish.    Thank you Steve Jobs! And best wish for wife Laurene and his family.   One more thing,... iPhone4s, is that iPhone for Steve?&nbsp;
Dear Mr.Steve Jobs, Thank you for the innovation you brought to this world. You will be forever being remembering in my heart. &nbsp; All the Best...wish the God bless with you alway. &nbsp;
A great man and a great mind. The world has forever changed because of Steve . It will not be the same without him.
I just want to thank you for everything you have done for the world. Working for Apple has been the biggest blessing in my life and I will continue to convey your vision of Apple to the world. Rest in peace.
He was truly the most inspiring CEOs of any company that the world has ever seen. Ever since the release of the apple macintosh in 1984, apple was the king of computers. It was vastly superior to all other computer and software &nbsp;ompanies both before and after it. Apple and Mr. Jobs didn't just follow other company's advancements, it led the way, it left all the other companies in the dust. It didn't have any competition, simply because apple is that good. It is simple, and mr. Jobs made the most powerful and exciting presentations of all of apple's products, helping to upkeep apple's legacy of greatness. The world has lost both a powerful, amazing businessman and a great man.&nbsp;
R.I.P steve jobs... i &lt;3 my macbook pro. you were a genius at what you  have created. may god rest your soul 
  Steve, Your creative inspiration touched not millions but the entire world.  You gave me direction and a life. (I'm guessing I'm not the only one).  The freedom of the universe is now yours.&nbsp;
A great man passed away today. I am sad, it should have been a good day  today  because I was returning from an Apple Store after I bought a Macbook  Pro and an iPad2 when the party was marred by this sad news on my first  internet connection.  Even if we can criticize the fact that some people placed him as a  living god, he was nevertheless a great visionary. He was able to make  accessible and convenient complex computer tools that others failed to  simplify or didn't want to. His ideas could be summed up in one word "user-friendly". I hope you  have lived as happy as you made us happy.  As you used to say : "One more thing. &nbsp;Thanks for everything,&nbsp;
 Simply a genius and an inspiring man... RIP Steve, the world is thinking of you and crushed by this news... The speech you gave at Stanford University changed my view on life. You changed the world. Thank you for living and for teaching people how to follow their inspiration  and passion. Forever in our heart. Goodbye Steve.
My sincere condolences to Steve's family and friends. Rest in peace knowing that your life has made a huge difference in the world  you left behind. We will miss you.&nbsp;
He was a true inspiration and a truly visionary. Hope your work remains as encouragement for other. Rest in peace Steve. 
You changed the world, it will never be the same without you. Your visions are our necessities. May your family and friends be forever proud. They are in our prayers.&nbsp;
So much sadness for a man I never even knew He was such inspiration to me as a designer&nbsp;
Steve was my idol. I absolutely love apple and all of it's products. Wha t a horrible loss. Thank you Steve for being my role model.&nbsp;
I am grateful for everything Steve added to the world. He will be missed.&nbsp;
I have 14 years and Steve was my inspiraion to decide that I want to study computer engineering. I give my condolences to all family and friends.&nbsp;
we really lost a genius, a good friend, a family!  i've been using apple products since 4 years ago, and what's most  exciting to me is Jobs introducing new product to the world every year.  I'm really sad about this.  Hope he will take a good rest in the heaven, never work this hard.&nbsp;
Steve, you bring to all humanity the forbidden fruit of paradise: the Apple.&nbsp;
My condolence goes out to Mr. Jobs family. May the lord be with with you and  yours thru this. Just remember that he is not suffering anymore. RIP Mr. Jobs. 
Steve Jobs is roughly the same age that I am.  I find his accomplishments astounding, his standards are the highest.  His creativity, leadership, and outlook for the future and making the world all it can be shall be greatly missed.  I will miss a mentor for excellence.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has been an inspiration to me. With all my heart I give you guys my deepest condolences.
Rest in peace, jobs.  We loved you, love you and will love you....
 My most sincere condolences to Steve Jobs´s family, he was and still will be an inspiration for me, thank you for making my life way to much easier and better             
Steve was an extra-man ! briefly God bless you Steve and rest in peace ! 
 wow im only 17 but yet i find out that steve jobs died and it it made my eyes very watery i really cant believe a world changing person like steve died at such a young age. you will be greatly missed and never forgotten what you started will live on forever so i guess you will really never die because your memory is what counts in the long run.
I personally want to pay my deepest resect to Mr. Jobs. I was in high school when the very first iPod arrived. I've always enjoyed music and kept in touch with the evolution of portable music devices. from CD Walkman's, to MiniDisc players, then to MP3 players. I saw the advertisement for the first iPod and I knew something was different. His brilliant ideas have paved the way for the advancement in human technology. I was influenced so much that I majored in IT: Integration and Applications at Penn State University. An amazing dream for me would be to one day assist with the creative minds at Apple. His vision changed my life. And I would like to thank him as well as his team and pay my respect.  Thank You Steve Jobs,&nbsp;
Dear Apple,   For years now Apple Inc, has been my go-to for all my  electronics, I currently own a Macbook Pro 13" laptop, an Ipod Touch 3G  32GB, and my sister has an Iphone 4 which I will get very soon, my High  School uses macs, I love the Apple company, and everything Steve Jobs  has done for the world, he is truly and American Visionary, pioneer, and  inventor. He will be missed!&nbsp;
You were truly an inspiring man. I've looked up to you for as long as I  can remember. The technological world won't be the same without you. RIP
My deepest condolences,  &nbsp; To a visionary who pioneered the embodiment of aesthetics and cutting edge technology to capture the imagination of the human mind. &nbsp; God Bless.&nbsp;
STEVE JOBS was the greatest, best and smartest man on the planet.  STAY WITH GOD MY FRIEND!!!!   
Eternal memories for a visionary and inspirational human being!
Good Bye Steve, You left us with a new way to think and communicate. You inspired millions. You fostered so many innovations across the spectrum of art and science. You insisted on quality when the rest of the world was looking for the cheep way out. You fought hard for your principles and your company. You were a great American. I sincerely hope that with the passing of Steve Jobs that his dream will endure.&nbsp;
Perhaps one of the most brilliant minds in our history in marketing and technology and identifying the utility of the public, I just want to thank Steve Jobs for providing me with resources to keep my life organized, easier, and more efficient. My prayers and condolences to the Jobs and the Apple family.&nbsp;
From Spain..... Miss you....for ever.
Mr. Jobs,  Thank you for these objects which have enriched our lives.  So much of what I do as a musician and teacher has been enriched what I do and how I do it.  A thousand years from now they will know the name of Steve Jobs as the Gutenberg of the modern age.&nbsp;
Nothing but the best thoughts go out to a man that knew how to live his  life the right way and assuredly will be remembered long after this point in time for his invention and impact on all of us.
The world orphan of one of its greatest genius, in peace and with God, Steve Jobs,&nbsp;
Hi Steve,     Thank you for the many great things you have given to us. Thank you for changing the way we live our lives. Thank you for opening our eyes to what can be achieved by sheer determination, dedication and discipline. You dedicated your whole life to create not only a cool gadget that rules the world, you created a trend, a culture and an inspiration for people who sets to be you. You might not rule the world with your riches but your legendary life will always be the immense wealth of motivation and inspiration for generations to come. We will always remember you as the world's most acute visionary, innovator and creator of the coolest and most efficient digital lifestyle in our era. Apple is Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs is always Apple. Rest In Peace. May you rest well in the arms of the Lord.&nbsp;
Thank you for all you've given myself and the world, you were a true  visionary and will truly be missed. God bless you and your family and  friends.&nbsp;
I left this line out and i feel i must include it: God Bless Steve Jobs, all  the apple employees, and Apple itself. I wish I could bring him back.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for the World wouldn't be the same without your creativity and genius, we'll miss whatever would have come! May you rest in peace and may your trails be happy&nbsp;
 Although I never met Steve his name has been known to me for a long time now . I am very sad to hear he has passed but there is no doubt that he will be remembered. As I write this e-mail I am tapping away on my iPad. I am so appreciative of his hard work and remain in awe of his accomplishments. Because of him, I am able to simply tap on a link on tumbler to send my condolences v ia e-mail. Throughout his health struggles he continued to find ways to make  life easier for everyone else. Thank you Steve Jobs, your fellow colleges and Apple. You've changed our world.&nbsp;
... offer my deepest condolences for your loss.  I'm very sad that he is gone. I hope his legacy of "staying foolish and hungry" will go on.  I don't know what else to say. I never knew him, and I'm crying...&nbsp;
 For all the joy, fun and the possibility for me to do a great job with the help of his genius, thank you, Steve.
I was luck enough to intern for Motorola during the summer between freshman year and sophomore years of college. Motorola, of course, produced the 68000 chip that was used to power first the Lisa and then the Macintosh. I used both (summer 1983 - Lisa, and summer 1984 - Mac). After using the Mac that summer, I used all my savings, and the generous employee discount from Motorola,  to purchase an original 128K Macintosh.  I later upgraded it myself to the 512 K Fat Mac, and eventually a Mac IIc af ter graduation.  I've been nothing but an Apple fan since, and most of that was due to the imagination of Steve Jobs, who saw past the technical specifications of what a  computer could do to what the user wanted to do with it. And he worked tirelessly to make that user experience as easy-to-use and as fun as possible.  Steve will be sorely missed and the world is poorer not having him around. My most heartfelt thoughts are with his family, his co-workers at Apple and his friends.  Sent from the great and powerful Amazing Wonder Machine! (My iPad) 
RIP Steve Jobs, you will always be my great inspiration.&nbsp;
The world has lost one of the brightest minds ever and we're are deeply sorry but we should be also thankful 'cause the world is better 'cause of him...  RIP Steve Jobs!!&nbsp;
If it weren't for Apple, I would never have turned out to be me. I owe it all to Steve. I already miss you.  RIP 
The many lives that Steve Jobs touched is inconceivable! His   contribution to the world was magnificent! Job well done!
Dear Steve Jobs,  Even though I didn't know you on a personal level, I felt like I did  know you. It sounds confusing, but your products always contained a  little Steve in them. I still remember the day I got my first iPod for  Christmas. That was the best Christmas ever, and every year, that  Christmas got topped by a new iPod, Mac or recently, a new iPhone. It  takes a lot of effort, time, and heart to make a little boy cry over a  wonderful piece of technology. You will always be remembered by me, and  the rest of the world. Thank you for all that you have done Steve Jobs.  You will be missed.
Jobs Family,  My family and I would like to express our deepest condolences to a great and  inspirational man. His legacy will go unmatched. His quirky anecdotes during his keynote speeches will be missed dearly by all. Even though Steve Jobs  stepped down as CEO of Apple this past August, and a new CEO was appointed,  whenever people think of Apple, they're remembering a man who had a dream and made it become a reality, a man who revolutionized the computer and mobile phone industry, and a man who found his work to be more fun than work, Steve Jobs. Our thoughts and prayers go out to you, Jobs family.&nbsp;
To The Great Apple Man,  Bravo to the Apple Man who started everything from his garage.  You are truly a genius and will be remember.  The world of IT, Computers, Geeks, Techno Freak and alikes will miss a great man.  May you rest in Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I am so sorry that the apple world lost Steve Jobs. He will be missed.  My condoleance to his family.
As I walk with a bag full of apples... Brilliant!&nbsp;
Steve was a passionate and visionary leader who embodied the spirit of greatness in technology and innovation. His brilliance and creativity reform and improve all of our daily lifestyle. He was an amazing man and his spirit will remain in Apple. My deepest condolences to his family and friends.&nbsp;
RIP.....a great loss today...I am an Apple user and have been since 1986  when I got out of college and started working for a studio...I loved  Steve like I love my Apple and it is hard to imagine a world without  either one.&nbsp;
I am very sorry this happened. Steve Jobs was an amazing person and a genius like the world has never seen. He was a nice humble man. No one could ever replace him. He is my role model. Apple will never be the same without him. R.I.P Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
He creates a world that no one has ever done.   He will be remembered for history! We love him!&nbsp;
To keep it short and sweet- working for Apple completely changed my life and  it all started with Core. I can't begin to explain how saddened I am about the loss of our innovator, our mastermind, our Keynote presenter- oh man I do n't know what I'm gonna do! Apple is so much more than a "brand"- it's a family and I'm so grateful to be a part of it.
You will always be the source of inspiration for everyone. We can all achieve great things if we set our heart and passion to it. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
 -- With great love and respect,me and my family would express  our deepest pain after having lost the greatest visionaries on the communicating technology,our condolences to those family and friends who are today going through one ot the most sad days in their lives.  STEVE,we will keep you in our memories for ever. 
Thank you Steve jobs for being The Great Innovator of my time. You have paved the way not only for me but for my kids to make communication in our daily  lives a simple step by a finger tab to the screen. My prayers are with you and your family. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
The world lost a great person. Person who contributed to making our lives more interesting. Goodbye and rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs. You single handedly transformed the design industry with Apple. I remember being in college learning graphic design, and the first Macintosh was in it's own special room, and everyone was a little awed and intimidated by it, but we all knew it was something extraordinary. I learned manually produced design as a student, and as a professional used your reliable, beautiful, innovative and intuitive computers my entire career WITH JOY!!!!!!! Not many things you can say are steadfast reliable and forward thinking, but Apple did that consistently the entire time you were at the helm. I owe a debt of gratitude to you, Steve Jobs and to Adobe. The way you approached life is an inspiration to many, and your passing is a huge loss to all of us.  My heart breaks, truly, you were like a family member, a beloved one......&nbsp;
Dear Apple, we would like to thank the brilliant Steve Jobs for leaving behind a  better, more advanced world. He was visionary who wanted to change the  way we looked at technology. Our family continuously use Apple products  such as iPhones, iPods, iPads, Macs and much more. Every time we use one  we know it is due to the brilliance of Steve Jobs and has shaped the way  we use technology and how we go through our routine every day lives. We  hope Steve Jobs, a brilliant genius, rest in peace knowing he left  behind newer, more advanced world.
My prayers and thoughts for Steve Jobs' family  Thank you Steve Jobs for all the innovations you brought to our lives.   You will never be forgotten.  May you rest in peace!   
We email from Japan. Listen to the obituary of Mr.Steve Jobs is very sad. Submitted showing a wonderful world. Thank you. We sincerely pray for his soul. 
Steve, thank you for all what you have done.  Most of all, you taught us that life is full of ups and downs and that time you spend within this world is limited and precious. I wish I can do a fraction of the impact to the world that you did, but if all of us do it, the world will be a better place. 
His vision, imagination and belief in the possibilities made my work fun.
Rest in peace steve jobs, you are a major source of happiness in the world.  
Hello, my name is Shin and I'm Korean.. Although my english is not good but I'd like to send my mind..  I really sad to hear this unbelievable news.. I love his business results.. Word is lost person who never don't lose.It's not matter Iphone4s or iPhone5 I will wait , I will miss him   And I also want Apple show more smart appearance to him Again, I'm so sorry&nbsp;
I am not an "Apple fanboy."  I am a technology fanboy.  Thank God for Steve  Jobs, and the advancements he parented through the years.  I hold my iPhone and iPad very dear, as I will the devices that follow in the future because of them.
He will be remembered for not his passion for technology but for his passion  for change. RIP Steve Jobs. What I will take from you...if you are passionate about what you do you will  never work a day in your life. Thank you for the gift you leave behind...apple. 
Steve,  I would like to thank you everything you have done.  Technology would  not have been the same without you and I would like to personally thank  you for it.  I look forward to the future where your ideas will never be  forgotten. 
I remember when I was a kid I built my own PC. I was always against apple, thinking they were overpriced and not worth it. Then in 2006, I got my first Macbook Pro as a present. Since then I've been blown away by Apple and Steve's inventions, from the iPod to the iPhone and iPad - and preparing Apple for the future before he left like iCloud. The fact is, even though I never knew Steve Jobs, I feel like he was a part of me and I feel hollow without knowing he's no longer with us. I will miss his funny and exciting keynotes, his quick-to-the point answers to customers, but most of all his mind. He was a genius in my eyes, and has revolutionised and simplified computing so much within the last 10 years, and bringing Apple up to the most valuable company in the world. What a legacy to leave behind. His family must be so proud, as am I. Rest in Peace, for eternity Steve.
Human beings like him should be immortals. Thanks Steve for all of your contribution to make this world a better one.
 I'm so sorry to hear that he has passed away.   He is my Hero forever!   R.I.P Steve Jobs     sincerely yours   \ 
I think back to my childhood, during the infancy of home computing. I was in awe of men like Steve Jobs. A true visionary that surrounded himself with  like minded innovators, and created this whole new world of creativity and  technology. A modern day Edison. He helped shape the way we work and play  together. I know, because I am sitting here typing this on my iPad.  My family and I wish the best for his family that he leaves behind.  The world has lost a great mind today.Rest in peace Steve.
Rest in peace,  Thank you for everything you did for us in ! God protect you&nbsp;
Hi everyone.  I just don't know what to talk or how to react, because it's really a  shame that Steve is gone. All that I have to say is that we have lost  one of the greatest minds of the world. I wanna thank him for everything that he have  done and how he changed our minds and our ways of living. Without him,  many wonderful things wouldn't exist.  Steve, R.I.P.&nbsp;
I'm 13 years old, and steve jobs has inspired to try my hardest to achieve success in life. R.I.P He was an amazing human being.
To the Family of Steve Jobs and all those at Apple my deepest condolences.  He made the world better for all of us.&nbsp;
You will stay forever in our memories, rest in peace.
Thank you Mr. Jobs. You were a visionary. I assume this is how my parents felt when Walt Disney passed away. 
First computers. Then music. Then phones. And then with the iPad. How many people can say that about their lives?  RIP Steve.
My heart sank and my tears fell when I read the news. Nobody lives forever but I never wanted this day to come, especially not so soon. He was one of the greatest innovators and inventors history has ever known. All his creations were the lightbulbs of our lives. People just see Apple as a company, a ticker symbol on the NASDAQ. But Apple under Steve was our guiding light; he changed the way we live, the way we work, the way we socialize.  John Nash had a recommendation letter from his professor that contained only 5 words: "This man is a genius." I can only say the same for the one and only Steve Jobs.  Rest in peace; you will be dearly remembered and sorely missed.
You were a great mind, thank you for giving me the hardware to make my future clearer.&nbsp;
 Please accept my condolences.
Steve Jobs has proven that one person CAN make a difference.  Wow.  I am deeply saddened by his passing, but eternally grateful for his presence while he was here.
All I can say is thank you, Steve.  Thank you for making doing my work on a computer fun.  And easy to do my work.  I didn't have to become a computer expert, just to write a letter.  You'll be missed.  But you are appreciated.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will be remembered by me, as a Great Innovative Man. Impressively  smart and generous. Change the face of USER INTERFACING! You will be greatly missed.  The good seem to always die young. Gone to soon. &nbsp;
For never having the privilege of getting to meet Mr. Jobs he has managed to  inspire my life through his creations and dreams. Today is a sad sad day.&nbsp;
He will be remember with great admiration and respect. He was a real   visionary who fought till the end. I never thought that his passing would affect me so much. My deepest  condolences  to his family. Someone  to have such a great role model for the new generations to   come.&nbsp;
And inspiration for many!!!!! Steve rest in peace! 
It's all about design. Forever thinking different.&nbsp;
  You were and always have been my inspiration to learn technology. I will always wish i could have had the incredible honour of meeting you in person.   You will be missed RIP Steve.  
1986. First time I used a Mac, at the University of Tennessee as a design student. Even then I realized how much it changed my approach to design and work. I didn't yet know Apple would go on to change my life.   Today I own over 20 Apple devices and have built a company around the technology.   All because one guy thought different.   I don't have the words.&nbsp;
This past February, I lost my Dad to cancer. He was 59. I know all too well how empty the world can seem when we lose one of its greats.&nbsp; Because sometimes, just sometimes, the world produces exemplary forces of light, and that is what they were.   So when their light dims, it's as if the world goes dark.&nbsp;  But it's only a flicker. Sure, they're farther away - but their warmth, &nbsp;radiance, and glow - still lights the way for the rest of us.  To my Dad and to Steve - wherever you are - I see you flickering. You are still lighting up the world.&nbsp;
I don't know too many personal stories about Steve besides what the  majority of the public already knows, but I feel that his death is the  death of so many aspirations and excitement that the general public  holds when Steve does what he does best.... reinventing the way we  think, act, and communicate. May he rest in peace and with his Lord.
What a sad loss, too young, so brilliant. We are grateful to you Steve Jobs, who MADE our Jobs, creative, inside our studios and outside in those offices.
What a visionary leader. Steve Jobs will be missed. He embodied precision in beauty and beauty in precision. He showed us that we are best when we compete with ourselves. No one can replace him. No one will replace him. No one.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to Steve and his family. I am new to the Apple family but it did not take long for me to get hooked. What Steve accomplished will be almost impossible to repeat if at all. This man was truly one of a kind and he will be missed by many. He had a vision and a dream then made them a reality.   Rest In Peace Steve.
The first time I read about Steve Jobs it was in 1986 when I swallowed an article about Apple's foundation and why he and Steve Wozniak chose that name for their company. Since then I've been inspired by the huge talent of this guy. The world won't ever have another Steve Jobs. My sincere condolences to friends, colleagues and relatives
I never knew the man but he influenced my life from the time of my youth.  I  will miss and remember him as what a truly great visionary, innovator, and creator he was.  Rest In Peace Steve!
I am so sorry that Steve left us. He is a hero. Losing him is a huge  loss for Apple, for Apple's fans, and for the whole world. I hope Apple  would always keep his spirit its foundation and let his ideas last  forever.  Always remember Steve.&nbsp;
 Desde Lima - Peru les mandamos nuestras condolencias al ver perdido a un gran visionario q persiguio y construyo su sueño para la ayuda de todos nosotros a ver a travez de apple su imaginacion nuestras mayores condolencias x la perdida del Sr. Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
The Crazy Ones Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules, and they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them. Disagree with them. Glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.  Thank you for being crazy enough to change my world, Steve.   You will be missed. I know you'll be waiting for us Mac Nuts at the Genius Bar in the sky.   Rest in Peace. 
Although I never knew Steve Jobs personally, he has been an inspirational figure in my life and I will always remain fond of his vision of the future for liberal arts and high technology. &nbsp;
The world lost a great person. But a great person gained the love of the world.&nbsp;
Once in a lifetime some one like you comes along and the world is changed forever. Thank you Steve.
The impact you had on me guided my career decisions and put a smile on  my face as a result.  The impact you had on us gurus influenced the tech sector like no one  else, and redefined cool for us geeks.  The impact you had on the world was astounding, changing the way we do  things with the most innovative tools ever made.  The impact you will have on future generations will be felt for eons.   Your visions and your genius will inspire millions in the years to come.  Our time on this Earth is finite.  But you will be with us infinitely.  R.I.P. Steve Jobs.  We all miss you immensely.&nbsp;
I love you... I'm crying... I know you're in heaven looking down at us all at this very moment... I just simply love you... I'm dying inside out as I read this saddest news of the day... Only you can see how much more enrichment you have come into my family...  Will forever love you.
He was one of the most greatest person that change the technology era for the newer generations right now.
 I'am saddened to hear that Steve Job has passed away today. He was one of the best inventors in the world. As of today I would not survive without any apple products.  RIP
To the Jobs Family, Apple Inc employees, friends: My sincere condolences at this time - my thoughts are with you. May God illuminate all your paths in the future - we're all lucky to have had the privilege of being touched by the creations of such an amazing human being. I will never ever forget him - I am 40, have been all Apple all my life, way before it was 'cool' - and will always be. Please find the inner strength to propel his legacy for decades to come.&nbsp;
Steve:  Thanks for everything you gave us over the years.  You have truly inspired me, and have allowed many of us to live out our dreams.  My Dad introduced me to apple as a child, and I never stopped admiring you and the company.  Thank you again for giving us great products that helped us make our lives more fun to live and share with others.
Just express my sadness for the death of Steve Jobs.  I am from Argentina, he was my inspiration, he was a leader, he was a genius.  I am sure that his ideas will be alive for ever.  My thoughts with Steve's family and friends.  Thanks for letting me to say good bye.
 Rest in peace Steve Jobs. He certainly was one of the most important persons in the tech world, he will be missed.             
Dear Apple,  This is my condolence to Steve's family.  He is a great and amazing human. And when he leave the earth is a big lost of the world. I am very grateful to him for his great work in creating Macintosh and so on.&nbsp;
A lot has been written already about Steve's impact on our world ... and certainly more will be written. &nbsp; But, I can think of no finer tribute than the joy that my 9 year old&nbsp;daughter gets  from every Facetime call that she makes to her friends on her ipod touch.  The giggles, the funny faces, the 'it's like you are in the room with me' feeling &nbsp;... Steve is a part of that. &nbsp; He is responsible for bringing us all closer together, for giving us computers and music players and phones  that are as enjoyable to touch as they are to use. &nbsp; Thanks Steve for pushing the envelope and expanding all of our ideas on what it possible. &nbsp; You will be missed. My thoughts and prayers go out to your family. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Today, the world lost its greatest living visionary, if not one of the greatest ever. I would put Steve on the level of Da Vinci, Tesla, and Kalashnikov. My only worry is that I don't know who could replace him.   Rest In Peace Mr. Jobs.
Steve,  Thank you for making this world a better place.   RIP. 
 dear Mr Jobs, i have always watch at your amazing work, i own many of your products. i truly love your products it is very sad that you have to leave us and your company behind. look at it on the bright side, GOD has sent you on earth with a mission. and u have succeeded, your work is done. u brought allot of difference to this modern world, we love you now and for ever Mr Jobs. apple macintosh all the way!!
Dear Apple,  please let express my condolences to the family of Steve Jobs and the whole Apple Staff.  The Apple //e was my first computer.  On the day Steve passed away I unboxed my latest Apple Computer - a MacBook Air.  When I read the sad news, I feel reminded to the day John Lennon was shot.
Our family was saddened to hear the news about Mr. Steve. Jobs.   He was indeed a visionary and, in our family, he was a leader in helping differentiate instruction for people with disabilities with the invention, creation, and advancement of Apple products.  We have a son with autism, very severe on the autism spectrum. Thanks to Nicholas having access to Mac computers, Apple software, and various iPods; He learned how to read, learned how to express himself by creating music and videos, and learned how he could help himself blend in socially with his non-disabled peers.  My heart sank when I heard the news of this brilliant man's passing. We send our condolences and prayers to those who were closest to Mr. Jobs. If he touched our lives in such profound ways, and we don't even know him personally, we can only begin to imagine how he touched your lives.&nbsp;
the world knows who he is, but I do not know him personally. what a beautiful picture you posted. he stepped down so recently and then this. He is am amazing person and spirit. what accomplishments.  thank you for posting. I am glad I have a mac.......god bless. 
See you in the icloud
I remember when my Dad bought an Apple II GS back in the 80s. It was our  first computer and from that day forward, and to this very day we are a  Mac family. Steve changed the way everyone thought about computing and  the way we interact with our world. A true genius, forward-thinker, a  believer that form AND function can work together, and an all-around  nice guy. We will miss him dearly. 
It is very hard to lost someone like mr. Jobs who was a really an  inspiration to many and who somehow had a notable influence in the world  that we live today.&nbsp;
for pursuing your dreams. The result and influences are immeasurable and your efforts inspiring. Sweet dreams and may you rest in blissful peace with God...  Peace&nbsp;
I am sorry for the passing of the greatest genius of technology! Apple II was my world growing up but then lost touch and became an MS freak still miss the way i used to hacked the Apple dos computer. he will be missed. 
Words cannot explain our grief and disbelief towards your passing, Steve. You amazed us with the brilliance of your ideas. Thank you for changing the world.
I wish to offer my sincerest condolences to Mr. Jobs' family, to Apple  Inc. and to the whole world. We just lost someone great and I for one,  will miss his innovative brilliance and his theatrical flair for  announcing releases.
Your products have changed the way we live, your vision has changed the way we dream. Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
As I enjoy the use of my MacBook Pro, iPhone and iPad, I can see the direct result of what true vision can do. As I learn Xcode, I am continually reminded of the steady progress of good programming design principles going back to NextStep. I have been, and always will be inspired by this. Thank you Steve!
There are few people who truly touch your life that you never meet. He was the superuser, a legend in his own right, and someone who helped me find my voice as a writer by the work of his own hands.  Steve Jobs was fortunate to have been born at the right time, but he will be remembered for being an uncompromising genius who shaped one of the largest, most influential, and in my opinion best companies ever.  Good Rest, Buddha's Peace, and Thank you.&nbsp;
The day has gone dark! One of the most brilliant minds of all time has left us, but his accomplishment will never be forget. He will always be in our minds, hearts and pockets. Farewell Mr. Jobs. Thank you for bring light to our lives with all your creativeness and imagination.  God bless you  We miss you!
Steve Jobs was a lot of things to a lot of people. To me, he was and still is an inspiration. He is responsible for my love of technology and my belief that it can improve the lives of every person on the planet. I feel privileged to have been around during the time of one of the greatest visionaries in h istory. Steve's drive for perfection, in my opinion, is what pushed Apple and the industry as a whole to where it is today. &nbsp;Steve inspires me to push past what I think i am capable of and reach heigh ts thought unreachable. I will always appreciate and remember Steve Jobs. I offer his family and all those who knew him my sincerest condolences, for we have truly lost a great human being. If there is a life after death, I'm sure  Steve is now pushing for it to be even better. Rest in peace, Steve. You were an insanely great person.
   Steve Jobs was an inspiration to me. My Mac means a lot more than  just a computer its a piece of Apple technology that was casted from Mr  Jobs and his team. We will never forget you Steve Jobs. Its hard to  believe that such a man of wisdom and business guru has past away. You  are the legacy of Apple and you leave it behind with truthful hands. You  are in my thoughts.  
Steve Jobs..... an inspiration to all. Knowing what he created....he made you feel like you could accomplish   anything. Let's hope that those who follow will have the foresight, the vision   and the perseverance to continue his legacy.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs. You are super incredibly awesome for creating ground breaking technology. And I thank you for what you gave the world. R.I.P my dear friend.
Thank you Steve for changing my life, rest in peace. I will remember Steve by his famous words in 2005. Stay hungry, Stay foolish.  My thoughts goes out to his family, friends and employees of Apple.  Thank you.
it take me a while... yet.. still not acceptable...  I will remember the words that you had said.  Rest In Peace.. the real innovation inspiration. 
What a visionary we have lost. One of the greatest if not the greatest. In my see, the World never is gonna have one equal or nearly like him. You'll never be forgotten, Steve. You gave us one of the biggest  passions in our life, the Apple products. You have to bee seen like an example of human,  mentor, CEO, visionary whatever, WE HAVE LOST STEVE JOBS, I think that no more  words are necessary.  Rest in peace, idol. Give us intelligence and inspiration to carry on with your genial  project, by wherever you are.  With regrets,  A Big Fan Of Yours. 
Apple products have been here with my family throughout these years and life  would've been terrible without his creations. Most of the time, his creations have made me more relaxed throughout life and they have given me much knowledge. May he rest in peace. Thanks Steve Job for making a better person out of me indirectly.
Dear Steve,  You've changed my life and those around me. you're an inspiration to all  of us. We will miss you.  my condolences go out to all who knew steve, his family, friends, and co  workers.  good bye steve.&nbsp;
I would like to send my condolences to Steve's Family. The world has lost a great man. A visionary.&nbsp;
Truly one of the greatest geniuses to come into this world my prayers go out  to the Jobs family. I love Apple so much. And I only hope that Apple will continue to grow and succeed for years to come.
Steve,  I grew up in Palo Alto and used computers and terminals like HP  Teletype's from an early age. I remember playing Castle Wolfenstein on  an Apple II at the mall. Alhough my first computer was an IBM PC Junior  that my Dad bought for me, in early 1985 for a High School report, I  used a friends Macintosh and everything changed. I remember thinking  "wow, this is really cool and so much better!". I used my friends Macs  in college when I couldn't yet get my own. In grad school at UCLA, we  built and controlled a small particle accelerator using Macs to do  everything from CAD drawings (Claris CAD), data acquisition and analysis  (LabVIEW, Mathematica), word processing (MS Word 5.1), NCSA Telnet to  get to the supercomputers and do email, and Mosaic and Netscape for  browsing the web. When I was writing my thesis I was finally able to buy  myself a PowerBook and it was magical. The one time I decided to email a  concern to you, the CEO - you, the CEO answered!  I still use an assortment of Macs and Apple products daily at home and  at work. Now that I'm married with kids, it's hard to imagine what it  was like before iPods and iTunes for the family's music, the iLife apps  to share photos and make the yearly calendar, iPod touches for my kids  on long trips, and of course the first phone I ever loved - my  iPhone(s). The company you built and the products you helped bring to  life have touched my families life and made it better for nearly three  decades. Thank you so much! I hope Apple continues to grow and thrive in  your memory, but you will be deeply missed.  Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
I am 12 and I own my own business and I want to become a computer software engineer when I grow up. Steve  was my idol and I will never forget him. Me and my family never miss a  software update, or a new product. My dream was to meet him and talk to  him. I will never forget him.&nbsp;
Thank you for bridging the distance between technology and people, for making our world simpler.   
My HERO,  You are the best in my mind.  Thank you.
I feel so blessed to work for a company with a soul that truly lives through its people - both internally and externally. Steve's death hits close to home for many of us because of this. With great sympathy for his immediate family and for our Apple family, I also feel that his passing brings us a refreshing sense of responsibility to continue his legacy. Although, that feeling comes far too soon. Tomorrow and for years to come, we will remember Steve as an amazing leader; however, I'm confident that we will continue to enrich the lives of people everywhere because of the foundation that he's laid. Thanks for that, Steve.
Hello Apple, I am so sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs, I learned about him in business management class in my school and he was truly a great leader and CEO. His ideas and leadership skills have helped me so much and I am so sad to see him go. I loved his products and probably owned around 7 of them in my life. Truly a great loss. May he R.I.P.
Your effort has made my life so much easier.  Thank You for everything and see You soon again.&nbsp;
Steve:  I never met you and it feels like I did. You made my life better!&nbsp;
Farewell Steve Jobs... Thank's for your passion and your work! God rest his soul...&nbsp;
Here I am a young technology enthusiast waking up to the sad news of Steve's passing.  The sad news has filtered through to the UK and from what I can see everybody is saddened.  Steve started back in the early 90's. I was not even in the world. And from growing up I have grown to love Apple's innovation.  Not only do I follow Apple, I follow Steve Jobs. I have researched Mr Jobs over the years and he has inspired me to achieved things in life.  This news has now pushed me to go forward in the world of technology as I continue my Computing degree.  Apple and the world has lost the greatest man i've witnessed in my years growing up.  You are an inspiration to me Steve.  Gone but not forgotten.  My thoughts are with your friends and family.  Rest in peace. 
Steve you where the greatest!!*  You touched us all. You led the way. You changed our world. You where an incredible example of has to be done: creative and a fighter in every sense.  Just like I'm feeling, with a terrible and deep loss, I'm sure that this will be felt by millions around the world.  The only positive thing about all of this is that you're leaving us your legacy.  See you in the cloud. You'll be there and every where.&nbsp;
Steve,  You were a technological genius. You created products that truly changed the world. You were a great man and will be sorely missed. Thank you so much for your contributions. Rest easy. 
Dear Steve,  Thank you for making the world a better place.
Da Vinci.  Franklin.  Edison.  Men of extraordinary vision. They all contributed greatly to the betterment of mankind, making our lives easier and richer.  They all failed more times that they succeeded but it is their successes we celebrate.  History will add Mr. Jobs to this list.  I bought my first Mac about 22 years ago.  An SE30.  A truly elegant machine and maybe my favorite.  It was ultimately followed by a second Mac and then a MacBook and then a second of those.  Three iPods, two iPhones (and looking for a third) and an iPad. All because they worked and worked well.  They made my life and the lives of my family work better and more efficiently .  Not because he made this things with his hands but because he had the extraordinary vision to have them created in the first place.  Da Vinci. Franklin. Edison.  Jobs. My deepest sympathy to Steve Jobs' family and friends in their loss.&nbsp;
I am surprised at how sad I feel. He was a national treasure, a true   genius, visionary and remarkable, creative spirit. RIP. Steve Jobs.
There will never be anyone with the brilliance, genius, and creativity that Steve exemplified.  His contribution to the world will never be matched.  God bless.&nbsp;
I am a Marine who has spent time in Afg, seen bad things happen and not shed a tear. Yet, upon hearing of Steve's death I felt like a member of my family had passed on to the other side. Steve's body may no longer be here but the world will forever bare his fingerprints like a master craftsmen who has left behind the work of his labors. Steve impacted millions and his memory will live on thru his work. I hope that he found strength in his accomplishments and HaShem saw it fit to leave him with us for a little longer because of the good deeds he did! May this time not be a time of sorrow but rather be a time of rejoicing in the memory of Steve.&nbsp;
As soon as I heard the world seem a little less exciting. We all lost a pioneer and a brilliant man who's equal has yet to be found. He changed my life and the world.
 im sorry you all lost a great inventor... but you all haven't totally lost him, because he left an amazing company behind.......invented by him a big Ipad fan and of Apple. Everyone got to go some time. Continue building the company and inventing amazing gadgets..Accept my condolences and All the BEST to APPLE            
Steve Jobs was a rare human being - a true visionary who transformed everyday life for hundreds of millions of people all around the world. What do you say when a person like that dies?  I'm at a complete loss. No doubt, we all are.  I obviously feel badly for Mr. Jobs' family, for his friends, and for those who worked with him and knew him in ways that I, as a customer of his product, never could. But at the risk of sounding just a little selfish, I feel badly for all of us. His life was far too short, and we will experience a loss as a result.  Bye, Steve. And thank you.&nbsp;
I was deeply saddened by the new of Steve's death -   He did what some only dream of - he made our lives better.  Thank You Steve for your creative spirit and leadership.&nbsp;
Obrigado pela dedicação, inspiração e pela grande contribuição que você nos deu durante sua breve estada entre nós... Thank you for your&nbsp;dedication,&nbsp;inspiration and&nbsp;the great contribution&nbsp;that you&nbsp;gave us during&nbsp;your&nbsp;brief&nbsp;stay with us...
Thank you for making the world a better place. &nbsp;
The world have lost a true visionary and leader, who revolutionized mobile technology, and the way we see it and use it.  Rest In Peace.
Thank you, Steve. I literally cannot do my job without the wonderful products developed by the company you founded and guided. But more than that, your spirit of innovation truly changed the world and is a continuing powerful, positive influence.    
My thoughts and prayers are with you in your recent loss.  Thank you Mr. Jobs for all of your inspiration as well as leadership,  and to his family for being there with him and allowing us to share a small part of your lives and inspiration. No words or thoughts can express the magnitude of the lives that you all have touched.&nbsp;
    God Bless Steve! You have been freed of your earthly burdens and have shed your mortal coil, I pray that you are now able to live out your dreams and vision in a way that this life encumberedyou from doing so! You have given us the gift of how technology can uplift humanity, I hope we are able to always use it for good.&nbsp;
I know most of us do not know how excellent it was Steve Jobs. We lost the greatest genius of the 20st century and 21st century. God blesses you Steve.
Thank you for your great ideas. For making my work and life easy, fun   and powerful. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I want to thank you for all your contributions and insights. You have inspired me, and have truly had an impact on my life. Even though I never got to meet you, I will miss you. Thank you, Steve
i love all of steve's products. &nbsp;i have like all of them!
With great sadness I learned of Steve Job’s departure.  I was a fan of his since I touched an Apple II for the first time. Getting my first Mac in 1985 changed my life and gave me a new career, a new job, and a new life. As I hold my iPad I reflect on all these past years when I thought of Apple and Steve as one, his vision and spirit embedded in each Apple product. Let’s honor his memory through creativity and innovation.&nbsp;
A fine visionary, a great businessman, and a very honorable human being that continues to bring a daily dose of kid-wonder to my life.  Thank you Mr. Jobs, and find rest and peace. 
The world is full of dreamers, there is nothing particularly special in that. But Steve was a dreamer and a doer. That is unfortunately far more rare and special.  When Steve dreamed he dreamed in Technicolor™ when everyone else dreamed in black-and-white. He had to package these brilliant dreams of his in black or white cases so that the rest of us would be able to dream about them too.   In truth, we only saw a small spectrum of Steve Jobs' brilliance. The world is much the poorer for his loss.  May he rest in peace. "Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis."
My heart is very heavy and broken upon learning that one of my heroes has go ne to his glorious place of rest in heaven! We love Mac and Apple and we are so very impressed by the spirit and knowled ge Steve brought to the world of technology. We will always treasure every memory, every piece of technology that we own and will purchase in the future to support his precious memory!!  God Bless You forever! May you rest in peace, good and faithful servant! May God Smile on You!&nbsp;
Your words have inspiered me, each time I've read any of your wisdom fraces, I've felt full of energy and ready to start a new day, looking for that, which I will love to do! THANK YOU, only a few will leave this word having inspired so many.
Dear Tim &amp; Apple Team, My heartfelt thanks to Steve for his vision to innovate products that anyone  can use &amp; enjoy. He made Apple a name that is not only associated to comput ers. My condolences to his family and the company he co-founded.
I am deeply saddened to have hear this news today. 46rom a designer  that lives by the brilliance that comes from Apple, I give my  condolences. He will never be forgotten and will truly be missed.
          Sorry. &nbsp;My prayers go out to Steve's family. I only knew him by reputation but that, in and of itself, was enough to know that he will be sorely missed. I am grateful for the gift he was in his creative genius. Peace be with all those who knew him well.&nbsp;
Steve was a amazing human being, bringing this company back when it went down. &nbsp;Completely changing of what we think of technology today. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve jobs was a great man.  He was a visionary man, unfortunately he just left us, but we will always remember Steve as a good person who improved the way we live. I am sorry for the ones who knew Steve closely, because he was a very good man. We will always remember you Steve, it was a great pleasure.
I did not know Steve Jobs, but he said something great: "Stay hungry, stay foolish".  His spirit and genius will be missed. 
Thank you for giving us so many beautiful and amazing products.  The   world will not be the same without you.  Thank you again.  Rest in peace Steve Jobs
I am a relative latecomer to owning Apple products. I inherited a G3 iBook a  few years ago and was swept off my feet. Though being older and it's fourth  owner it was simple and elegant and as Steve would put it "simply worked". Soon after that I delved deeper into Apple and to a greater extent Steve. Reading all I could, some positive and some less than so, I felt I got a little  understanding of him. I have to be honest in saying that I felt some resonance with him, almost a hero-like view. Not a perfect person but one driven to make his life and the world around him the best it could be. I don't believe anyone in honesty could say otherwise and I am greatly saddened that such  a light has past from this existence. My heart and my love go out to his family and I hope wherever he is, that he is happy... Be in peace Steve, Namaste brother.&nbsp;
Steve,  The world is a better place because of you. You will live forever in our hearts.
you'll never know how you changed my life. you've touched every person   on this earth with a smile. thank you... 
An amazing visionary and entrepreneur.  To his mourning family and friends Even when we know death is absolute, we are never ready for the journey.  He left an imprint in our world, and he will always be remembered.&nbsp;
About an hour before the news of Steve Jobs' death reached us, my eight-year-old daughter had a talk with the Big Man upstairs (that is, Santa Claus at the North Pole.) She said, "Santa, I don't want any toys for Christmas. I just want an iPod." Steve Jobs can take full credit for ensuring that millions, perhaps even billions, of people embraced technology instead of fearing it. That includes me. I got my first Mac in 1996 as a Dartmouth College freshman -- I still remember the sense of awe I experienced at the demo during freshman orientation -- and never looked back. Thank you, Steve Jobs. RIP.&nbsp;
 I just wanted to say Steve jobs was and still is my idol. He made me want to  chase MY dreams and not the world's. With out him there would be NO smart phone like it is today. I am proud to say I own both an iPhone and an iPad. My  sister owns an iPod and an iPhone. So we are apple people :). Thank you Steve jobs for all your brilliant ideas and amazing inventions. &nbsp; You will truly  be missed and we'll never forget!
You did a wonderful job making apple what it is today. May you rest in peace .
R.I.P Steve Jobs, a pioneer, innovator and visionary. A man that  revolutionized music and how we listen to music, read and interact with  computers.He is a FIGHTER of life!
I can't believe the person i have looked up for many years is now gone.  At around 7 i got my first Apple Computer. MAN was i happy. I was able  to everything. I was able to do everything from A-Z with out having to  stop and check for viruses. At around 12 years old i got my first iMac.  Man, that started getting interested in how to make iPhone apps (because  no one i know has a app on the App Store). I started to learn on youtube  how to code Objective C (a form of xml). From that i published around  5 months later, my first app.  i couldn't believe it. I was making money  off of stuff i worked hard for . I didn't even know some of the people  that bought the app! I was one of the first to find out today about steve's passing. I am  deeply sadden by it.
 I remember steve jobs as a visionary who brought America and the world into new levels of interactivity never witnessed before.  You will be missed greatly, Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
I am a dedicated Microsofty, but I am sad to hear that we as an industry and really a civilization have lost a Grande Visionary and leader. I think we as and industry need to celebrate the things that Mr. Jobs did to make the world in his own image.  He will be missed for a long time to come.  
Blessed to have lived at YOUR era, Steve. Thanks.... your work changed the world into a better place.  :) 
I just can't believe it.  Thank you, Steve. 
Your innovations, vision and brilliance helped me become a successful   commercial artist and business owner. America and the world needs more people like you. You will be missed and never forgotten. God Bless you.
Steve Jobs was a great innovator. I'm very sad that he has passed. R.I.P  Steve Jobs. You will always be remembered. 
The world lost an amazing individual. You inspired ideas, you pushed the boundaries, you created &amp; developed products that changed the way we live. You will be missed. My condolences to your family.
Dear Steve: &nbsp;I can't believe such a strong man leave us. &nbsp;He gave us fun, happy and sad for so many years. &nbsp;We get use to it, but now you are leaving us. &nbsp;I'm so sad. &nbsp;I hope you will get more happy in heaven with God. &nbsp;God bless you Steve.
Steve is a man I truly appreciate. Most of all I thank God for his life and for the opportunity to live while he was alive. Everyone was charmed by his character and impressive vision.  I honestly wish him to Rest In Peace.
It is difficult to put into words what jobs meant for all of us. It is a great loss. But he will live forever in our memories always being a source of inspiration.&nbsp;
My family's hearts go out to the family of Mr. Jobs.  The world has lost  a great man today.  Thank you for sharing him with us.
RIP Steve, you were an inspiration, the inspiration! a motivation, the stimulation, the enthusiasm, the foolish, the hunger, the passion, the lantern, you are the muse, the world was your muse  You were here for the reason the human should be on earth! to put his dent in the universe,  you did put yours, one of the biggest   You were NOT Steve Jobs, you ARE Steve Jobs! cause now you’re immortal, you ARE a page of the History’s Book   My sincere condolences apple, good luck for the huge mission Steve left behind him&nbsp;
To: The wonderful man who brought us IPADs, Iphone and MACs, &nbsp; &nbsp; May you rest in peace, i am sure you are in a better place&nbsp;where there is&nbsp;no more pain and suffering.  Take care, we will always remember you and what you have done for all of us. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
I am deeply saddened by untimely death of Mr. Steve Jobs, he was a  vision for rest of the world. He made this world a better place without  his innovations we hadnt made this far. He was a true genius, it take  years for a soul like him to visit this planet. My prayers are with  family and friends. Mr. Jobs will be dearly missed among the humanity
Safe travels, Steve.  Thanks for sharing your amazing vision with the world.&nbsp;
Steve revolutionized this world and his work and effort will never go unforgotten. My condolences to his family and friends&nbsp;

It was a great person who have changed our life - way of our thinkng,working and way of communication between each other.Its a great tragety for all mankind.
I came to the US in April, 1993 as an eight year old kid from India with a pudgy stature, olive-toned skin, a scruffy haircut and a soft, Indian accent. I had spent the majority of my life without my mother or my father and didn't know how to relate to people or make friends. I went through life feeling absolutely worthless and unworthy. No matter where I lived, I never belonged. No matter what the requirement of popular acceptance was, I never possessed it.  I survived the most difficult years of my young adulthood because of two inspirations in which I found strength and solace: music and my hero, Steve Jobs. Wherever life hereafter has taken you, Steve, may you always be the force of gratitude of millions of 'worthless,' 'misfit' kids like me that your life, genius, madness and passion inspired.  Thank you is not enough. 
虽然我没用过苹果产品，但是我可以体会到它的美与强大，对于乔布斯的离去我很震惊与哀伤，他是时代的天才，永远怀念乔布斯。
He was a great man. We need this kind of genius. Now we poorer.
Steve was inspirational and visionary. His speech about death and life at Stamford reminds me reality of life and how life should be lived. He lived life exactly like he wanted to live it like.  May his soul rest in peace!&nbsp;
I wished I could have known him. My heart goes out to his family and friends . He will be missed.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve Jobs. Your legacy'll live forever!  
My parents bought the Macintosh 512K, an Image Writer and a bunch of floppies back in college.  More than 20 years later Apple is still a big part of my daily life and career.  Thank you Steve for touching my family and my life.
 Dear Steve Jobs,  This is the first email and last email to you. You create the Apple, and you bring many many amazing things and products for us. We forever miss you. We need you.  Create Apple, Create World.  Change Apple, Change World, Change Life.  Thank you very much for your work.  Miss you.&nbsp;
A visionary founder of the greatest computer company in the world and has  been a source of encouragement and innovation for me . He made me  realize that the human mind is capable of whatever it can conceive. For  Steve Jobs, I would call him "The man that never Stopped", and only  death could have stopped you Steve, the whole world will miss you so  much.
 Thank you for your precious contribute to our generation and to the future ones.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for all the entertainment and for  help us to be more close of the world.  You were, an important part of the tecnology development.  Thanks again for your input.  Greetings to your family and closest friends, from Colombia,i will lift a pray to God for strength and comfort them.
Eternally inspiring. Thank you for opening our eyes to a new world of possibilities. We all love you. 
Steve Jobs was a amazing person that brought to the world outstanding  products. But from all he taught as that the thing we do we have to do  them in the best possible ways, and no matter what obstacles were  facing, we always have to follow our dreams. And remember, just as what  a mac represents, whatever you do make it the best way, don't be  mediocre, and give your soul to it. 
To the Jobs family and his Apple family, Although I am not a technologically savvy person, I was nonetheless impressed how his genius benefited so many.&nbsp; He truly helped change our world for the better.&nbsp; God Bless him always. To his immediate family, how lucky you all were to have him.&nbsp; Embrace the memories and tender, funny, and learning moments you had with him.
Legends never die, your spirit will always be with us, we will never  forget you. Condolences to Apple, condolences to Steve's Family. RIP 
I LOVE YOU STEVE!!! 
I am deeply sadden by the passing of Steve Jobs. &nbsp;He will truly be missed and every time I use his Apple product, I will think of him. My prayers go out to his family and friends. &nbsp;Rest in peace Steve. &nbsp;You will truly be missed and&nbsp;thanks for your vision.
To Mr. Steve Jobs (1955-2011)  It is sad that we've lost a genius, an artist, a technological visionary, a business leader, a social entrepreneur, a disciplinary integrator, a California economic savior, and a dear friend.  I've personally never met Steve, but my life has been transformed in unimaginable and positive ways through his creations as I'm sure the same goes for most people.  I've realized that his job was a tough job and being creative to please shareholders is never a walk in the park, let alone constantly being innovative in the IT realm.  I could never envision what he had done, hence the reason I stay away from the business world and reside in the academic realm, but even for those who are able, only a handful could manage the way he had managed Apple.  It's truly a sad day for many of us who have followed his life from the beginning in and out of Apple Corp.  You deserve to be appointed posthumously as a recipient of the Nobel Price in Technological Advancement Steve!  May the Angels in Heaven smile upon your ascension to their world Steve! &nbsp;
Mr. Steve Jobs........ Thank you for always thinking out of the box and including us on your  adventures. Deepest condolences to Steve's  immediate family and to all who  partnered with him to make his visions a reality... Simply saying that  he will be missed is a huge understatement... Bravo Steve for leaving a foot print on this world that will never be  filled by anyone else... You own it!  Peace... 
 Nobody else like you Steve. Ciao  
Steve Jobs was an icon, not only to me, but to the entire world. He was the most influential human being in the past millennium. His drive to succeed is unlike anyone's in the world. I haven't cried over anything since the death of my grandparents in 2004 but right now I am tearing up just writing this email. The company he and Woz founded together will continue to succeed and innovate for generations and generations to come but his legend will live on for much longer.  May his memory be eternal and may he rest in peace.
I am sorry to hear the loss of a great man. He had an amazing vision, built an amazing company. I pray for comfort for friends and family. May you go to God to find comfort. 
To all of Steve Jobs Family, just  sending our condolences and aloha from Hawaii, although we   didn't know you personally, you just made the world a little easier   with your Apple Magic! &nbsp;&nbsp;
I'd just like to give my thanks for Steve's contributions to the world, his vision was brilliant and his outlook inspiring. Many condolences to his family and all who worked closely with him, the world has lost a brilliant man - a genius gone too soon.  RIP&nbsp;
I almost cried when I saw that Steve had passed away, and I'm still in shock. I'm 24 years old, and have watched every keynote featuring Steve, and I can't imagine Apple without this creative genius. He has changed the way we communicate with each other, and the way we use a computer. He's a genius, and his family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances are more than proud of the company he has created.   Rest In Peace, Steve. Apple will continue to create products according to your vision, and your vision alone.   Sent From My iPhone, thanks to Steve Jobs.  
Today the world lost the greatest genius of this era... A person that changed how we live (music, phone, computers... Etc) even how we think and act. A person that really put in practice "think out of the box". Apple will keep striving because he left it ready for a post-Jobs era... RIP Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve, you were the Best! I wanna thank you for everything! I will Miss you!
Steve,  You are nothing but an inspiration. You may have left us, but your legacy remains.  Thank You, from the bottom of my heart.
Steve Jobs designed my first computer. I sent my first e-mail on it in the 4th grade. I wrote my first program on it. I still have my first school report that I wrote on it. I played my first video game on it (Pac Man).  Today I gave my best friend who is 600 miles away a tour of the apartment I'm going to move into using FaceTime on my iPhone.  You can argue that Apple is just a company but my life has benefited greatly from their products.  Thanks Steve for designing the tools that helped shape and share my life.&nbsp;
I was unaware of the fun in life aided by technology until I saw Steve  speak so passionately. He really made true the saying, "once you go mac,  you never go back". Thank you for giving Apple to the world. You will be  sorely missed!
 I will always remember Steve for his poetic way he talked about round  pegs in square holes as being visionaries of the future...  May all of you at apple find the courage to face tomorrow in the love  that surrounds you today.
Certainly proved the world wasn't flat again!&nbsp;
      I have been telling my family, friends and colleagues for some time that I thank God every day for the gift of Steve Jobs.  He has made my life easier, expanded my creative ability by putting powerful tools within my financial reach and immeasurably increased the fun quotient in my life as well.  I am a public high school theatre teacher, a photographer and videographer, mother of four (now grown) children and a grandmother of two.  I am truly saddened by Steve Jobs' death and no I have never written a "fan" letter before.  Now I am saying a prayer for his family and for his creative partners at Apple that his visionary genius will continue to act as a catalyst to improve the lives of all people.   Thank you for providing this platform to share my feelings.&nbsp;
May deep condolences to your dear ones, and thanks Steve for at my 70  years of age, I couldn't have learned how to use a computer were it not  due to a genius like you. 
Never has a man affected so many in such little time.  Only a genius can revolutionize the world, how people lives and make it possible that I am writing this email on a handheld touchscreen.  Your spirit lives on Mr Jobs.  RIP&nbsp;
Cancer does not discriminate...no one deserves this awful disease, which has  stolen the life of one of the world's most creative forces.  Steve Jobs was  a superhero in his industry...a man who seemed like "one of us" but was truly different, special...with special powers. He will be missed.
I'm sitting here at my Mac Pro with tears in my eyes.  I knew this was coming, but it is a shock nonetheless.    Know that our hearts are full of positive thoughts and feelings about Steve, his family, friends, and coworkers.  I don't know what else to say.    Steve, we are fortunate to have lived alongside you.&nbsp;
The world already seems less bright, remembering a brilliant man so  talented will always be the task at hand for the world. I only hope his  legacy may be carried on through his family, and the symbol that has  forever changed the world. Apple. 
I would just like to say thank you for your outstanding ideas and quality!  Hopefully Apple can keep his spirit!
How many persons you can really say that changed you life for real?  Steve Jobs for sure is one of then. Have a nice travel, buddy, and  always remember you made more in your short live that the whole world in  several decades. 
so sad - RIP Steve Jobs. Condolences to your family.
Steve's tech savviness changed my life and the world forever along with billions of others...as shown by the fact that these sentiments will be echoed across machines that he created the world over. He will be missed. Rest in peace.  -
Thanks for a thoroughly creative, innovative ride through life - you will be missed.
Since 1984 there hasn't been a man or a company (weren't they one and the same at times) who has influenced all our lives, changed the way we live and communicate, and genuinely tried to make all of our lives better. He changed computers with the Macintosh, music with the iPod, communication with the iPhone, and movies with Pixar. He may have passed, but his legacies will live on. Rest in peace Steve, the world will miss you.  
So very shocked and saddened to hear of Steve's passing. &nbsp;He will be greatly  missed by the world and technology. I'm surrounded by so many iThings. It's  just so sad. &nbsp;I'm very sorry for your loss. &nbsp;My thoughts and prayers are with  you all. &nbsp;RIP Steve. 
Steve:  Just thanks for all.  Thank for think different.
 Clever people should never die! Rest in peace Steve
Far more than the tecnology's dimension, your influence and vision reached every aspect of our lifes. You have changed the world. Changed it for better.  I'm glad that I have met you.
What a true visionary and inspirational person not only in the tech  world, but as one who really lived life fully every minute. He will be  missed by all.
Thank you for all you did Sir, your Legacy and Genius shall not soon be forgotten. I wish the family peace and condolences. RIP Mr Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a creative genius. Apple had been a part of my life for years. And will be for years to come. God bless him. He's resting in peace. Heart goes out to his family.
Here I'm sending an email from my iPad to say that Steve Jobs made part of my life through Apple's products and I'm really sad with this loss. He transformed the way that my generation communicates ... Today the king of technology leave us but his legacy will always be present.. My condolence to the family and friends...
We are saddened by this loss. A husband who changed the way in which the world communicated. A father that had a vision far exceeding the normal bounds. A friend who created a different view of our technological future. One of the most passionate  CEO's that most of us never met, and yet, still genuinely cared for.   Steve Jobs was the first to believe in the concept of ALL of us having a computer at OUR fingertips. As I write this on my personal Apple computer, I'd like to express my appreciation. Thank you to Apple for creating the most important, innovative and beautiful designs the world has ever delighted in. To the Jobs family and friends our deepest condolences and thank you for "lending" him to us. To Steve Jobs..thank you, for you have "personally" made it possible for ALL of us to escape, create, learn,  inform, connect and ORGANIZE! For you lead a technological revolution that changed us ALL!   We are saddened by this loss because he left us too soon.   We are saddened by this loss...for today we lost an iCon.  Rest In Peace. Every time I'll turn on my computer and hear that startup Apple chime...I will fondly think of you.
The Einstein of our times, the walking talking miracle guru, may his soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
I would like to say that deep inside my heart I admire Steve Jobs. God bless his soul.
Although I am only 14, Steve Jobs was and still is my idol.  His attitude and personality was﻿ truly amazing and is what keeps my dreams going.  It's sad to hear the loss, and I am truly upset but all good things come to an end.  R.I.P Steve Jobs - We will miss you. 
Repose en paix Steve. Tu es dorénavant immortel, auprès des plus grands hommes de ce monde.
 I had my first computer in 1985, I invested 5,000 dollars to buy a MacIntosh in Tokyo, Japan, my life changed after that moment. Thank You for all you brought to us Steve! May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has been my role model and idol ever since I received my first iPod. He gave me hope that I can truly be something and possibly change the world. I have never met the man, but I respect and adore him. RIP Steve Jobs, you're still my hero.&nbsp;
You were the reason I learned how to program.  I started my first job on  the NeXT hardware many years ago.  I have continued to work with  Objective-C and your awesome hardware and software.  May you continue to  inspire countless generations to come, to do whatever their heart tells  them.  You have made the world a much better place for having been part  of it.  Rest in peace. 
How does a person express their feelings about one of mankind's most  creative individuals?  May his family, friends, colleagues, and admirers  be comforted in knowing that he will be missed and not suffering.  In my  opinion Steve Jobs was even more brilliant than Einstein.  God will be  having a lot of fun in heaven now.  RIP Steve.
You have been a great manager, a visionar and an amazing innovator!! You have changed the world we live in! Thank you so much for making our lives better!&nbsp;
Without Steve Jobs we would still have flip phones as of this day. Truly a remarkable innovator. Apple will never be the same without him. I'm only 15 and the death of Steve Jobs has made a great impact to me because he is my inspiration, and my hero. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. We will all miss you! :(
I am not a super computer wiz, rather someone who loves Apple products. They are fun and exciting. His presentations, I learned from. His computer teaches me.   Steve Jobs is someone I knew.
Thank You Steve Jobs for sharing your vision, creativity and expectations of excellence with the world.  As Musician and an IT Professional, your visions and creativity have touched me in countless ways.  You will be missed!!! But you prepared us for this sad day the best you could.&nbsp;
It's one thing to know what we want better than we do. It's entirely another to build a company and a career on the conviction of that knowledge.  I've been an Apple believer since 1983,  so I guess I understand why I miss a man I've never met.  Thanks, Steve. For everything.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve Jobs...  Thank you for creating art and beauty, and inviting intuitive understanding to technology.
Did you ever miss someone you had never met? That's how I feel about Steve Jobs. My heart is heavy as I extend my deepest condolences to those who are feeling such a great loss today. People for countless generations to come will feel the impact this man made. And while 56 years is not a terribly long time to walk the earth, the world exists as a better place for having had him in it.&nbsp;
 I never knew Steve Jobs, but since 1984 I've been very conscious of   his positive effect on my ability to work, learn, and play.  It's   always been obvious to me that Jobs focused his development efforts on   designing systems to be used by people, frequently people previously   unfamiliar with these technologies.  He was truly a genius.  Every   computer I've ever owned has been an Apple and, as long as the company   retains its focus on people-friendly technologies, all my future   computers, iPads, and whatever else comes down the line, will be as   well.  I celebrate that Steve Jobs lived in my lifetime.
I'm so sad to hear this break news. Rest in peace Steve Job, you made the  history of the world technology!   You are always in my memories.
I did not know Steve personally. However, after every keynote video that was  released I can honestly say it feels like I've known him forever. I have and always will be an Apple user and dedicated fan. I kept up with every update in regards to his health I just didn't know that he'd be leaving us so soon forever. My prayers and thoughts are with the friends and family. Peace be  still.
Fairwell to Steve Jobs, my IPhone as been my favourite gadget ever and will always remind me of this genius...His family should be so proud of such a visionary who touched so many lives with the best  technology products ever. Good by to a true modern day Genius..
 Thank you for everything you have done for my generation and the generations to come.               
Thank you Steve. Thanks for your wonderful legacy. 
I did not know Steve Jobs in person.  I only knew the corporate bussiness man who he was. The man who had a vision, always to amaze and inspire others. A man who could make the world tremble in excitement.  Nothing can be said to comfort the loss of a great man as he was.   All we can do is to keep continuing his vision and passion for what he stood for.  There is only one rule, how u can vision your own world.  If you have an idea or philosophy that you believe in, keep build on it and make it your own gift to the world to share.&nbsp;
I would like to express my sincere condolences to Steve's Jobs family  and friends.Today is a very sad day.I am speechless, I just can't accept it.  I hope you are peacefully now. Don't forget that millions of people love  you and will never forget you.I am sure that, in every Apple devices, there is and there will always  be a part of your soul that will keep you with us.  Thank you Steve, thank you for everything you did.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for forever changing my life.    Rest in peace.
To the Apple &amp; Jobs Family: &nbsp; Please accept&nbsp;my condolences to the family &amp; friends&nbsp;of Steve Jobs. I have never taken the steps to write this type of note in a public forum, but Steve Jobs was a marketing icon for me.&nbsp;Steve Jobs name became synomous with something new, innovative, and "fresh.". Even I could not resist&nbsp;the opportunity to purchase my first IPod and now IPhone. In college, my professor used to say "Marketing is Everything and Everything is Marketing" .. and then there was Steve Jobs. &nbsp; &nbsp;
Thanks for making a better world, for being an inspiration. You are a hero for me and my family. RIP dear Steve. God will have an awesome guest at home.           
Thank you Steve Jobs for the vision. I wouldn't be able to do what I   do today without a Mac. It's not just a computer, it has become a part   of me. My Mac has changed my life. Steve Jobs has changed my life.
We'll miss Jobs, he was a model of inspiration, hope and hardwork for all my generation. It is really sad to lose this kind of people. Steve, wherever you are, our prayers will follow you. God bless you.
I really regret the lost of Steve. He was for all of us an example of a huge  creative men. I assure my prayers for him. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for everything!  Having worked for Apple since day one of the Apple Retail launch I feel extremely honored to have been part of an amazing story only made possible by a visionary such as yourself.  Thank you for an amazing journey! Rest in Peace. You will be missed so very much.&nbsp;
I bought my first Apple product in 2007, the first generation iPhone. I was not an Apple fan till then, though I was aware of Mr. Jobs and how he had rescued Apple from hard times in the 1990s. I can remember watching the 2007 keynote in which the first iPhone was introduced, and he spoke with such gravitas that since then I have associated only one man with one company: Steve Jobs and Apple. No other successful company had such a living icon at the helm...I missed his presence at the keynote this year, his sage, confident words strangely absent. Apple is Steve Jobs, inside and out, and as Walter Cronkite once said "There won't be another Walt Disney..." ...there won't be another Steve Jobs.  Rest in Peace, God Bless you and your family.
Steve Jobs, thank you so much for bringing us so many miracles. I believe, Apple, where amazing happens.  Miss you, Forever. 
In the early 1980s my father dropped me off at school for volleyball practice.  Unbknownost to us, school was cancelled that day.  While I waited for my mother to pick me up from school, I played on our APPLE computers.  This was VERY INNOVATIVE for the early 80's.  I clearly remember my 1st experience with a computer.
May Steve rest in peace!!     As an Apple owner myself, I am deeply saddened by this     My thoughts are with his family.
Soo long Steve! You've done so much to the world!  Sent from my iPhone 
 To whoever is reading this, You, no doubt, have been affected by Steve Jobs' early, tragic death. To be honest, who wasn't. I was shocked when one of my heroes' name was plastered all over the internet, along with the words R.I.P and dead. He really never will be replaced, by anyone. Innovation, was just one of his perks and separated him from the rest. If he hadn't created Apple, then we would not be in wonder at all of the seamless, exquisite phones, laptops and music players, glistening in the shop window. He created new technologies, with names that deserve to be in the dictionary. He created an era, a generation of Apple lovers.  iWill never forget him. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
He was an awesome man, we all are going to miss him soooo much! He was  my inspiration, my model to follow! An iconic man... The world is not going to be the same without him, this is the world's  worst loss!  RIP Mr. Steve Jobs, you will always be a part of our life, I will always  remember you!
Thanks for all Steve.  Your life inspiring me a lot.&nbsp;
 I just can't believe that we don't see Steve Jobs anymore. I am really sorry for what happened today.  Dear Steve Rest in Peace forever.&nbsp;
                  The world needs heroes and visionaries now more than ever and Steve Jobs has been a giant that has allowed us to all see much further. His inspirational products have shaped lives and build a creative industry that will be feeling the loss of an icon.  Mac, Ipad and Iphones across the planet are his legacy and stand as epitaphs of how one man can change the world.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your visions and your ability to see technology into  the future. You have revolutionized an era and it will only see even  further advancements. I will continue to support Apple in honor of what  you have done. Thank you Steve Jobs! You will never be forgotten.
Hi Steve,  You are the greatest man in history, no one could ever replace you or Apple. It's a pity that you have passed on early, but your rewards shall be up in Heaven. From Apple Computer to MacBook to iPhone to iPad. You have worked very hard, take a rest and watch over the young ones who are replacing you. RIP Steve Jobs!&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs-  Thank you for your wonderful genius and inspiring creativity.   America has lost one its truly great leaders of art and industry.  Rest  in peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a Titan of Industry, walking down the same halls as Carnegie and Rockefeller. 
 Your life was short but you brought us joy with all your innovative and ground breaking ideas,  we will forever remember you. May you RIP and God bless you Steve.
You were the best. My daily life would not be the same with out your   contributions to this word. We will miss you. 
Thank you Steve Jobs for everything you have done with technology, without you we would still be using walkmans!
I have been an Apple fanboy for 34 years, starting with serial number 7000 Apple II.  My two daughters grew up learning to use and program on an Apple II.  Many times I thought to send SJ a note thanking him (and the WOZ) for all the enjoyment they have given me over the years and I regret not doing so.  God bless and thanks Steve Jobs.  He did it his way and we are better for it. 
I don't know who this goes to, and I'm sure that you'll be getting much more prominent and prestigious people remembering Steve, but I feel remiss in not reaching out. I have no great story. I have no personal connection. I've never exchange a look, glance or word. Yet the passing of this complete stranger makes my heart sink. I've watched Apple for a good portion of my life. I've benefited as a child playing Lode Runner, the beachfront runner and making small programs that responded to questions. My later life has turned to graphic design and advertising, Mac being all industry standard. Looking at businesses and advertising, Apple has come up many times. My life is enriched, enhanced and completely changed due to Steve. It's something that would excite me. I would find my self anticipating the things Apple would do. Steve really has been a raised standard in the technology world, and everyone is constantly having to raise up to that as he moves forward. It has effected the way things are innovated and proceed. I think Steve is one man that has made this a better world for us and those to come.&nbsp;
As a tech geek, Mr Jobs had a profound affect on my life. From my family's  first computer, Apple IIc, to my first laptop, a MacBook. To my first MP3 player, iPod 20GB, and first smart phone, iPhone 3G. And first tablet the iPad. But I have to say the most amazing has been when I gave my sister my iPad when I replaced it with an 11" MacBook Air. It ended up being used mostly by my then 2 year old nephew. He's 3 and is a pro at using it. He loves to  go to YouTube and the ABC app to watch car commercials and cartoons. When I saw how quick the little guy learned, on his own, to use iPad I finally understood the genius behind the iPad.  Steve Jobs and his genius will be missed by the world.  Thank you for some amazing decades.
An icon to be remembered as one of the greatest ever lived. Will always be with me. Heartfelt condolences to his wife and family.&nbsp;
I can't express my sorrow, I knew that this will happen soon, since my Dad died from the same illness.  I didn't know him, but I have had followed him since 20 years or more, this person was an amazing genius, I don't think I will see anybody like him during my lifetime, people like him, only born every 1000 or 2000 years. Please accept my condolences, I am very sad to know this, this planet will not be the same without him.  Hurray  for Steve Jobs,  I can tell, that even if I haven't known him, I had the pleasure to see what he has done in real time.  Steve, you will always be remembered as a true genius, as a true human being!!! Now, you have to revolutionize heaven, I am sure of that.&nbsp;   
My thoughts and prayers are with his family - both natural and at Apple. He made an impact on the entire world.&nbsp;
It is hard to imagine a world without Steve Jobs. May he rest in Peace. I can already imagine him  in Heaven presenting a Keynote to angels. 
My brother, Buzz, once made a point about how visionaries impact the world by using Tesla as an example. Nikolas Tesla was a pioneer in the field of electricity. &nbsp;Tesla's life's work is now Electricity 101 for todays beginner electrician. We, as a society, stand on the shoulders of brilliant people who have come before us. And these rare visionaries lift us so we can reach higher than we ever could have on our own.  My life, my work, my photography has all been made much easier because of Steve Jobs' vision. &nbsp;More importantly, the things he dreamt-up allow me to stay connected in a very real way to people I love who are far away. I am profoundly grateful for the impact he has made on my life.  On a more personal level, I am a child who lost an amazing parent to cancer. &nbsp;My heart aches for his wife and his children. I will keep them in my prayers. &nbsp;
He was obviously a genius.  It is so sad to think he is gone at such a young age. 
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. I still want to work for you and live your legacy. Thank you for making our world what it is today with your technology!   APPLE! 
 I have never known much about Mr. Jobs but his influence is  everywhere I look. I have an iPhone I use obsessively and a new MacBook  Pro that I love very much. He has done so much for the world. Even the  people who never knew him will miss him. My deep condolences to his  family and friends. The world has lost a very great man, but his memory  will live on as the genius behind Apple.
I am so sorry to hear of this as I was shocked to even hear and even more saddened to think of losing such a visionary.  He will be missed, but I hope to keep seeing improvements to his company throughout the years. 
Thank you steve for changing the world for the best. I can't imagine where we would be if it wasn't for your great ideas. You will always be a model of success for me, and an inspiration.  You indeed changed the world.    I want to finish by saying one message: "Three apples changed the world, Eva's, Isaac Newton's, and Steve Jobs'"   peace be to your soul.
Steve created a bright light of excellence in a world of mediocrity.  He allowed my creativity to erupt forth, unfettered.  He is proof that great people seek excellence for its sake alone.  He changed the world.  From my earliest years I recognized Apple's brilliance.  Well done, Steve. You were a friend to us all. &nbsp;
You will be missed. People like you come along once every 50 years.  Taken so young from us. Rest in peace Steve. 
I am very sad to hear about the death of Steve Jobs. His innovations are a part of my daily life. He is a hero of the technological world!  Thank you Mr. Jobs for all contributions, you will be dearly missed.&nbsp;
I sit here writing this email on the device that was born of your creation, iPhone 4. Not only have you changed the world but the company you built into an empire has treated it's clients well and the values that you instilled into the people who run it will live on.    I hope that anytime a change or a new product is spawned the company asked  themselves...  (How would Steve Jobs have done it?)&nbsp;
RIP brother. You changed the world in technology for the better and your legacy is the basis for all future innovations. I'm so happy I was alive when you graced the world with your leadership and vision for an amazing company. The world will never be the same because of you and without you.
 We thank him for all he has accomplished, may he rest in peace. 
Thank you steve! I hope My children would be as innovative and creative!
Besides my pa-pal, Steve has been the most inspiring man in my life.
Your vision allowed my mother to use a computer.                     Thank you. 
We have just heard the news that Steve had passed away.  Our thought goes to his family and all people at Apple.  Have been using Mac more than a decade since Performa days. Can't imagine Apple without Steve Jobs.  We'll truly miss the father of all innovations.  Steve, you can rest now. You've done most amasing work that nobody in this world couldn't have achieved.
Rest in peace Steve and to Apple: He has lit a spark- keep the light   glowing for future generations!
A legend is gone. He will always be an inspiration to me and to the world. Goodnight, Steve.
 The only thought that comes to my mind is ... Thanks for this new revolution!!! RIP Steve.&nbsp;
Steve, you inspired me by your intuitiveness, and creative vision.  Let  the world never forget you. 
 I will miss you so much Steve.
Millions of people "think different" thanks to Steve Jobs, no more words  in this moment.  I love Apple.&nbsp;
Just wanted to give my condolences to the family, and close friends of Steve. He was a genius and has left the world in shock with the news of the tragedy. May he rest in peace and may his legacy continue. Sending this email from one of Jobs creations, my IPad 2.&nbsp;
Best Man Ever.  Rest in Peace Steve.&nbsp;
Just as my daughter was starting to comprehend the impact his vision had on all of our lives and now he is gone.    His spirit and contribution has become such a part of our family.   I feel like I have lost a friend even though we never got the chance to meet.  Let's hope that Apple lives on and continues to be a company and group of people that would make him proud.  Love and prayers to the Jobs family and to the Apple family.     We must all step up now and live up to the promise he created.
Apple friends and family, you have my deepest sympathy over the loss of Steve.  He was an extraordinary individual, only to be seen once in a lifetime.&nbsp;
He was awesome and inspiring in so many ways. It was assuring to know that a testimony of believing in oneself existed in this world. He will be missed.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs made design a priority, not an after-thought.  He pursued his passions, not the bottom-line.  He made a tangible product enjoyed world-wide, not an esoteric financial instrument of dubious value.  As for the man behind the genius, I recommend the commencement speech he delivered at Stanford University in 2005. 
 All we have learned about in my final year of studies is Steve Jobs, and all the wonderful things he has done for the world. I am so saddened by this but I will always remember Steve Jobs. He was as influential and important as Edison, Ford, or Einstein.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for your brilliance, your creativity, and never  ending ideas.  We Apple users salute you and thank you for the tools you  have given us. 
In my country there is proverb in companies that says that no one is unreplaceble. But now I know that is a big lie. Today the world lost an unreplaceble man. I became an Apple fan since I bought my first Apple product last year and more after buy my iPhone 4, so I could appreciate and admire a little bit the products developed by this incredible mind. I hope that my condolences could reach the heart of Steve's family and God may confort all of them. Steve, R.I.P.
Keep sending your team more creative ideas from right above and watch over them! We love and Apple! May you rest in peace. You will be missed!
We know he's always there looking at the apple world he's created for us. RIP Steve.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs inspired myself to believe in something more, to know that my  dreams are attainable. I, along with the rest of the world, will miss  him, not only his products but the light he brought to so many people's  worlds.  I hope the team at Apple will do something amazing to  commemorate not only his life but his work. 
One of the greatest men who the world will always remember.        
I was shocked to learn of Mr. Jobs' passing, and I was deeply saddened. He was the visionary of my generation, the founder of the 21st century. Though I did not know him personally, I was familiar with his legacy. I am proud owner of several Apple products, and I am a Mac forever. I wish to pass on my condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and friends. I trust that Apple will continue to produce the exceptional products it always has. &nbsp;&nbsp;
My deepest condolences go out to Steve Job's family and colleges at Apple. Steve was, and will continue to be, an inspiration to millions around the world, including myself.
The world is a better place because of Steve. We will all miss him. Tell his friends and family that we grieve with them.
I cannot think of anyone who I've never even met who's had anywhere near the positive influence on how I've lived my life for the past 20 years.  What a massive loss for everyone who has ever experienced the sheer thrill of Apple's insanely great products.  Rest in peace, Steve.&nbsp;
I know that Steve Jobs was a controversial figure but he did a great job of steering the big Apple mothership by sticking to his vision! I love all the products that have come out of Apple. They are the most stable, user friendly, and beautifully designed devices in the digital world. I think we should celebrate his short and spectacular life on earth. I hope that Apple continues on in a fashion that would make Steve proud.&nbsp;
Apple,  Steve was, is, and will always be my hero. His inspiration, confidence, and  intelligence has helped to guide me through my path in life, and he will always have a place in my heart. My deepest condolences go to his family  and very close friends as I know they are going through a very sad moment in time. I will never forget the speech that he gave at Stanford University  about his life and connecting the dots, as I am still trying to connect mine. Steve will be missed, but his spirit will live on forever! Steve I miss you man, Rest in Peace old friend.  
The only thing I can do right now is just thank you for you existed in this world, Jobs. I never met you, but your&nbsp;life was inspiring to me.&nbsp;  Thank you very much.  &nbsp;I will pray for you.  Go in peace.
My heart sank.   Passion - second to none!&nbsp;
This evening I put fairy lights all around my new iMac and lit candles and only then, after reading the news about Steve, I realised I had created a shrine!  Hoping Apple will keep his spirit alive. Please accept my condolences.
I have loved Apple computers from the moment I decided I needed a  computer. I don't remember my 1st Mac's name but I remember how  awesome it worked!  I know my second one was a Ruby iMac that I adored.  I have since had 2 other Macs, (there will never be another computer for  me), iPod nano (which has lasted me forever!!!) and an iPhone 4. I have never met Steve Jobs but I watched all his Keynotes on new  products and was mesmerized and thrilled by his engaging manner, and his  never ending enthusiasm. &nbsp;I have never met him but I will miss him.
People often ask, 'If you could meet anyone at all, who would it be?' - My answer has always been Steve Jobs. His enthusiasm, vision and genius is inspiring and I'm so sad that he won't be taking to the stage anymore.&nbsp;
As an iPad 1 user, I'd like to show my full respect and condolence to Mr. Jobs and his family. He changed the way of living for so many people including  me. God bless him peace in heaven. God bless his family and Apple!
To whom it may concern, &nbsp;&nbsp;<div>Today we truly lost a great innovator and person. I don't have a iPhone, iPad, or iPod but I know of the brilliance it took for Mr. Jobs to create such world changing products. He is the quintessential American dream, from nothing to more than something truly amazing. We should be so lucky to have just known him and to learn from him. Learn that failure will not keep you down, hard work will take you places, and being something is beyond being rich. &nbsp;can confidently say if we all live like Mr. Jobs, the world would be a better place. Thank you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
My thoughts and prayers are with his family.  They should find  condolence in knowing how many people are in awe of his genius and  aspire to be 1/10 of what he became.
My daughter's first home movies were recorded on our iMac. My wife and I shared those movies with friends and family through our iPod. Our daughter quickly learned to surf the web and play online PBS games on our MacBook Pro at the age of 3. We used your creations to keep our cherishing moments alive forever. Thank you. You will be missed by everyone, especially us.&nbsp;
We lost a hero, a genius to the whole world. Best of wishes to the family and the best luck to Apple.
Rest in peace Steve Jobs &lt;3 
OMG, this day comes TOO SOON! I don't want to believe it is true. This is such a loss to the whole world...my 4 year old son LOVES iPad because Steve made such great product so simple. I am crying because we lost such a genius. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Steve,  You changed the world, how people live, connect, share and enjoy. Miss you and thank you.&nbsp;
    The world thanks you Steve.  You touched every corner of the globe, and your legacy will never be forgotten.  As you once said “Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me, Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful, that’s what matters”.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve and Apple for being a part of my family, not just because of the tools and devices that you sold... but your imagination and creativity. My most heart felt condolences to Steve, Apple and our families.
It's so sad to lose Steve Jobs, he was a genius and a visionary man, God Bless you Steve Jobs.
I have been a fan and user of Apple products since 1991.  Back then it  was hard being an Apple user, but you also felt you were part of a  special group who knew about a very special secret. Apple.  Like many early Apple users I have "converted" many friends over the  years to the Apple platform.  And as soon as they touched an Apple  product, they were a fan.  It feels great to know I saw something early  in Apple that the world now sees and appreciates. Everything special  about Apple started with one man.  He was the Heart, the Brain and the  Courage of the company. He was Steve Jobs.  Thank you Steve for the personal inspiration, and the inspiration you  gave to the world.  I will always try to "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish!"   and continue to try and push people to "Think Different!"  You have inspired us all!
To some, he's the boss. To some, he's a friend. To some, he's a family man. To the world, he brought ideas. He brought change. He brought people together. As you leave us, we won't forget. We remember.   A leader. A visionary. An innovator...  Steve.
Words escape me right now.   He will be missed. 
 I remember using a computer for one of the first times of my life in elementary school, it was a Macintosh and I recall being full of awe and excitement. That idea, that technology is a special and magical thing, that has stayed with me since then and to this day I still feel a sense of excitement every time my Mac boots up. Steve, thanks for changing our world.&nbsp;
 From now on, each time I pick up my iPhone to make a call, surf the internet, play a song...I will remember a great human being who created the device.
My wife and me are really sad with the notice.  I'm from Brazil, and I like products of Apple.  Rest in peace Steve, you was a great man. 
I did not know the man personally but from what I have seen in keynotes and foundations he was truly a great man!!!!   Godbless you and your family Mr. Jobs!  I hope that the world finds another like you!
I never met him, yet I feel such a sense of loss.  He made my world a better  place.  He inspired me to be a more creative person and to see the beauty in all that is around me. Thank you Steve Jobs.
A man who certainly changed the world. He will be missed. My sympathy goes out to his family, friends and everyones life he has  touched. Rest In Peace.
I send my condolences to Steve's family. I also lost my mom 2 month ago  for a pancreatic cancer and I understand what they feeling. It is not  for sure a good moment. For me, Steve was an inspiration. I admire him.  All his family should be proud of having shared their lives with him. There goes a great man. The world will miss him. I will miss Steve too. Thank you very much Mr. Jobs.
We will forever be grateful for his revolutionary vision. Our prayers go out to his family, friends and collegues.
As a Mac user for 25 years and Apple stockholder, the guy my online Mac user group calls "The Steve" was instrumental in my life and in that of many others.  May he rest in peace.  My thoughts are with his family as they go through this difficult time.&nbsp;
A very sad day for the Apple family &amp; their supporters! A great man he was. Shall be missed dearly! Condolences to his family &amp; employees. 
Steve Jobs had inspired me to study computer engineering in college and to think about the ways in which technology is ever-adapting to work for people rather than serve as an obstacle to innovation. His philosophy is definitely deeply embedded in Apple as a company, and I have no doubt that some of your best products have yet to be conceptualized, crafted, and enjoyed by people worldwide. I'll continue to be an Apple fanboy at heart, and I can't wait to see what the future holds. May Steve rest in peace. He served a fuller life life than most of us will know.&nbsp;
Oh my God it is a big loss for the entire human community. What a man he was such a visionary changes billions of people's life across the continents.  My hearty condolence for his family and friends.  God may bless his soul to rest.
Steve Jobs put the vision in visionary. He designed the future, and then he made it happen.  My condolences to Mr Jobs' family, friends and colleagues.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve, You did a really really great job and you help a lot of people in the world. Cheers.
Mr. Jobs changed the way I lived my life, the way I interact with my loved ones and how one's ideas can impact millions of people. He was my snow flake that set off an avalanche in my life. I now own an iMac, an iPod, and an iPhone.  Thank you Mr. Jobs. Your brilliance will be missed.&nbsp;
To all entrepreneurs and comeback kids, first-timers or veterans, your genius was truly awesome and an inspiration. It prods us to pick ourselves up from setbacks and shoot for the next big thing.
Thank you for your innovation, inspiration and vision of a better quality of life. May your vision live on in those you entrusted and the generations that follow.  RIP Steve Jobs.
For the all the iProducts and that inspirational speech at Stanford graduation. You will be missed. 
 I'm really sorry about the death of a great visionary, yet a great human being. We will remember Steve Jobs forever!
Thank you Steve! You are always on my mind. 
 I am convinced that heaven is smiling upon your family. You have been a gift to mankind and we will forever be indebted to you for the sacrifices you and your family made. Mr. Jobs my family and I pray that your family finds solace in knowing that you have been and are a Technology Pioneer. And you are an inspiration and your legacy will last for eternity. Thank you. Thank you for all you have done. May you rest in peace, May heaven smile on you.
You thought different. Made me do the same.  RIP.&nbsp;
All of our thoughts and condolences go out to the Apple team and Steve's  family. Steve will be missed very much by all of us and I'm sure especially to  the Apple team and his family. I love Apple and what Steve has done with the company. Thank you for all you have done Steve! You will truly be missed.
Thank you so much for your creativity and sharing it to the world. You were a such amazing person and you will be remembered always.
Steve jobs has a worldwide appreciated taste, a true maestro of  combining liberal art and advanced technology. May his soul rest in peace! 
IDio, Steve.&nbsp; Grazie di tutto l'io.&nbsp;
Wow.  What a heartbreaker....  I am sure he will be sorely missed.  The world needs more people like Steve.  My condolences to his family and the entire  Apple organization.  He made me very proud as a shareholder and Apple fanatic!&nbsp;
October 5th, 2011 will be remembered as the saddest day in the history of digital world. Mr. Jobs, you are defintely one of the greatest pioneers and visionaries the world has ever come across. Thank you for thinking differently and hats off to your creative genius. I wish I had met you at least once. May your soul Rest in peace, my iDol.&nbsp;
God bless Steve Jobs wherever he is. Thank you for all the inspiration!  I will never forget.
To the family and friends of Steve Jobs:  All our condolences to you during this difficult time. We mourn with you, but at the same time celebrate a life well lived and an enormous contribution to society. Mr. Jobs is an icon and even in passing he will forever remain with us. May the lord rest his soul in everlasting peace.&nbsp;
 I'm 14 years old and I'm going to grow up to be a computer programmer (hopefully for Apple) because of Steve Jobs. 
I fell in love with Apple because of Steve Jobs.  God bless you, your family  &amp; Apple.&nbsp;
The other day my dad showed me Steve Job's speech at Stanford. In his speech he stated that people should live each day like they will the next, so I tried it out and it seemed to work so last week everything went tremendously well, and come next week I'm doing the same thing but then I hear that he passed away, and now I am not only shocked but upset also.  I am writing this with an iMac. 
I can't even believe he's gone. Cancer has taken away yet another great life. Even though he is gone, we still have our iPods, iPads and iPhones to remember him by. I was so devastated when I found out, but he lived a good life. His inventions are amazing, and someday kids will be reading about him in their textbooks. I would like to send my condolences to his family and all of those who knew him, which I unfortunately hadn't. However, I love Apple and this was a big loss. May he rest in peace.
Despite his detractors, Steve Jobs has died a legend. The world has lost a visionary who changed the way people work, play and think. I will be eternally grateful for his enabling of PIXAR - the results have brought me so much pleasure.  Thank you and RIP Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
Many people walk through life without an objective, a reason to fight. Those  people wander through life and do nothing to help others, to make the world  a better place. And these people could disappear and nobody would notice. Sadly, those who go beyond these categories, those who change the world, and those who live life to the fullest, are few. Steve Jobs, you have changed the  world in ways that no other will achieve. Rest in peace.
Apple and humanity has lost a genius.  Bye Jobs.&nbsp;
Thank you Mr. Jobs for all you have done.  You truly have changed the way  we connect with the world and the ones we love.  Your legacy will  forever be remembered. My condolences to the family. 
To all at Apple and who use their products, The world truly has lost a great person who will be sorely missed for  his foresight and creativity.&nbsp;
I cannot express my deep sadness at the news of Steve Jobs death. In all things he has inspired myself and my company and has been a constant example to me of how to do things right.  His passion was contagious. His vision was iconic. His legacy is inspirational.
Thank you Steve, you've changed my life.   
I came home from work and opened my laptop to see this sad news. Apple and Steve's company brought and keeps bringing forward the frontiers of technology that has built a bigger following then some religions and the feeling we the Mac lovers of this world feel towards the company and Steve is religious.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
I want to express how sorry I am to his wife and children. Steve Jobs definitely had the kind of impact on technology that few will ever have the chance to have. Such a loss for us all.
The world is less beautiful this evening.
Steve Jobs rest in peace!  You were and still are one of my heros!  You gave us tools with which we could extend creative work in the NEW ERA.  If I shed a few tears today it is because there are not many who blaze trails as you did. Thanks so much Steve!!!  
My condolences to Steve Jobs' family and friends.  The world lost a great man. A true visionary that revolutionized the way  we live. Steve has made a profound impact on society in many ways from the way we work to how we communicate. The graphic design community is forever in  debt to Steve for giving us the Mac. We can't think of Steve as no longer  being with us. By keeping Steve in our memories and remembering him throughout our lifetimes, we keep his spirit alive. He will, without a doubt, be  remembered for all eternity
 Thank you for being an inspirational leader and for working tirelessly to build a company that has had such a big impact on my life and the world.  You have taught me many things although I have never met you.  Your company and its products have changed the way I live, work and play.  I've been inspired by the simplicity of Apple products and how we can interact with them in a way that is human.  Aside from all the corporate/business stuff - I hope you had time for yourself: time to enjoy life, time with your family, and time to  step back and get a grasp on just how much you have done for the world.   Thank you Steve, may you rest in peace - you will not be forgotten and your spirit lives on in the millions of apple devices and minds of people who know  and love what you have done for us.&nbsp;
 the legacy of steve jobs lives on in the hearts and minds of all the  lives  he touched by his vision of creative possibilities. through  him and because of him, we walked through the corridor of thinking  outside the  box.  he read between the lines and went beneath the surface..to give each and  all of us the childlike freedom of exploring and expressing.  heartfelt gratitude for him leaving this a better world than how he  found it.  perhaps the biggest contribution. &nbsp; &nbsp;
Good-bye Steve! We'll miss you! My condolences to his family. 
May he rest in peace. I will miss him. The world will miss him.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs the man who lived to share his creative imagination of technology to all people that wanted to think different. &nbsp;R.I.P Steve Jobs the one that always thunked different.
Steve Jobs... You left your mark on our desks, on our ears, on our  hands, and above all in our hearts. Thank You. 
Worked a night job back in 1987 as a college freshman so I could save to buy my first Mac. "Girls" using computers was not very popular back then. My first Mac was awesome and what I could do with it led to many of job opportunities at UCD. I never stopped learning. My first Mac gave me access to whole new world and eventually to a Masters in Educational Technology. Steve, YOU REALLY CHANGED MY WORLD! THANK YOU!
Dear Steve Jobs, You've done so much for us Steve. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
My thoughts are with Steve's family, friends and coworkers. If a simple fan of his work like me that has never even met him feels so sad, I cannot imagine the sense of loss felt by those who were around him day by day. To Steve... Thank you for making the world a better place, for your inspiration, thought leadership and passion.
I'm writing to express my condolences and sorrow; because Apple hasn't only lost a great designer, but also the world has lost a great human being. I only want to say one last time: Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
Despite the sadness that is inherent in times such as these...  Talk about  a life worth celebrating.  America finds itself in a state of woe and entitlement when it needs to remember its roots; built on innovation.  I personally want to recognize Steve  Jobs as a visionary, someone I learned from, and a philosopher that inspired me in my career and personal life numerous times.  Be constantly curious  and "more important than what you decide to do, is what you decide not to do"...
He was truly a great man. He changed a lot of things on how people live their lives today. It’s just really sad because the year I finally got to the Apple HQ at Cupertino, is the same year this visionary passed away. We have lost a legend, but his memory will forever live on in everybody who appreciates the numerous advancements he has given us. Rest in Peace Mr. Steve Jobs…
Thanks for bringing us the future in our own time. You will be missed. 
What can I say other than THANK YOU for everything.&nbsp;
Thank you for everything. You inspired me. 
Dear Apple,  Steve Jobs and Apple Computers have been a part of my life for over 20 years. I will miss looking forward to his amazing product announcements. He was a a showman of the highest class.   I have come to think of Steve Jobs as a close friend and ally in my fascination with the the computer. He will be sorely missed.&nbsp;
 I wish to express my sincere condolences to Steve's family, to the company, to all of his fans and those who have looked up to him and learned from him over the past years. While I may not have known him personally, I too was touched by his brilliance and his great spirit, as were millions of others.  Steve Jobs forever changed our lives, how we live them, how our children and grandchildren will live theirs.... Its the end of an era.  Best of luck to the company, make Steve proud in the years to come...&nbsp;
Gracias por enseñarnos a ser visionarios. Dejas un mundo diferente a como lo encontraste. Que haya Luz y serenidad en tu espíritu y en tu familia.
Steve jobs was a big influence to many people and an amazing and great person to many people and changed the world for techonolgy
Dear Mr. Jobs,  I'll be honest; I've never used an Apple product, nor have I ever had any intent on buying one. I've always been a tech-enthusiast who skirted and dodged around the trend of Apple. But even still, I will always hold great respect for you. And truly, I will miss you dearly. Apple or not, you are an inspiration to all, and there will never be another to replace this hole in our world, much less the one in my heart.  Best wishes in life beyond death,
Dear Steve,  You brought magic into my life. You changed the world, left your footprint, and made it a better place. Your work has caused millions of smiles, laughs and cries. Thank you for your contribution.  You will be missed. 
This is one of the worst things I've heard for a long time, but because  Apple is such a great company I know that they will still be able to  make amazing products! 
 i just want tu say one thing, Steve Jobs was a great man, a brilliant man who changes the way i saw the world and turn it better, i love apple products, im so sad since a read this terrible news, i'm so sorry, the world lost a great man... P.S. i'm sorry for my english im from venezuela
Steve, I owe my career to your vision, imagination and enthusiasm. You will be  missed and remembered fondly.  Rest in Peace.
Dear Steve,  Rest In Peace, You Will Never Be Forgotten. You Were My Role Model, I Aspire to your Greatness.&nbsp;
I'm only a brazilian student but i can tell you that Steve makes the difference in my life! I'm proud of having apple products they make me happy every day. Stay with God, Steve.&nbsp;
My wife and I are so sorry over the loss of Steve Jobs.  Although we do  not know him personally, he touched our lives with his products and his  spirit.  He touched us; he touched the world.  We, the world will never  be the same. Our prayers go with you Steve.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the best and will be missed too much. Steve was so, so smart, he is the reason for Apple. Thank you, Steve - you will be missed very much.
It's a rare thing to find a company like Apple today.  I worked for the store in KC, MO very briefly and wish that I'd stayed, but alas, you can't go back.  More so though, I am a graphic designer and have worked on Mr. Jobs great machines throughout my career and have written more then one business proposal fighting to keep my Mac vs being forced to work on a PC... and Mr. Jobs great work and constant strive for something better stood behind me each time!  Rest in Peace Steve, rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve,    You created a new, intriguing, and innovating world of technologic advancements and standards. You are the American Dream. A wiz kid of sheer brilliance, your genius now stands with such inventing pioneers as Tesla and Edison. Not only were you a man of power and courage in your field, but in life itself. You proved time and time again that you were still a man, a man that could fight, but more importantly, a man that had to fight. Even with the world held by the simple push and swipe of your fingertips, you were as mortal as the rest of us. A marvel that pushes us to be as good as we can, while we have the chance. No doubt your legacy will precede you and continue to grow in your absence, but never will you be forgotten. You have been digitally and physically imprinted into the history of our evolving society. I appreciate what you have been able to bring to my life. I wish I could have impacted your life the way you have influenced mine. If Newton discovered something as remarkable as gravity with the fall of one apple, imagine all that you have unlocked with the creation of the Apple.&nbsp;
I'm saddened and stunned.  I'm a longtime Apple fan and supporter since my first Mac Classic.  I can't imagine what our 21st century daily lives would be like without Apple and Steve's visionary leadership.  I'm awed by his brilliance and will miss seeing his ebullience at the yearly  unveiling of extraordinary stuff, to both delight us and enhance our daily lives  A big loss for us all!  Peace to him and the Apple family...
Dear Steve: Hearing the news, I felt that my world got into darkness. I'm so sad that I nearly don't know what to say. Steve, you will always be my hero. I'm a medical student. It's you that give me the strength to move forward. Goodbye,  my hero, I know that your genius will be shining in the heaven! God bless you, and god bless apple. 
Steve, I ran smack into you six years ago while on Apple Campus, training to be a MacGenius. I hope to run into you again some day.   My first computer was a Mac that my father brought home in 1984. I was five years old. I haven't stopped programming since. I am no longer a MacGenius, but instead a very successful software engineer.  You said that technology doesn't change the world... But I want you to know that at least for me, your technologies, visions, and innovations changed everything.  Thank you, and rest in peace. You will be dearly missed.&nbsp;
No words can express... Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Mortal yet immortal. Steve Jobs will always be in my life I Love Apple, a fan, a customer, a consumer forever
Thank you, Steve Jobs for giving us so much.  Travel well.
thank you for your genius. Your idea was truly beyond this world. May your soul rise to heaven before the devil knows your dead. 
Steve jobs was like the Albert Einstein of our modern time. He was amazing for what he did, bought Pixar and founder of Apple. He's in a better place now. Because of him Apple is the most successful company in the world. 
Everyone in the world knows you are the visionary for most of the  amazing technologies available in this world.  Thank you steve
For A Great Man Who Have Done A Great Job!Steve Jobs would be the only name to greet..Life has been so wonder with the things he madeand all the memories and inspirations he shared. Great Job!! Great Man!!Thanks... Sharing my thoughts for a man who inspires many....&nbsp;condolences to his family.
I will always remember Steve with a smile in my face when he returned Apple for the last time on my birthday to announce iPad 2, that made me took the decision of buying it.
Dear Apple Family- I'm so very sorry to hear about the passing of Steve Jobs.  The entire Apple team, and certainly his family, have my deepest sympathies. If ever a person was worthy of the title "visionary", it was Steve.  The world would not be the same without Apple, and well, Apple wouldn't be Apple without Steve. I'm sure that everyone at Apple, from the corporate HQ to the retail store team members, will take their moments to remember Steve Jobs and his legacy.  I know that you all will do your best to carry on his work and do things as he would.   From all your customers, fans, admirers, and friends, you have our thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;
I would like to give my condolences to Apple. Steve Jobs was an extraordinary man he will surely be missed! 
I feel really sad because Steve is my inspiration, he was one of the greatest man in this last era, innovative as him anyone, the world is what it is cause of him, I can't believe he has left this world, but he will never die, his achievements are so great that it  will never be forgotten, I send a huge hug for his family, And all the apple community, we will miss him, a great person has left this world to become greater, Rest In Peace Steve, you will never be forgotten
It is indeed a very sad dad for Steve's family, for Apple and for the world. &nbsp;Even though I did not know him, I know he was a passionate genius, the likes of which will probably never come along again. We must all continue to support Apple in his honor.&nbsp;
Today is a sad day for all inside and outside the business. Rest In   Peace Mr Jobs, and thanks for your contribution to technology and   beauty, truly inspiring,
I feel shocked after I heard about the sad news, but Steve is never died, his spirit will last forever! "Stay hungry, stay foolish!" Let's stay with Steve's spirit, contribute our part into the world!
Dear Steve,  Though I never knew you personally, I have followed your journey for as long as I have been an apple junkie. You have changed, in the most profound sense of the word, the computer industry from bulky home models to the most elegant and compact devices in the history of mankind. You have developed a new era, preceding all others in social and technological advancements. Not only are your creations classic and stylish, but they are incredibly user-friendly. There is no other way to applaud you, than with speechless awe and wonder. No words can put in mind how influential you have been, and will continue to be. You have changed the world, as I'm sure, for the better.  Thank you for everything, and for allowing me to be a part of this great age.
The design industry owes a lot to you. Thank you for being such a great  inspiration to me and many of us.&nbsp;
 Thanks for putting a ding in the universe Steve. You were a good Man and you will always be a role model for us all. Rest well with Angels my friend.
The world has lost an incredible visionary in the field of tech today. Peace and blessings upon both his personal and work family. We share in your grief.&nbsp;
 I never considered myself a "Mac" person.  Three iphones, 2 ipods and a MacBook Pro later its hard to remember what life was like prior to the age of  Steve Jobs.  My condolences to his family and loved ones.  I hope you find comfort in knowing that his memory and accomplishments will thrive and a moment in history will always be his. His mind of legendary proportions has affected millions and will continue long after his short time here.&nbsp;
Thanks for your vision, creativity, drive and insistence on quality products. 
God bless you Steve - a true patron of design and human progress!
I knew when I was in 6th grade that I wanted to make movies.  I filmed  footage of Star Wars toys in great battles, then I would edit my epic  footage on VCRs, camcorders, whatever I had available.  This lasted for  years, until Steve Jobs made something available to the public that up  until then was only accessible by the rich in Hollywood:  Final Cut Pro,  Apple's answer to Avid, and the first professional editing suite made  available for a low price.  I was given a  Powermac G4, with Final Cut  Pro installed.  46rom there, I taught myself professional editing by  making music videos, trailers, and short films.  Over the years, because  of my experience on Final Cut Pro, I gained an internship in Hollywood,  where I then gained a job as a senior editor.  I am now a senior editor  full time for a national show.  This all leads to one thing:  If it  wasn't for Steve Job's intuition and creative mind, I would not have had  the tools available to me that would open the door to a bright future in  filmmaking.  Steve was an inspiration to me, and a reminder that  anything is possible when you believe it can be achieved.  I owe a lot  to him, for helping someone like me have what I need to make my dreams  come true, and for that, you have my thanks Steve.  You are my hero, and  I thank you with all of my heart.
Just wanted to say good bye and rest in peace although we never met. You have affected my life for better!
Thank you for all of your creativity and forward thinking. I am a better professional because of your innovations.
Steve, you're the best!!! I love the company you built and I will always cherish the vision you had in business and in life. I can't think of a world without you.&nbsp;
Just wanted to say that I am an avid Windows user. I have been using a PC since i first started building computers.&nbsp; I am not a Mac user for a multitude of reasons. But the one thing I will say is that I appreciate all Steve has done for the electronic age.&nbsp; He revolutionized everything he touched, be it computers, portable music devices or phones.&nbsp; He pushed the boundaries of what we are capable of doing, and in doing so made other companies step up to the challenge. I will always praise Steve Jobs for making the electronic age better. Here's to Steve.
Hey Steve,  I've been using Mac computers since my sweet childhood times when my dad bought a Mac IIci. Since that time, I never left the boat : got PowerMacs, iMacs, iBooks, Powerbooks, MacBooks, MacMinis and I'm now typing this from a 2011 MacBook air 11 inches, my best computer so far. And a happy user of an iPhone 4. Heck, my 20th anniversary birthday present was an iPod 3rd gen. :)  Words could never express what you and Apple have done for the world : you have accomplished in this lifetime so much more than most of men can do, or will ever do. You deserve some rest.  Rest in peace Steve, and god bless you. See you in the iCloud, but the later the best.  In fond memories,
There is not a minute of the day that I am not holding a piece of  technology that Steve Jobs created and influenced. It is like losing a  dear friend&nbsp;
For all the wonderful ideas, creations &amp; inspirations you have offered to this world.  I have been, I am, and I always will be a loyal Apple lover!  Rest In Peace.
I have been an Apple fan and customer for many, many years. I am sad to see Steve's passing and my prayers are for his family at this time. I will always remember his influence on computing and technology, I will never own any other type of computer but a Mac.
Thanks for the visions Steve...you introduced me to many wonderful devices! Rest in peace!
I got the news as a text on my iPhone.....I checked the news on my   iPad.....and I am emailing this from my MacBook.....Thank you Steve   jobs for sharing your genius-ness! ?  Your vision has not only changed the world as we knew it but has taken   technology to a whole new level by challenging other companies to   think bigger and better.....but never quite out-doing Apple   products. :) Thank you again Mr. Jobs and I send my deepest   condolences to your family who I know have had a heck of a few years   watching you go thru all this suffering and who will continue to feel   the pain even after you've left this life. :( You will be missed by us   all.
Steve, You have given me more than just beautiful products. You have changed my life for the better. You have thought me a different way of seeing things. You cared for me even to the tiniest detail. Thank you Steve, rest in peace.&nbsp;
It is indeed a sad day not only for Apple, it is sad day for civilized world. Steve's contribution to mankind will always be remembered. &nbsp;
Innovator, evangelist, disruptor and a man who's vision and determined  passion inspired us all.&nbsp;
As I type away trying to figure out what could I say about this man that may not have already been said, well I say that it's because of you I have a love for technology, and for Apple computers. My love for this company began in 1989 when I was just five years old, in first grade and I remember our classroom getting its first computer. An Apple II none the less. From that day forward I knew that these machines would mean something to me and to many others. Mr Jobs to you I dedicate this poem I wrote while in first grade back in 1989.   Roses are red Violets are blue Our class loves our new Apple  and it loves us 2.   That s dedicated to our first Apple 2, and to you Mr. Jobs.   Thank you for enriching our lives, and for creating  "insanely great" devices!   May you Rest in Peace! &nbsp;
Thank you Steve for all the wonderful Apple products that enrich my life every day. You were a true visionary, a one-in-a-billion creative genius, who changed so many lives. You will be greatly missed by all of us who appreciate your work and talent. I hope you find peace on your new adventure. My deepest sympathies to your family, friends and colleagues. I cannot imagine the sense of loss you must be feeling. 
Dear Apple Team,  We deeply share your sorrow, we'll remember him, the world will remember him as the greatest entrepreneur of our lifetime.  Dear Steve,  Thank you for your amazing ideas, your works and your visions.  May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Praying that the family finds God's comfort during this difficult time   of loss. Mr. Jobs has affected this planet with his creative genius.  An appreciative Apple user.   
RIP Steve Jobs-my condolences to the family and the Apple family. Thanks Steve for the creation of all Apple products - u are the best  we will miss you and will never forget you.
 Even though it was done inadvertently, Steve Jobs and his team at Apple created a technology which is accessible and life-changing to people with disabilities. The ipad has been a game changer to many people who are unable to use expressive language to communicate. It has allowed those people a voice at a fraction of the cost of most other voice output devices.  My son is 8 and has autism.  Even though he is verbal, the ipad has been instrumental in teaching academic concepts, social skills, and typing.  It has promoted independence and allowed him to become better organized.  It has been used as a reinforcer to get through nonpreferred tasks.  It's almost as if this device were created just for kids with autism.  Plus, it's really cool.  Drew no longer looks like the "different" kid carrying around an archaic device.  Instead, all the kids want to check it out and play games with him!As we remember Steve Jobs and his numerous accomplishments, let us not forget the impact of technology on communication.  It has changed our life.
Though he was one man, Steve Jobs, changed the world &amp; the way we live.  What a remarkable legacy he leaves behind.  My condolences to Mr. Job's  wife &amp; family, friends and those at Apple.
Jobs was one of the most influential names in the tech industry, and also one of the most well-known business in the world.  He revolutionized computers, phones, music players...and all starting at the age of 21 when he founded Apple.  He was a genius.  Although it may not be of much comfort to hear it, I hope it helps to know that even though Jobs was very sick, he never gave up fighting and continued to try and live his life to the fullest.  At least, he was able to live the last few months of his life as happily as he could.  My condolences to his family and friends.  May he rest in peace. 
"If you spend all your time worrying about dying, living isn't going to be much fun". I believe Steve lived a fun filled life with his inventions and contributions to the world.he gave us his everything and made our lives easier and fun with the Mac and Idevices and would love each and every one not to forget him,continue his legacy and most of all live life.
I'd like to give my condolences to the Jobs family, and thank you for sharing him with us. I first read about Steve in school years ago, the founder of the apple computer, building the first one out of a garage.  He was an inspiration to the world and will be missed.&nbsp;
I like a great many Americans was shocked to learn of Mr. Jobs' passing!  My thoughts &amp; prayers go out to his family, friends &amp; those Apple staff  &amp; team.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to the Jobs family and his extended family at Apple. As a long time pc user I purchased my first apple product in 1996 and slowly my family has migrated over to iPhones, iMacs, iPods and iPads. I know we would not have done that if not for the quality of the product and the vision behind the entire line. To read of Mr. Jobs launching a product or answering questions was always thrilling because for a few moments I could see what was in his mind. Rest in peace.
 A true legend. My prayers go out to his family and friends. Thank you for bring apple to the world... His products and ideas have changed the world forever.Steve Jobs is one of my idols and he has inspired me to be a better person and never give up.
Arthur C. Clarke noted that 'any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic' . While we understand the individual technologies that they are based on, Steve's inventions have brought a little magic into all our lives. We carry them around like giddy students at Hogwarts performing apparent wonders as we go. We rely on them and they empower us. We lost a great wizard of our time. Wands out my friends.  The iphone 4S will become the iphone 4 Steve  My sincerest condolences to the Jobs family and Apple family.&nbsp;
One of the greatest things that i've ever done is to be convince my family to be an apple user. I loved Steve Jobs for what he brought to us from technology to personality. I loved him so bad. R.I.P King of all geniuses.&nbsp;
Mr. Steve Jobs, rest in peace. Your ideas and conquers will always be in our hearts and minds. Thank you for all wonderfull things you did.
 always remember the creator and founder Steve Jobs of Apple, but I remember that Steve was also a devoted father and loving husband. the fight against cancer has been won, only depends on the point of view. Steve rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was truly an inspiration and a classic independent thinker always thinking outside the box and working to make the best products on the market and he succeeded. R.I.P Steve we'll miss you.
Hi....  It's sad to wake up this morning to this news. The world has lost a true genius. Steve will always be the icon of creativity and an inspiration to all young ones of this generation.  His legacy lives on.  The Leonardo Da Vinci and Michelangelo of our time! My condolence &nbsp;
Wow!  I just heard that he stepped down as CEO of Apple last week on  NPR.  What a shock to hear that he passed so quickly.  I am an  elementary school Special Ed teacher and I have my kids learn a quote a  week.  This week's quote is, "Well done is better than well  said."-Benjamin Franklin.  A fitting quote for Steve Jobs, a visionary  worker to the end. My condolences.  
I met Steve for the first time in 1991 at Next computer.  What a great human being and person he was then and continued to be, success never seemed to change him. &nbsp;
We will miss you, your inventions and brilliant ideas in this fast technology and friendliness to loved ones will always be remembered and nobody can replace you.
I am so sorry to hear of the passing of Steve, If it was not for him I would  be using a tablet instead of my IPad1, which I love using, I wish I could trade it for an iPad2. Again I very sad tonight. My prayers go out to the family and everyone at Apple.&nbsp;
To a legend in every sense of the word, you have infiltrated all of our lives and separated us out from the masses.  We have always been proud to be a member of the 5%.  You will be sorely missed.&nbsp;
Steve,  I didn't like Apple because I was ignorant and didn't understand. I made  fun of my grandpa for using a Mac.  Wow was I wrong.  I bought an iPod  in 2004 and it was my favorite purchase ever.  I didn't realize how much  I loved music until you gave me a way to really love it.  Ever since  then, you have changed my life and made it better through the iPhone,  iPad, and Mac computer.  Now, every time I step into the Apple Store or  purchase something from iTunes, it was the best purchase ever.  We will  miss you. 
Great hero and visionary of this century. We have lost a great soul, may his soul rest in peace and our condolences to his family. 
To all at Apple, please accept my sincere condolences for the passing of the great man  Steve Jobs.  I am truly grateful for for all he has given and for all Apple has  taught me.&nbsp;
Hi Steve, I know than U don't read this but I need say this: ¡Thank You!, You change the world and change my life, you're mi idol, I want work in Apple in the future, I'm Mexican and I don't speak English but I tried for write this, See you Steve, the best genius of the history.&nbsp;
This is not about technology, not about user experience, not about new markets, new and better products.  This is about a fantastic human being, whose legacy is simply a better world.  Thank you, Steve 
Being involved with education one can only thank you for devoting your life in bringing technology and creativity to education.  We will always remember you.&nbsp;
Your rocked my world with my first Apple IIe. I built my career using Apple products and innovation. Thank you for introducing some of the greatest, most usable and fun computing and electronic products ever. Rest in peace and god bless
R.I.P. Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) Entrepreneur. Inventor. Genius. Thank you for helping me "think different." "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."  --  "I started with the firm CONVICTION that when I came to the end...I wanted to be REGRETTING the things I had done, not the things I hadn't." - Michael Caine (b.1933) 
  May God Bless Steve Jobs and his family.  I admired him as an innovator, creator and pure genius.   He was an inspiration at so many levels.  His legacy will live forever.  We will miss you Steve.  You will be an inspiration to others forever.   You made a positive difference.....you changed the world...     Thank You and God Bless You.       
Mis más sentidas condolencias la humanidad ha perdido un gran genio. Paz a sus restos.
 My biggest condolences go out to Steve Jobs' family and friends. He   was such an awesome person and will be missed by people from around   the globe. He did so many great things and impacted so many lives,   including mine. I'm typing this E-mail from my iMac at this very   moment. I've used my iPod and have listened to music on iTunes for so   many hours ever since I started using them back in middle school.   Hardly a day goes by that I don't turn on my Mac, the greatest   computer I've ever owned. Mr. Jobs brought us the iPod, iPhone, iMac,   Mac Mini, Macbook (and other amazing computers,) and the iPad, all of   which are owned by someone in my immediate family. Thank you, Mr.   Jobs, and all of Apple who've done so much to change technology in   ways no one else could've imagined. Your ideas have truly changed the   world. Best wishes to Apple. I hope this company continues to do great   things and keeps the spirit of Mr. Jobs alive.&nbsp;
Thank you for your unending vision.  You made the word a better place and truly Thought Different.  You will be greatly miss but it is time to rest.  RIP Steve.  
you were born to create, and your idea will never fade! 
You really changed my life creating electronic devices that are unique piece of art and incredible easy to use. Really it just works! I never wanted a smartphone before the iPhone. iPods, iPads are a must have technology. The Macs are the best computers ever for consumers. Thank you Steve for everything! You'll be missed! That your soul rest in peace.  Condolences to your family.&nbsp;
I am extremely saddened by the news, I feel I lost a dear friend, someone who has been with me for over 30 years, I have bought practically every mac produced, and they have always been my most prized possessions, and they have helped me create everything I have ever created.  Steve was such an incredible person and businessman, I am sure he was also a wonderful father and husband.  I give my most heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.  Steve will always be remembered. <br>
It is just such a devastating news to hear that the world has lost such  and incredible man. All my thoughts and condolences go out to his family  and friends. Steve Jobs, may you rest in peace. 
Steve Jobs revolutionized the way we see technology. He has been, and forever will be, my role model in life. My condolences go out to his wife Laurene and his 4 children. I wish for them to know that wherever he is, they should take comfort in the fact that he died a happy man. 
Thank you for your visionary leadership and commitment to doing things differently. You changed the world over and over again.  Thank you.    
I was terribly saddened to hear of Mr. Jobs death. I, and my family, extend our sincerest condolences to the family and friends of Steve, and hope you will all find some solace in his passing, and celebrate his short but brilliant life. He was taken from us too early. Please carry on with his legacy - I know you will, Our best wishes in this time of sorrow. 
 Thank you Steve Jobs for all of your hard work with apple, visions of the fu ture has come to reality because of your dedication.
I remember a saying that went, "one person's life the world entire".  That saying was certainly true for Steve Jobs. His vision changed the way people communicate, enjoy their leisure time, listen to music and see the world. The greatest thing that any human being can do before they leave this world is to make a difference, to leave something behind that is good and prosperous. And he certainly did that with Apple. My sincerest condolences go out to his family, friends and to everyone at Apple whom I sure have their own inspirational stories to tell of what they've learned from this extraordinary man.
Steve Jobs, a visionary, who added to his high end electronics, hardware and software a deep interest in desing and innovation, transorming us into beautiful humans. Steve Jobs is Apple, is Macintosh, is iMacs, iPods, iPhones, iPads and iTunes, is vision and innovation, is design and trends, dreams and consumism, expectations and products, is life style, is development and legacy, is deep inspiration and creation May you rest in peace Steve, your mission for mankind was accomplished.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp;
I had the 128k Mac with Steve's signature on the inside.  I knew then   that Apple and Mac were going to stretch our comprehension of the   personal use of technology farther than we could have imagined then.  God bless Steve Jobs during his next journey.
I was originally going to study Computer Science at university; because  of Steve Jobs, I changed my mind and decided to study Interaction  Design.  As a result, I have met the best friends in the world!!!  He  really changed my life!!!&nbsp;
Thanks Mr. Jobs,   I really appreciate what you have done.  I found my friend who I eagerly wanted to meet through iPhone.  You will stay within us forever!&nbsp;
Steve jobs was a wise man he is and always will be my hero.
Thank you for revolutionizing the world. Your creative talent and all it has facet will be but one of your smaller legacies. You've challenged us to stand in your footsteps and expand. In remembrance of you. <br>
We were deeply saddened to learn of Steve's passing. Our sincerest condolences to Steve's family - his wife and children -, and his friends and colleagues.   He was indeed a rare individual capable of thinking, doing and being outside of the box - both literally and figuratively.   May he rest in eternal peace. <br>
RIP to the man who changed the entire industry. Truly an icon in this   generation of technology. The world will truly miss him.
Hi ,       I just want to remember Steve as get going guy whom start the company f rom the garage , I have used and program on Apple II e when I was a kid. I a lways amaze myself how I actually did program the computer. I also remember w hen Steve return to Apple the 2nd time , his passion revive the company with  new products and I too rejoin the Apple family with a PowerBook and had sin ce enjoy his passion along with him. More importantly he has now become my " mentor" in passion , his notable quote "Stay Hungry! Stay Foolish!" Rest in peace Steve , you know you have change the world and brought happine ss and passion to many people.  Remembering Steve Jobs <br>
Steve is a pioneer in our time and I  blessed to have been alive in this time. Steve is and always will be the one who changed modern technology of my time. I wait for the day when I will tell my kids and grandkids of how he changed the world. God bless Steve and rest in peace. 
...for your loss.  An amazing, innovative, inspirational individual. I'm a recent convert to the beauty of Apple products.  However, I have always admired how Steve Jobs and team changed and inspired change in technology, education, communication and the way we think. His birthday will be a day that we all celebrate.  Remembering Steve Jobs will be easy; replacing his innovative spirit and inspirational creativity, impossible.  With sorrow, peace and joy.
He was and always will be a legend and Icon in our lives and for future generations to come.&nbsp;
 Having been greatly stricken by today's news, I would like to add my voice to that of every other Mac fan who might not have known Mr Jobs personally, but certainly feel part of this loss his close ones and the whole world have suffered today. I am a 20 year old woman who has been working on Macs ever since I was about 4 years old, my family having owned an LC465, a G3, a Mac Mini, an iMac, a MacBook Pro and countless generations of iPods. I have been a fervent Mac fan forever, and also a great admirer of Mr Jobs.  So, here it is, written from my long-time iMac friend, thank you Steve for your work, thank you for your wonderful passion and inspirational determination to make it, may you rest in peace, and may your loved ones find peace with your departure.
Dear Steve,  I am fortunate enough to be living in this era inspired by your pursuit  of perfection. You are a great mentor to all of us in this world and a  legendary leader to the entire Apple community. You will be long  remembered - old soldiers never die, they just fade away. We all love you and miss you
Everything I have, everything I do is because of you.  My first computer was an Apple II  My career is because we bought the first Mac  My iPhone is my best thing ever.  Thank you for making my life amazing, Mr. Jobs.  Thank you.    
 Thank you Steve for making our lives more entertained fun in a world full of stress and anger... Let's stop the war and find a cure to save great lives like Steve Jobs....&nbsp;
 I remember watching my first video for an Apple product by Steve.  I   will really miss him and have become an avid Apple product user over   the years, and wish Steve's family well during this hard time.  He may   be gone but never forgotten.     
R.I.P. Steve,  your creativity and what you have done already changed the whole world, you broke all the normal rules and gave us a total new path of life, your contribution is lasting forever!!!  Salute! 
I cannot imagine how this world would be without Steve Jobs.  We would be on our beige computer boxes, dumb phones, and clunky user interfaces.  His legacy will live forever and will go down in the books as one of the greatest innovators of our time.  He taught us that computers and electronics can be functional but also sexy.  Steve, you brought sexy back.&nbsp;
To say that he changed the world is an immeasurable understatement... To say he will be missed a gross trivialization... To call him an oracle comes closer... Like the ripples from a pebble dropped into water... His significance will continue in perpetuity...  
Bye Steve!!! You will continue present in our lives and souls...please help God to make a better world.... Humans will miss you! Thanks for your huge contribution to this world.
While I do not know Steve Jobs personally, I do think he is a brilliant man. I remember sitting in Baruch College taking Accounting 101 in 1985- first project was to decide whether to invest $10k in CDs or Apple stocks. I never even heard of Apple at the time, but the number crunching analysis was done, and the decision was to buy Apple stocks. I have been following Apple stocks since and thinks Steve Jobs is absolutely brilliant with how he transformed Apple to be where it is today. His legacy will live on amongst the millions of people using his products on a day to day basis. I love the Mac book and Ipad. Waiting to get the IPhone 5 - thank you Steve for making our lives so much fun away from work!
Unfortunately I never met Steve.  But he has touched my life and the  lives of many others.  He was truly gifted and has left a large foot  print on this world.  His life and memory will forever live on. My condolences to his loved ones and friends. 
Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs. We love you! 
As all the people in the world, we hope wherever you go you find your  deserved rest. Thanks for all the good things you have made for our world, Steve. See you!&nbsp;
It is a great lost not only to Apple, but to the world.He has not only  showed the world a new approach to technology but also given people a  new way of life. 
I'm sorry for this loss. Steve will always be a part of us, in our daily lives, in every technological task we take for granted. He will live on through Apple, just as Apple still lives because of him. 
May he build the next best thing in his next life. 
Deepest condolences for the family left by steve, may you all have the  strength and courage to accept this loss.
Your impact on the lives of billions is undeniable. You have changed the way we view and interact with the world around us. Thank You for all you have done.
Sending everyone at Apple my condolences as you say goodbye to a  visionary who changed our lives in countless ways. We all are better for  the company that he created and the vision of the world that he showed  us. We have lost a beautiful mind and a tremendous human being. Rest in  peace dear one. Keeping you in thoughts and prayers, with deepest sympathy.&nbsp;
You encouraged many people all over the world. One of my best friend passed away last year of same disease 39 years old. I had most hard times for a few years...I admire your courage. You made consistent efforts to make new things. I will do my best from now on. Pray a repose of you..never forget you... 
Thank God for your existence in the world. Thank you for everything you provided for us. In every little corner of the world, at this moment, someone is using  one of your inventions for work, having fun or just enjoying it. Just like  me.&nbsp;
Sometimes It's so painful to accept the truth and feels like we lost a family member, May God bless your family.
I did not know Steve Jobs, but he said something great: "Stay hungry, stay foolish". His spirit and genius will be missed. 
Steve was the father of the home computer...his vision and ingenuity brought our technology to where we it is today. We can never thank him enough. I hope Apple will not lose sight of Steve's unique and forceful vision to bring technology into the hands of even the most technically-challenged among us. Ci mancerai. 
Heaven is about to get some serious upgrades.  May your spirit live on, Steve.
At 48 I finally bought my first computer; I am using it now to type   this letter.  I specifically chose the iMac because of Jobs and how   passionate he was about his work.  It wasn't just a computer to him.    I like the computer soooo much I bought an iPod.  RIP Steve....RIP. 
Love you Steve, It's sad to say goodbye but I do believe God will love you and hold you in his arms Thanks for what you did for people!
My deepest condolences to the Jobs family. the world joins you in mourning. Not only has Steve touched millions of lives through his work, he has also touched many of us at a personal level through the way he lived and the words he spoke. He will continue to inspire generations to come to believe in their dreams, to never give up and to strive for the best.&nbsp;
So saddened by the loss of this great man who made our lives more fun. He inspired me upon his return to Apple. I was  Publisher of ID magazine at that time and  he insisted on running (Apple Ads)  ONLY on the back cover.  In that moment I learned  never settle for less, hold tight to your vision.&nbsp;
I'm a 20 years old graphic designer from Guatemala, and the first thing I desire the most, was an apple product, It was my dream, an iPod, a iPhone whatever, finally I got my first iPod Touch, one of those moments I felt so happy with such a beautiful, creative machine, and all came from that man who created awesome gadgets, such a beautiful design, we lost one of our beautiful minds of present times, a few weeks ago I had a proyect on University of creating a picture of me, being someone I admire, and here it is, It was created on a MacBook Pro while my my iPod is charging battery and I create list on iTunes, Thank you Steve Jobs, I wil always admire you. 
Indeed very sad news. Steve was an innovator in cutting edge technology. Steve Jobs forever changed my life with the iPhone. I still remember the day when it was unveiled back in 2007. I was so excited. Thank you Steve for all the great things you invented and for putting the world in the palm of our hands!&nbsp;
This god was the most amazing, creative man to ever live. His innovations helped change the lives of billions of people. He was my hero and inspiration. I wish I could have met him. It was always my dream to meet him and talk with him. Even though I'm only 14, my dream is to work and collaborate with apple when I'm older. He will always be missed. Thank You Steve.
I remember sitting around with my father and brother deciding whether  the family should get a TRS-80 or an Apple IIe. It was really a choice  between the philosophy of Radio Shack and the burgeoning philosophy of  that young guy in a bow-tie.  Today, we take it for granted that  everyone has a PC. May he RIP peace alongside the Wright brothers, Heny  Ford and Alexander Graham Bell. 
I pass on my sincere condolences to Steve's family and Apple and I am  grateful that Steve followed his beliefs with such conviction. We all  owe a debt of gratitude to Steve and his legacy as a technologist, a  human and a family man will be felt for decades to come.  I'm surprised at how emotional I am about Steve's death. I guess I've  grown up with Steve and his products for much of my professional life  and I feel that Apple and Steve are part of my inner circle, the ones I  can trust. I am grateful for his work helping me be a better worker and  communicator. I'll miss him.
The Visionary and aspiring Prodigy rests in heaven.  
My sincere condolences to his family.  He will be sorely missed.
In 2001 my friend Louis introduced me to Apple, it’s been a one way trip. It’s sometimes hard to explain to people what makes Apple’s products different; how do you explain the nuance of serif and sans-serif font, the click of a keyboard or the lightness of a Macbook Air. Of course, it’s not one of these innovations that makes Apple stand out, but rather the uncomprimising combination of them.  Yes, Apple makes consumer products for relatively wealthy people. Yes, there are bigger problems and greater issues in the world. But, Apple and its undying devotion to perfection inspired and empowered many of us to do what we do today.  It is hard to imagine I’ve much to add to what will be said. Yet, it is however as simple as this; to honour Steve Jobs and his legacy, ask yourself: What would you do with your time on earth if it were limited to 56 years.  Do that, and nothing else, and the world will be a better place.            
My first job was in Apple, my first computer was a Macintosh, my last device  is an i-Pad 2, my son (11) has an i-pod touch 4th generation and my daughte r (6) uses my i-Phone 3GS as her preferred toy! You have made the world happier with your i- Imagination and i-Inspiration! I feel proud to belong to your generation, the generation which saw 1984 masterpiece! You' ll always be in our thoughts as long as the technology you've developed is at our fingertips! May you rest in peace, Steve.
I'm just a normal person, with a normal job, and a normal life.  Steve  Jobs has impacted me, has inspired me, has changed me.  Through his  innovation, his pursuit to never settle, but to produce products and  solutions that go above and beyond what anyone imagined they wanted,  this innovation has changed the way I interact with technology.  How I  use technology in my everyday life.  The iPhone for instance is the  closest the world has been to a truly handheld, fully functional,  computer that allows us to live life in ways we never could before. From the simplest of tasks to banking, all from our hand, from  anywhere.  I, like most, never knew Steve Jobs the man, only the image, the  innovator, the company head.  We are fortunate to have known him in this  way.  Those who get his vision, his ideas for how technology should  server us, who a tech company should produce and innovate for the its  customers, not the other way around, we have gotten so much.  His impact  is felt the world over.  There is no one like him, there is no one to  replace him.  And he will be missed.  Not just as a tech giant, a leader  of idealists, but as an inspiration.&nbsp;
 EM LUTO PELA MORTE DE UM GÊNIO QUE FEZ VARIAS REVOLUÇÕES, ELE SIMPLESMENTE REVOLUCIONOU O QUE CHAMAMOS DE TECNOLOGIA! OBRIGADO STEVE POR FAZER PARTE DA VIDA DE TODOS NÓS.. OBRIGADO&nbsp;
No words will do justice to explain the impact you have had in my life and on millions of others around the world.  I have been an apple fan for 20 years and so tonight I say.thank you.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
 Dear Steve                 you are the best of the best  for me  and i am very   sad  with this news. Thank you for all.&nbsp;
The world has lost the visionary and creative man.     May his spirit, spirit of creativity, great vision, inspire the world forever...     We'll miss him...
You are my biggest fan.  We love you.  You are not alone.  I just wanna say " THANK YOU! "  rest in peace...&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will and in my mind has become the founding father of the modern device as we know it.     He has left an impression on our civilization as so few do, with an absolute drive and determination to achieve.&nbsp;
Few poeple never dies....they live in our talk, thoughts and in dream. They were entrepreneur , they made difference in our life , they gave new direction to our thinking..they just never dies....World will miss them!! 
Being on this earth for only 19 years, I grew up in the digital revolution. I  witnessed as computers went from green text on black screens, to fancy interfaces with colorful icons, to machines that fit in my pocket. Steve Jobs took some of the most cumbersome technologies and made them able to be used by  everyday people. Without Steve Jobs, some of the best technology in the world today would still be just a dream. In fact, I credit Jobs with the ability to write this, as the iOS platform has really pioneered what people can do  while mobile.  RIP Steve Jobs 
Mis mas sentidas condolencias  primero que nada  a la familia de Steve y segundo al equipo apple.  esteve fue una persona de un valor incalculable para todo el mundo. Gracias por todos los aportes, son un legado  maravilloso que dejaste en este mundo. ahora nunca me voy a deshacer de mis productos apple en honor a ti, Steve. personalmente soy un fanatico de apple y estoy muy conmovido con la noticia.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a inventor, a visionary, and a creative genius. He revolutionized technology and the way people live their lives every day and we thank him for it.   R.I.P  Steve Jobs 10/5/11 
Though I did not know Mr.Jobs personally, his innovation and passion for  striving for a better tomorrow fueled my own technological endeavors. My  once PC fanboy mentality found a new path because of the quality of his  work and ambition to make a better product. Apple, will never be the  same without any of his input on products and he will be sorely missed,  PC owner or not. RIP Steve Jobs.
I am composing this e mail on my smartphone. Without the sheer brilliance of Mr. Jobs, what I am doing now would be merely a ludacris dream in a science fiction book. He continues to touch and help people whom he has never even met, but certainly has thought of in his quest to provide the world with the technology it needs to operate. Steve left us amidst troubled times. Without him and his creations, though, the world would be far worse off than we are now. He provided means of education, capitol, inspiration, and entertainment for years and will continue to do just that. His creations and innovations continue to provide thousands of desperately needed jobs all around the globe. While he will forever be missed, his ideas are still with us and will always be the path to greater knowledge and understanding. Rest in peace sir, and thank you. 
I am heartbroken by Steve Jobs's death. He was the greatest guy that I  ever knew. I remember when he introduced the iPhone 4, iPad2, and his  other great inventions. He was amazing. I think that history will never  be able to ever haves such a great person as Steve Jobs ever again. He  was an amazing innovator, and I will miss him dearly.
Thank you Steve for the hard work and genius innovations.  Good karma is  reflective through all the devices you have created.  See you in the  after life.
Today is an incredibly sad day! Steve Jobs is the kind of person that only appears in this world once in a lifetime. He was special. He went beyond the bounderies. He saw what we couldn't. He was a genius. He inspired many. He will be deaply missed. Our hearts and prayers goes to her family, friends and all that had the honor to have met him. RIP.&nbsp;
I grew up around computers. I remember getting my first computer back in the early 80s, a Commodore VIC-20 and later an 8086 PC, though we used Apple II computers in school. I was always a devout IBM compatible PC DOS/Windows/Linux geek and, to tell the truth, I never thought much of Apple's products. Even so, I am deeply saddened to hear about Steve Jobs's death. Though we may have been on opposite sides of the technology fence, he was still one of us and it won't be the same without him.  I wish the best for Steve's family, for his friends and for Apple.&nbsp;
 The world has lost a visionary. An amazing man has left us. Genius like his will never again be known. Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>"Death is only passing through God's other door."</div><div>- Edgar Cayce</div>
Thank you for making my life easier!. There are no words to describe how inspiring you are for us.  The World is yours, Steve Jobs!
You are the legend. I've already missed you. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. :( 
An inspiration to our era via his dedication to his belief and value in life. Every products that he envision and produce for his followers are extraordinary. Each products is a masterpiece which follows his vision of creating the best EXPERIENCE for the users. Not about price....is about VALUE and EXPERIENCE in the way the users have. We shall remember you...... &nbsp; Thanks
Thank you for your dedication and perseverance Steve.  Your idea was truly a unique one, and as a result you've managed to change the world.  May life continue for you in the hereafter. <br>
 The world will remember Steve Jobs as somebody who changed our culture as no  other in recent times. His powerful mind was able to create and to induce creation in such a scale that he definitely became a real milestone in human history.
 Esse foi um dos gênios que passou por esse mundo. Descanse em paz Steve!            
He created what we could only imagine :-) RIP&nbsp;
Not many people in the world have the profound opportunity to change   the direction of human beings on the grand scale.  The ones who are   provided that opportunity usually do not - at least not in the way   that Steve Jobs has.  He is among the few people in this world that   has had such a single-handed impact on us as human beings.  The   effects that he and Apple have had on us are not just ones that we   discuss and analyze, but we get to experience them first-hand.  Any   Apple product that I have ever used is not just a mere object.  From   the time I turn it on, it becomes an extension of myself.  A clean,   clear, precise, organized, navigable extension of my own body.  It is   me, and I suffer from separation anxiety when I am deprived access to   it.  My car does not even come close to the proximity of Apple to my   heart.  Thank you Steve Jobs for driving a company that has made the   world a better place for me.  You've played the game of life ever so   brilliantly.  Well done, sir.
Such a shock.  One expected him to be there always.  If you loved your Apple, you loved the spirit of Steve Jobs.  My heart goes out to the  family, employees and everyone else who is in shock.  The world is so  blessed that he was a part of it.&nbsp;
 Hi...  I want to say that Steve Jobs was the best person of the world of technology. &nbsp;He was so young. &nbsp;He gave us a better future using those inovations. &nbsp;When I read Steve Jobs had died, I was surprised...I almost cry. &nbsp;He was a Freacking Genius.. I hope that Apple continue his legacy... STEVE JOBS R.I.P.
May you vision live forever in a world that is paved with your hand and your gift for innovation <br>
Steve's incredible computers helped me to get through college.  I loved the ease of operation and reliability, and I greatly appreciated the student discounts. My condolences go out to Steve's family. You will be in my prayers.  Much love
 As I type with my macbook, listen to my iPod, and text people with my iPhone. &nbsp;I can hardly believe that the man responsible for all this innovation is gone. My condolences to his family, friends, and coworkers. He will be missed not just by them and me, but the entire world will mourn him            
  He was a visionary, and will be greatly missed.     
Feel really bad about Steve Jobs death .......May his soul rest in peace..... 
May you rest in peace Steve Jobs. You revolutionized the world as well as the way that I see it through technology that seems almost magical. For that I will always be grateful.&nbsp;
I am in pure denial that one of the most famous well known and most  awarding genius has passed away. If it wasn't for his creations  (along with the other brilliant cofounders of Apple Inc.) the music  industry, fashion industry, food industry, and school would be in  impossible to take or to grow. He created the first touch screen  electronic phone and music product. Thank you so much Steve Jobs   You're in our hearts (students, coworkers, family)  Thank you.
I feel like he had my back, even though I never knew him. He knew what I wanted from technology, and from the world.&nbsp;
I believe that there are no mistakes and reality is all there is. Steve  Jobs expanded reality in ways that were unimaginable to only but a few.  God bless him, his life, his work, family and friends. He will be missed  by all who he has touched by his creativity and vision.
To the one that may concerned,   Today is a sad day. Not only for Apple,but also for all apple fans, customers,developers around the world.   Steve Jobs has become a legend of our age. He and his team in Apple has provided us several breakthrough products: Macintosh in 1984,iMac in 1999, iPod &amp;iTunes in 2001, iPhone in 2007, iPad in 2010.   What he offered the world is far beyond these great products.  His spirit will forever be remembered.   Stay hungry, stay foolish.    Thank you Steve Jobs! And best wish for her wife Laurene and his family.&nbsp;
I had the pleasure of working for Apple Computer Inc. for 10 years. I have not worked for a company since that produced not only great computers, but such an atmosphere of team unity and energy! I fear in today economy, I will never work for such a company again!  Rest in peace Steve...
I have been an Apple customer since 1984. I built my first Digital Audio Studio in 1991 with a Apple Computer running the show. Today, A Video Producer and world famous Vocal Trainer, apple products are still at the core of my business. I owe my livelihood to Steve Jobs and Apple. I mourn his loss.  Thank you Steve.
Thanks for all your innovations and how you changed the world to be a better place.  May your soul rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Thank you for your great visionary and inspire in Apple Technology.  R.I.P for Steve Jobs&nbsp;
  The man who contributed so much to the world today rests leaving behind a legacy that will always be remembered. He who transformed the technology and gave us the day of the future do not die today because his history, his legacy should never be erased from the world. Try to imagine a world in with Steve Jobs has never existed, I know is very hard.  The man who made the technology of today's world, not only gave us some new gadgets but that provided to today's life the passion for the tomorrow.  "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish" - Steve Jobs            
I don't know about Steve Jobs personally but i know he was a part of history.   Thanks for everything that you've done to our life.   I will remember you as a great human being.   Rest in peace. 
When you can touch this many people all over the world with a simple idea, you truly are a great man. I do not doubt that he is and will continue to be one of the most influential men of all time. Forever an inspiration to me to just 'think different'. Thank you Steve. 
To the Jobs family and his close friends. The world grieves with you. May you find some happiness in life without his presence. <br>
Steves life will be greatly remembered and greatly missed, I just got my first mac last week and my first iPhone a year ago thanks to his stunning and  inspirational lifestyle, I am 15 years old and i want to pursue a computer  engineering field because of his inspiration to create products that work  like his BUT there will only be one Great Inventor Steve Jobs. 
It is an understatement to say that I am deeply saddened. Just at lunch today we were discussing how Steve is the entire package.  The world has just suffered a devastating loss that I am not sure could ever  be replaced.  God bless you and your family.  Thank you Steve.
We will remember. Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
 A GREAT MAN! I miss you already.&nbsp;
I am very sad to hear of the passing of Steve Jobs, but I know he is no longer suffering.  May you rest in peace Steve Jobs.  The world lost a brilliant visionary.  Apple means a lot to me and my family, I do feel a personal loss of a family member, and I want to thank Steve for all he has done for this world.  This world would not be the same had it not been for him.  I will continue to pray for Stave and his family through this tough time.
With deepest regrets, we mourn the death of Steve Jobs.  May he rest in peace, while he digitalizes and computerizes Heaven.  Our prayers are with his family.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve.  Your vision and passion is inspirational and through it you have changed the way we live our lives and changed our world for the better.   The world has truly lost an insanely great individual today.  Thank you so much Steve, for everything.     
RIP Steve Jobs. Irrespective of one's view of Apple, or you, you changed the computer industry, indeed the world, forever. We thank you for your ingenuity, your dedication to your craft, and your willingness to take great risks to see your visions through. The world is a better place because of you and you will never be forgotten.
You will be missed. May you be resting in peace. Thank you for your vision love Apple products.
I love u Steve. Thank you for everything you did for mankind. Your legacy is  cemented in greatness.
I got to know about Steve's death by my iPhone and I write this  condolences with my MacBook - no other words are necessary... 
To whoever may read this I am a man who would like to send my  condolences to all those who were affected by the loss of Steve Jobs. He  created the company at a great time where video games where dying down  during the north american video game crash of 1983 and the computer  market rose up. He is very inspirational to me as a fourteen year old  kid who dreams to become a video game designer. My dream is to make my  own company and rise up amongst the bigger companies. Without Steve Jobs I would not have this dream and for that I am thankful. I hope Apple as  a company continues to make the great decisions it always has. R.I.P  Steve you will never be forgotten. 
We will never forget you steve, You will never walk alone RIP STEVE.
I'm very sorry for your loss.  Steve definitely was a genius and will be  missed.  I appreciate the great products he created and what a great  company Apple is, as well as the people who work there.&nbsp;
Thank you for your imagination, innovation and sharing your dreams.  Steve you will be missed.   
For the Man, The world has not only lost a visionary, but a man who's vision was  beyond the stars.  A true Midas of his times ! His spirit is continuing thru the ideas he left behind!&nbsp;
Thanks Steve for all the good things u gave to us . R.I.P
Thanks, Steve for all you did to bring wonderful and inspiring design to the entire world. You will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
Bye Steve...&nbsp;
My condolences to the  family and friends of Steve Jobs, may he rest in peace.
Goodbye, Mr. Jobs. We will miss you so very much.We mourn his passing, and wish his family the very best.
I am found of apple. I looked up to steve. I wish could of lived longer and survived cancer.
You have truly make a positive difference in our lives and will be remember forever.
He cared.  Intensely and passionately. He trusted his instincts. He believed unfailingly in himself.  We should all do so well. 
To his family I wish you the best. Steve was only 8 years my younger, but his mind was way ahead of his time. I had one of his first computers and what he started was a miracle. He will be greatly missed. You all will be in my prayers.&nbsp;
I just wanted to say that Mr. Jobs has changed the way people can work  and communicate with each other. His visions has surely changed the  world. I hope he did not suffer too bad. He did not deserve that. Rest in Peace and you will not be forgotten and your work with live on.
Not many people come along like Steve, and when one does it's a great thing, but it is also a great loss when a person like that moves on to the next part of life, but we must remember, where ever they go next, they are making it there as Magical as they did here. 
I never actually met Mr. Jobs. But I remember that ever since I heard of him, I checked his websites regularly. I had only checked apple.com 30 minutes before Steve passed away. Me and all of my friends pray that Steve goes straight to heaven and begins programming with the angels.
My condolences to the family of Steve jobs. He was truly a genius that change the world. God bless his soul. He will be remembered.&nbsp;
My condolences to the family.&nbsp;
Steve,  Your contributions to this world are truly unforgettable. It was an honor to see and hear you conduct your keynotes.  Hopefully I will be lucky enough to tell my children and grandchildren about your achievements one day.  You are a true visionary.  I am confident that you along with everybody else in heaven are playing on your iPad's right now.&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened to hear of Steve's passing. I owe a great deal of gratitude to the man that was the inspiration behind making my life and my job easier. Thanks for countlessly kicking Window's butt. He will be forever missed.&nbsp;
I purchased my first Mac in 1984 and have upgraded over the decades. I'm writing this on my 27" iMac, which I love dearly.  When I heard the news of Steve's passing I was shocked and profoundly saddened. He WAS Apple. No other individual--anywhere--has been so closely associated with a company and the products it produces as Steve.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and four children.  He will be truly missed, but his legacy will live on.&nbsp;
It is such a tragic loss to the world that Steve Jobs has passed away at an early age.  My heartfelt condolences to his family and to his close associates. I sent a message to Steve after he took his leave of absence from Apple in 2009.  That message include the following thoughts of appreciation that I wish I could repeat to Steve today: "Thank you for your impeccable taste.  Thank you for having a vision of what is possible, of "skat(ing) to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been".  Thank you for demanding everything of yourself and of your employees to develop not just good, but superb products.  Thank you for demonstrating time and again that mediocrity is not acceptable.  Thank you for making it easier for me to do the work I have to do, and for making it fun to do what I want to do (and vice versa).  Thank you for showing me how to be a better presenter and teacher.  Thank you for the joy I feel whenever I use a new Apple product and for making me laugh when the product responds in an unexpectedly pleasant way.  Thank you for giving technology a soul, your soul." Steve made a dent in the universe, a big dent.&nbsp;
He was a great man, he made a huge impact. This is a sad day in history, but a great one because he was suffering from cancer. May God welcome him into heaven, rest in peace. 
Hi Steve, Thank you for leading such an innovative and wonderful community at Apple. The products such as iPod, iPad and iPhone have changed the way I thought about music, movies, games and many other cool things on a daily basis. Holding an iPhone and calling it a "lifestyle" is what I do all the time. Thank you and the employees at Apple for this wonderful piece of technology! I also posted this to Facebook in your memory: "R.I.P Steve Jobs - A sad day for the technology industry as Steve; one of the many technology greats passes at 56 years of age due to Cancer. Steve was the CEO of Apple and Pixar and also the creator of the "Blue Box" (Illegal phone attachments). These were only a few of his achievements that should encourage the geeks &amp; nerds out there to be creative and innovative with any ideas they have to create a brighter and better future!"&nbsp;
May his soul rest in Peace 
Sad sad day for me, I've been a mac user for 25 years, he was the constant, we will all miss him, if the world could only have more of these brilliant visionaries.
Thanks for everything! For me it's almost impossible to imagine the  world without apple's products!!!! We'll miss you a lot. 
Thank you Steven Paul Jobs.  You are THE pivotal innovator of our time.  Your insight accelerated human progress.  Humanity thanks you.
I was always aware of Apple computers but I didn't get my first until high school. The way it felt to use such an easy to use and yet innovative software system was indescribable. From that point I was loyal to Apple and anything and everything they strived for. I have owned two iPods and now I am on my iPhone and addicted. I can't picture my life without this brilliant device. Two years ago I stepped into my local apple store and walked out with our new iMac. I remember carrying it into my office and transferring files from my  old iMac g3 that lasted me a solid eight years. It's been two years ago since I did that and I still have that old g3. I idolized Steve for being the visionary and genius he was. He never settled  for just one innovation and he never quit inspiring me. He will me missed and without a doubt will never be forgotten.
Steve was a human being who changed lives and entire industries through his imagination and creativity--there has never been another who can compare. He brought wonder to the lives of ordinary people. I am deeply saddened at the loss of such a visionary.
 Steve, "When you get this message,...I would just like to thank you for making all my childhood dreams come true. Just like the song..."Welcome to the future”, you made it happen for me. :)
This is such a tragedy for the world.  A genius who not only was talented technologically, but his communication style was unsurpassed. His legacy will live on forever.&nbsp;
I really will miss him!
Thanks for encouraging and helping us to use our imagination and push  our creativity forward. Your visionary mind changed the world forever. Thank you. Best wishes to family, friends and co-workers. Farewell from Spain. 
I am so thankful for Apple and more importantly, Steve Jobs. Without him, technology would not be the same. We would be living in the past. Thanks Steve! Rest in Peace. 
 We have lost a great man! May you Rest In Peace and may Buddha bless   you.
Thank you for changing the world for the better, something not often the case with many.&nbsp;
To All, Rest in peace Steve Jobs! We will miss you, and your creative genius  ! Live Long and Prosper Apple
As a Brazilian, living far from the USA I wish Steve Jobs rest in peace. An extraordinary example to life, people, thoughts and creeds.... Very sad....but promise to "stay hungry stay foolish" My sincere condolences to all of Apple family!!!!&nbsp;
we will miss you so much and support apple as before.
Hi, here in Brasil we’re all very sad about our lost! I’m in college, and i've him like my guide. He still be my biggest star. I'm trying, cause I want to be just like him. A biggest visionary of the all world. Everybody in facebook, here, from Brasil, put it in our profile a tribute to him. He was a great man. God Bless his Family and Apple's family.
Whatever controls our universe just inherited one of the greatest human minds that ever lived. He changed my life and I never had the chance to meet him. I'm glad I lived in the time he lived. Thank you Steve, you will be missed.&nbsp;
Thanks you Steve Jobs for inspiring me, for convincing me that perfection is not the enemy of the good, and for making technology cool and approachable!  You will be sorely missed.<div><br></div><div>May your spirit inspire future generations.<div><br></div><div>Rest in peace.</div></div>
A thought to most amazing creator the world has ever known, Love   
God Speed Steve. You left the world a better place. What more can any of us hope to achieve...  
I am saddened by the news that a visionary passed away today. I would like to offer my condolences to the Jobs family and to everyone whose life he changed. Steve Jobs was a one of a kind and he will be missed.
I know there will be countless emails and this one will be lost in the  crowd.  I need to say that Steve Jobs was a superhero to me and he  always will be.  He was otherworldly.  Simply incredible.&nbsp;
Thank u for giving us the opportunity to share your dreams and visions and make them a reality. RIP Steve jobs 
I am so grateful that Steve Jobs was in this world. I have benefitted   greatly from his products, and am sure his memory will never fade!   Thank you Steve! May your memory live on forever! 
Thank you for your courage your inspiration, your ideas, your perseverance, your lessons, your dreams, your life! And what a beautiful and meaningful Life! Steve Jobs and Apple, forever!
I learned about Apples existence when I went to study college at the ITESM in Monterrey Mexico. I was 17th and I, as many others, was engulfed by it.  Steve Jobs was an idol for us, a genius, visionary, .... You say it. But looking back I now know that the biggest reason for what we admired Mr. Jobs for, was that he had, and he gave us a clear vision of how technology should serve us a how, with it, we can have a better world.     My condolences to his family and humanity in general.&nbsp;
  Our thoughts and prayers are with you, your family and friends. Steve  you will be sadly missed
World has lost a great visionary today. All our wishes and prayers are  with the family and his extended family.  May god bless his soul.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You were a great visionary, and although I may have never met you, I  will always remember you as someone that has influenced my life and  pulled me towards a greater purpose and dream.  I will miss you dearly and you will live one with every touch, swipe and  click of your inventions.  May you look over us in that great iCloud in the sky.  -
Dear Steve Jobs, I 've got a lot to thank you for. Your words helped  me. Do you remember? Think Different Campaign? I found this poster in train. I changed my mind  When I saw it.  I wish to express my deep gratitude to you. A lot of Thanks and  Love
The minute I found out that Steve Jobs passed away, I went to apple.com.  It was incredible how the company has already put into a place a way to remember him.  The world really lost an incredible man.  I didn't even know him, but what he did for the world can be seen through the many people carrying iPhones or using apple computers.  It's not the items and the vision, but it was the avenue he created in order for every person to stay in touch with each other face to face, text to text, email to email, etc.  Thank you Steve Jobs, you will be missed.  My condolences go out to his family and friends. 
Uma grande inspiração para mim!  Sera lembrado eternamente por um considerado Apple lover.  Tank you Steve.&nbsp;
Steve was a truly inspirational man.  The world would be an amazing  place if there were more men like him.  He made IT accessible and  interesting to the masses.&nbsp;
I am always saddened when people are taken from this world when they still have so much to give humanity. I am the same age as Steve and it highlights again that one has to pursue one's dreams because life is short.     My thoughts are with Steve's wife and children.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is my idol. :(
 Steve Jobs didn't make phones, music devices, and  computers. He didn't make software. He didn't build landmark stores,  he made keys. Keys that opened doorways people once only imagined  walking through. Steve made the key that opened the doorway for some young  writer to put together an awesome story. Steve made the key that  unlocked the possibility for a middle age woman to become a composer.  Steve made the key that allowed so many college students the ability to  access their first films. Steve made the keys, that unlocked our dreams.The world as we know it today, has been changed. Revolutionized  by an innovator who knows no bounds. Torched, and rebuilt, by a man that  never understood what it meant to have limits. His mark on this world is seared into everything we touch. Our  phones, our computers, our televisions, our music, they all carry his  mark, the mark of improvement.  To so many people, Apple is just a  company, one that puts out great toys and fun products, and makes cool  stores. For those of us who work, or have worked for Apple, it's our culture. To partake in it, to experience it, is life changing. You'd  never be able to put into words what it really means to work for the  company this man built, you'd be too limited. Less then a month ago, I resigned from my position with Apple  Retail, and as I walked out the door I knew with every fiber of my being  I was a better person for the time I'd spent with this company. A  company that wouldn't exist were it not for this one man's ability to  think different. Although I've never met you, Thank you. The world has had a  tremendous loss today.  
Steve is my idol, I love the way he was doing. Unfortunately, he has passed away, the world has lost a genius person, and I have lost a person who can make a miracle. RIP&nbsp;
I am so sorry to hear of the passing away of Steve Jobs. My very first computer was a Macintosh Plus. I loved it. I did so much with that computer, designed quilt patterns, all types of graphic arts for my brand new typesetting/graphic arts business. It was so simple to use and so amazing. Even with that little screen, I loved it. MacDraw was my absolute favorite program, followed by MacPaint. Upon Steve's return to Apple, the sky was the limit. He contributed so much to the world. The world will be a lesser place without Steve in it. I didn't know him personally, but I understand he was an exceptional human being in his private/personal life as well. He was truly a genius in every sense of the word. I feel like a member of my own family is gone. I hope he didn't suffer in the end, and my many condolences to his family and friends. As much as I will miss him, I can only imagine how they will. You changed the world for the better Steve. God Bless and Keep  You, as I know He is now.&nbsp;
There is no other person like him.  -- A true Mac faithful since 1984 
Steve Jobs had become my inspiration before I even got a grasp on the   English language. Ten years later, I use the phone he created, I   cuddle with the music player he first invented, and I send emails like   this with the laptops he came up with. I use garageband to record and   create music on a daily basis nowadays. Don't ever believe one person   can't change the world.     
I would like to thank you Mr Jobs for your iPod, iPhone and iPad. It has helped me in my school times and now in my work times.  Thanks to you my 55 year old dad understands emails and the internet with just a click of the button. (I thought this will take a long time to teach him).     Your innovation in technology is the greatest, thank you again and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
I just want to say how very thankful I am to have an apple computer,  ipod and iphone. I know that without Steve these things would not be as  amazing or even at all if it weren't for him. I just was to express how  sad I am that the world lost an amazing person and a brilliant mind.  He  will not be forgotten.
My condolences to Steve's family, all the employee's of Apple and everyone throughout the world that has benefitted from Steve's vision, wisdom and life. It is rare in one's lifetime that such a person comes into the world and leaves it in such a better state. Steve's contributions toward's technology and how it has benefitted our life's is unmatched. His leadership of Apple and the guidance and vision he provided the company and its employee's is immeasurable. The contributions he has made personally to make the world a better place from a philanthropic perspective are to be commended.  I've had the privilege of meeting Steve several times over the years at MacWorld and several other professional occasions. He was a true hero and idol that will be truly missed.  I hope his family and all of his Apple family know that he is at peace now and his presence will aways be with us!   
Dear Steve,  you have changed the life of me and so many people around the world in  such a positive way!  You are a legend!  I will miss you!  Thank you! 
I just want to say he made an impact on the entire world.  I hope his vision  will live on! &nbsp;Sent from my iPhone 
Only the  future will show us, more and more, how great steve was... 
 Dear Steve,  It's amazing to have had the pleasure to follow your earthly life with all its extraordinary accomplishments.  I'm sure your genius will continue on the other side as well.<br>
 I remember learning how to operate the first Apple computer I ever laid eyes on in 1986 in a public school. The use of a mouse was truly a remarkable innovation for that time.  We mourn the loss of such a wonderful visionary. He will be missed and remembered by the continuation of such a remarkable company as Apple Inc.
Rest in peace Steve Jobs, I never meet you like millions of other people in the world today but we all were touched by how you changed our life's one way or the other with your great inventions and the great things you gave us that has totally changed our life's forever. You will forever be missed and I pray you rest in peace and please do say hi to my dad once you get to heaven..... Rest in peace Steve you will be greatly missed.
Thank you Steve, we'll miss you.
 I felt extremely sad on the loss of Steve Jobs.  Sad...   
Our small family has grown up with Apple products. My children love Apple as I do. Tonight my 15 year old told me of Steve Jobs death with true sadness in his eyes. With so much of our lives influenced by the amazing products Steve made for us, I had not realized how Steve Jobs became part of our extended family. But he lives on through Apple and the amazing things you will do in the future. Thank you all.&nbsp;
You will always be part of an apple product, thank you for everything you did for us and for the future of technology. &nbsp;Good bye and see you later.
I am truly devastated to hear that my role model has passed. I have been  a fan of him for half my life and I am proud to have lived at the same  time that he did. I try to live my life by Steve's quotes and my dream  has become to graduate from college and work for his company that he  spent his life building. He will be remembered forever and his company  and technology will live on in his spirit.
Steve Jobs....  What can be said apart from "thank you"  You have changed my life and the world I live in, more than anyone else I know.  You have inspired us all and have enhanced our lives and relationships between each other and the way we communicate with our technology  You left us too soon, but having done more in your short life time, than most could have done in dozens of like times. &nbsp;My heart goes out to your family and all of our apple fanboys and fangirls who you have enveloped with your excitement and desire for beauty, style and excellence.  The world has lost a great man and a true visionary. &nbsp;You shall be remembered forever and carried with us in our hearts or at least in millions of pockets, through our amazing iPhones and iPads and iPods. &nbsp;Rest in peace. &nbsp;
the biggest part of everyday of my life.....using his machines.........&nbsp;
Thank you Steve.  For everything. 
It's incredible how much of an impact people can have on other peoples lives, whether you even know them, or not. #RIP Steve Jobs
A tribute to a visionary, to a man who made the change he wish to see in this world. That is greatness!  
Dear Steve.  I don't know what to say... But I want to say " Thank you!"
We didn't just lose a CEO, a Visionary, a Perfectionist, a Man who left his hand print on the world, but we also lost a way of thinking, a vision, and a soul. The pain of this loss is almost unspeakable for some and will be felt throughout us all for years and years to come.  But don't forget what we have gained. We've gained an idol, a role model, a new-found freedom and the confidence to say that "status-quo" just isn't going to cut it. Through his footsteps we've seen that the impossible is quite achievable, that "no" simply isn't going to cut it, and that attention to detail and thinking outside the box should be the norm.  He taught me that behind every great design, every great application, every amazing electronic is a person, a soul, a human being, and that the tool and the user are not separate, but can become one beautiful combination. He taught me not to wait for someone else to change things, that I should stand up on my own and speak out against things that simply don't work, even if the world doesn't agree. He taught me that not even I may know what I want or need, but that I have to have faith and take chances to see what I can ask of the world.  I have cried, and I probably will again. At the end of the day, though, I know that we all have the power to be the next Steve. Believe in yourself, trust in what you know is right, and never settle. We may have lost a leader, but we've all gained a little leadership because of him.  You will be forever in my heart, my soul, and my thoughts. Thank you for everything you've done for me.
While I am often critical of Apple (and yesterday was no exception), it’s because I’ve been a lifelong user of their products, and I think I always will be. My first computer, at age 5 or so, was a beige tower with OS 8 and After Dark installed. It fundamentally changed who I would become. No matter what, Apple remains one of the most innovative and admirable companies in the world, and this is in no small part attributable to the philosophy and ideas Steve Jobs had. Say what you may of him, but he was a genius, and his actions have certainly altered the course of history for the betterment of creativity and knowledge. Bob Lefsetz often said that he was the last true equivalent of a rock star we had left in our contemporary culture. I would have to agree. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. You were a hero to me.
He was truly a genius and is a great loss!!!  He had a significant impact on my life and millions of other people.  He has made our lives a little more enjoyable and easier with his creations.  I am very sad to hear this news but I am sure that his legacy will remain  for decades to come.  Thank you for everything!!&nbsp;
Dear Apple and Steve Jobs,  I wasn't always an Apple user. In fact, it wasn't until sophomore year of college that I bought my first Macbook. What I realized was the simplicity and beauty of what Steve had envisioned. My Macbook is going on it's sixth year of life and sure, there's been some cosmetic damage but it still works like new. The ease of use and the innovations of Apple have made my medical school education as easy as possible. From an affordable and reliable Macbook to specific Pharmacology applications on my Ipod Touch, Steve and Apple have ensured that I will be a successful steward of health and well-being and to leave the world a little bit better than when I came in.  My condolences go out to his wife and kids, family and friends. I want to thank Steve for his vision of quality products, his down-to-earth attitude, and his cool, confident demeanor. You've changed my life. You've changed all of ours for the better.  Peace be with you.
Never in my life have I cried over the loss of a complete stranger to me. My heartfelt condolences to his family and all the people who counted him as a friend, a mentor, and an inspiration. You fought the good fight and made a differnce. Thanks to you the world will always "Think Different" and will be better for it.  From a very loyal but sad Apple customer since 1983.
I don't know what to say!!!  I am great fan of Steve jobs &amp; his creation.  Deep condolence.&nbsp;
 First of all this notice left me speechless... I cannot understand how such a great man, an excellent human being, a genuis like him is not with us anymore... I'm an electronic engineering student and he was my role model! I'd really love to work with him someday and now all that dreams became broken... I just want to thank him for all he taught us, and for being an example of life... He wont be ever forgotten!! Wherever you are... Rest In Peace Steve!             
 His spirit will give us force to create a better world with technology, easier yet more beautiful world. I will miss you, you've created history and changed the world indeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;
   With deepest sympathy  I offer my deepest condolences,  I have been a major supporter of Apple products since I first discovered its brilliance, Steve Jobs is my role model, his drive to make a difference in the world has been more than successful. Mr Jobs is a revelation to mankind.  Apple will not be the same without him.  His motivation and his efforts will not be lost within my younger generation. He will forever be an inspiration to us.   May you rest in peace.

You are the man! RIP..you are in all of our heart. <br>
Steve,   Thank you to be present in my life. You did a terrific job.
Thanks Steve, for showing us we can make the most awesome things we can imagine. And to never settle for beige in a world with colors. <br>
In high school, my friends and I would watch Apple Keynotes just to see Steve present the newest and coolest gadget. We always looked to him to revolutionize computers, and we loved the way he presented. We often modeled our own school presentations after Steve's presentation style. We liked to talk like Steve, pretend to announce some groundbreaking new discovery (when in fact we were just presenting something ordinary from the physics textbook), and we liked to think of ourselves as innovators --like Steve.  Fast forward 5 years, and I'm a graduate student still giving presentations. Throughout college I have worked on my presentation skills, and I've always turned to Steve for tips. Keep the slides simple. Be excited about your subject. Blow people's minds.   Just moments after beginning a presentation in my civil engineering class, I received a flurry of texts from my friends about Steve's passing. After I finished, I checked my phone and couldn't believe it. Many people came up to me and complimented my presentation. I wish I could have met Steve to thank him for helping me become a better speaker and presenter.   Steve, thank you for your hard work. You are an inspiration to all of us.&nbsp;
Dear Apple: Today the scienetific and technical world has lost a pioneer in modern computing and digital design engineering. I hope his vision will be carried further by Apple.&nbsp;
DEAR STEVE,   THIS MORNING ON MY WAY TO OFFICE I HEARD YOUR NEWS WITH A BIG GRIEF. MAYBE ALL MOST PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THAT. YOU ARE ONE OF THE MOST ADMIRABLE PEOPLE IN THIS GENERATION. YOUR EXISTENCE AND PERSISTENT PASSION MADE US LEAD TO THE UNEXPECTED NEW WORLD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR BEST EFFORT. YOU HAD A GREAT JOB! AND I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A GOOD JOB IN THE HEAVEN. JOBS! I PRAY TO GOD FOR YOUR RELIEF THERE.   GOOD BYE.&nbsp;
 Speaking as a product design student in college, I was deeply  saddened by the passing of Steve Jobs. Although I never met him, his  visionary approach to design greatly influenced and inspired me. The  world has lost a genius.
We've never met, and now never will, but your computers have altered the way I use a computer and digital technology in my everyday life. I'm not always close to home, but thanks to my Macbook and its camera I've always been able to see and talk with my family and friends, and that makes it all a bit better.  My prayers are with your family Steve, and thank you.
I can't find any words...  But I thought I was going to write this to you.  LC II and BMUG changed my life.  I am where I'm at today because of you.  Thank you so much.  I'll be forever your fanboi.
I'm not one to normally do these types of things. Or get misty eyed in line at a grocery store when I get a text.  But as an owner of an iPad and iPhone. And a follower of Steve jobs since I touched a Mac in 2003.  I can say I will deeply miss Steve as if he were a member of my own family. I 'm deeply saddened by his loss and share the grief with his closest friends,  family, and some other guy like me, taking the time to send an email.  Reset in piece, steve.&nbsp;
This probably won't get read but I feel as if I must write down my thoughts.  I never met Steve Jobs personally, but whenever I saw him speak at any Apple conference, I knew he was talking to me. I knew he was going to be announcing something just for me. I knew that what he had to say was going to change the way the world was around me. He was a master at making sure that he was doing this for "me." I will never forget the first time he introduced the iPod. The audience was thrilled. I was thrilled. How could this device be the end all to CDs? How is this thing going to change how I listen to music? But it did. I became hooked and so did the world.  One of the best memories I have of Steve Jobs was when he was introducing the iPhone. That smile...that joy...that sense of amazement at his own product. I remember distinctly the moment that I, and the rest of the world when "AHHH." The first time he demonstrated the "Slide to unlock" feature. The audience and the world was so taken back by it that he had to do it again! It was just a priceless moment...and the look on his face was worth a thousand words.  We lost a great, great man today. A man, who I like to proudly say, was the Leonardo da Vinci of our time. He has forever changed the world and even though he won't be with us, his legacy, vision and ideas will live on.  Rest in Peace Steve Jobs and thank you for sharing your dreams with the world.&nbsp;
We just lost one of the most influential people of the 20th/21st century. His enthusiasm for Apple products was contagious. I have always been and will only be an Apple consumer for all of my life. His legacy will be a reminder that anyone is capable of great things if they love what they do. Rest in peace, Steve.
 Sir Steve,  I hope you finally found the rest you need. Thank you for my iPhone, my iPad  and my macbook.
    thanks for everything  
Dear Steve Jobs,  we did never imagine that a single man whom we've never met, would have a profound and lasting impact in all our lives. You have changed what many sought, but no one reached since the invention of the telephone and transistor: The way we interact in the modern mobile world of technology.  Steve, we are deeply thankful for your accomplishments and very saddened that you left this world at such young age.  We are missing you.
How much your vision, persistence and courage has impacted me personally and professionally? It's incalculable.  Your work will be part of my everyday life and I will love every second of it.  Thank you Steve.
I hope now that he is more at peace with god insted of feeling all that pain for the many many years. 
Steve Jobs died today. I'm heartbroken by his death and saddened  that I never had the chance to meet him and thank him personally. For  everything. More than almost anyone else in recent history, Steve is  responsible for the state of the world today. Nearly everything in the world with a transistor is the way it is  because of his genius. The state of media, business, and creative work  would be unrecognizable without his vision. Whether you viewed him as a  tyrant, a dear leader, or an idol; whether you were his family, friend,  or customer, we all have a reason to be mournful of his death. A mere two days ago, I was hired by the very company that Steve Jobs  birthed, later saved, and finally raised to world changing significance. I will  cherish for the rest of my life the knowledge that for two days he was  my leader as Chairman of the Board. Apple will never be the same without  him, but his greatest legacy will always be the people he left behind at  Apple. Steve Jobs will never again be seen in person roaming the halls at One  Infinite Loop, or visiting one of the many worldwide Apple retail  stores, or living in Palo Alto with his family. He will, however,  forever be seen in every Apple employee he surrounded himself with, all  of the products he helped create with his unique vision, and as the very  heart and soul of the technology industry. I will never see Steve Jobs directly in my time working at Apple. But  indirectly, he will surround me. His legacy is inescapable and  immeasurable. I am very excited to be a part of an Apple and a world  after Steve has left us. His work and creations are a foundation. I hope  we can all learn to be a little bit more like Steve: wildly passionate,  obsessively dedicated, and willing to think differently. If we can do  that, a world full of beauty awaits us. My sincerest condolences go out to the family and friends of Mr. Jobs.  The general public understandably mourns the death of celebrities, but  we can often forget that there are real people with very real broken  hearts who have lost a best friend, a husband, or a father. So Steve, rest in peace. And thank you. 
To his family, I wish to send my condolences. I remember meeting Mr. Jobs before and he was such a humble person and he's Influenced my business ever since in many ways. 
I think he is in a hurry to take this Apple to the universe, imoon, imars :) what ever, but we miss u Steve, And i remember how to fight the world from your steps. thank you for everything U did for us. thank u.....
I really don’t know what to say. I am really sorry for this loss for the humanity.  steve you will be missed.  I wish I have met you and say face to face.  thank you.
Hello Apple:  I would just like to say what an inspiration, motivation, intelligent,  and great person that Steve Jobs was.  He innovated technology forever,  inventing the device that most kids listen to music on, the iPod.  He  invented the iPhone, iPad, and Mac OSX.  His ideas and thoughts of how  things should be were fantastic.  His ideas of products were  unsurpassed.  Steve Jobs was and is the Father of Apple, and now it's up  to Apple to continue where Steve Jobs brought the company, and always  remember his thoughts and ideas.  Steve Jobs will be dearly missed, and  I just wanted to say my condolences to the Jobs Family and everyone else  of Apple.  R.I.P Steve Jobs
Thank god for your ideas, it's a inspiration for the word in the past, present and future!  Peace  Saludos Cordiales.<div><br></div>
So long Steve Jobs!
The world never be the same without a genius like Steve Jobs, for sure  the best things ever in Apple history. Farewell Steve, Godspeed.&nbsp;
Let's be inspired by his genius and use the tools he's given the world to write great prose, compose beautiful music, create great art, and share it with others.&nbsp;
 We all die but only a few of us ever really live. It will always be said  that Steve Jobs Lived.
It’s ironic how so many people are posting about Steve Job’s death from their iPhone's... No words can describe how much this man has done for the whole world. Before he came up with the idea of personal computers, no one thought they would ever need a computer for themselves. Even when he came up with the idea for a personal computer, companies laughed in his face. Steve Jobs modernized the everyday lives of an average person. Just think about the amount of times someone uses a computer to check something personal, and realize that without Steve, it wouldn’t be possible. Remember when a computer was used for calculating artillery shells? Remember when computers were used as giant calculators? Remember when computers burned holes in pieces of paper to save information? Without Steve Jobs, we might still be at this level. Is it possible to imagine a world where Steve Jobs never lived, and the personal computer was never invented? I can’t seem to imagine where exactly we would be as a society. R.I.P. Steve Jobs, you have modernized this world to the extent of comparability of Thomas Edison. You will go down in history as one of the greatest to ever live, and will never, ever be forgotten.
When I was a little kid, as part of a loot bag at a birthday party, I  got a colouring book about the future. I coloured in flying cars and moving sidewalks and happy people lounging  around with what I assumed were lemonades but were more likely gin and  tonics. The flying car didn't come, the moving sidewalks are reserved for  transit hubs and we have less and less leisure time while we work harder  and harder.Uncharacteristically, as we were the last family on the block with a  colour TV or FM radio in the car, my parents bought the first Mac and  I've stuck with Apple ever since. There was a point there when I thought  maybe it was just another computer company and that my allegiance was  merely habitual. But then came the iMac and OSX and the iPod and, finally, the iPhone.  Apple had its groove back. And when I first held that first iPhone, I thought: we don't need 3D  traffic jams, I'm happy to walk most places and I find my leisure in the  work I've created for myself. But this here iPhone - this makes up for  all the future promised in that colouring book that never materialized.&nbsp;Thank you, Steve Jobs - and your whole team - for delivering that future  with so much of a sense of fun, of style, of wonder.&nbsp;
He changes my life, the way i think, the way i do, the way i love apple like  it in my blood.. Thanks for everything father..we love you&nbsp;
:( Dan 
At a very young age I began my career in technology on an Apple II+  computer. My passion for technology is driven by the positive changes it  can make in people's lives. Bringing people together, capturing moments  in time and sharing what can be learned inspires me. I know that many  people, bright and imaginative, helped to shape the past and guide our  future, but Steve Jobs brought them all together and provided direction.  Thank you for being an inspiration to me Mr. Jobs and to his family, my  deepest sympathy.&nbsp;
When I was a child, I remember movies and tv shows that depicted how  life would be like in the future.  I can think of no other person who  led the drive to make those futuristic ideas a part of my reality. I own and work from several Apple products as well as products that  exist because of Steve and Apple.  I also help people with their Apple  products.  I thank Steve and the people he led for contributing to part  of my career, and for the tools I use. Thank you!&nbsp;
When I found out about his death, I felt like I lost a close friend.   Even though I never got the chance to meet Steve.   Owning the iPad 2, iPod touch and Macbook, I feel as if he   personally made these amazing electronics for me. Thank you so much Steve for bringing light into my life. No one could   ever replace you. I hope that you are in a pain-free paradise right   now and forever. You are one of the most amazing role models that ever walked the face   of this planet, to me. Not only have you left people that love you in several ways, but you   have also left your talent and it will be forever treasured for   generations to come. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
U r my hero!!! Without u, there's no touch screen and iPhone. Rip Steve.
Thank you Steve Jobs for all of your great gifts that you have given the world! You will be missed by many R.I.P.
Brilliant, brilliant man.  My 3 year old can flawlessly navigate my iPad, and my iPhone. Only brilliance and ingenuity could make that possible.  I can say that in my lifetime I was lucky to witness such a brilliant inventor.
I will stay hungry and I will stay foolish for the rest of my life.  Thank you.
Just found out that Steve Jobs has passed, he fought long and hard with his battle of cancer and now is in a better place, cancer free. He will be remembered by many and totally changed technology and it's impact on mankind.
 Our world will be a poorer place going forward.  Sad to hear the news. 
Somebody said. The reason that everybody grieves in Jobs having died is not about his past achievements  The reason is because we were not able to watch the surprise that he will do from now on.  That's right. We know. The world lost a great person.  I have never met him. But I am very sad.&nbsp;
I just wanted to say that Steve was a great man. I wrote a research paper on him in college a few years back and inspired me to get a degree in IT. His contributions to technology were invaluable. I can say that as a Mac user I won't forget him. Thanks for the devices I use every day that enrich my life and make it easier technology wise Mr. Jobs.
Thanks for what you have done to the world.  Goodbye Steve.&nbsp;
Steve jobs is my life of hero.  Rest in peace.  You will be missed.     Good bye.&nbsp;
Thanks for allowing a person who never met Steve to still write and  express how essential he has been to so many people in this world.  He  has really and truly changed the world for the better, and I admire him  for his drive and commitment to excellence and vision and cheerfulness  and his sense that the world could always be improved.&nbsp;
We may have lost thousands of jobs over the last couple of years, but now we  have lost our most beloved. We will miss you, Steve.
This world is a better place due to the work done by Steve Jobs.  His  passing will never surpass, what we have gained from his living.  Good  bye Mr. Jobs and thank you.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to Steve Job's family and Apple Inc.&nbsp; God bless his soul and may rest in peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;
 Such a sad day.  Steve Jobs will long be remembered as an amazing and inspirational man that truly made an impact and changed both the 20th and 21st centuries.  To me personally, I will be forever grateful for what he has brought into my world.  Thank you Mr. Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for all the innovation and we will miss you, your genius and creativity.
My condolences to the family and friends during this difficult time.   Mr. Jobs changed the face of the industry and set the bar so high.  I  thank him for his contributions and for the teacher he was.  May he live  on in this company and expand his vision further than he could ever  imagine. 
   We Filipinos, specifically the people of Dipolog City, would like to express our deepest sympathy to the family of Steve.     May he rest in peace.  
I am in pure denial that one of the most famous well known and most  awarding genius has passed away today. If it wasn't for his creations  (along with the other brilliant cofounders of Apple Inc.) the music  industry, fashion industry, food industry, and school would be in  impossible to take or to grow. He created the first touch screen  electronic phone and music product. &nbsp;thank you so much Steve Jobs. &nbsp;You are in our hearts (students, coworkers, family)  Thank you.&nbsp;
I have been a Mac user since 1984 when I bought my first Mac 512 and have since purchased 6 more, my latest was just less then two months ago with my new mac book pro.&nbsp; I thank Steve for his innovation and building&nbsp; an&nbsp; incredible company always looking forward,&nbsp; He will be truly missed.&nbsp; A true giant in the business world.
I didn't know Steve Jobs, but what I do know is that the world will miss him.  My prayers go out him and his family.&nbsp;
There is much to say about a genius who not only brought us new  innovative machines but foremost made us sensible for a better view on  technology whom which we communicate, create and work. Be he also always believed in keeping it simple and easy. Therefore,  thanks for all your passion and vision...there are more things to come.  We'll always think different.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,    You are an inspirator, innovator, and a great businessman. I don't work or seen you but I remember when Apple was in trouble back when the stock was $8. The turning point was when you invented  the iMac. I think you built great company, and the company is where it is because of you. Thank you for inventing all these new devices, and business models.   May you rest in peace. 
Soy un usuario de mac y gran admirador de steve, que me inspiro a ser mejor siento mucho la perdida de tan excepcional  persona ya que para mi el era mi héroe,  deseo que desde donde este siga siendo una inspiración ya que aquí siempre lo será y aprovecho para enviar a sus familiares pronta resignación y estamos con Uds. solo resta decirle GRACIAS!!!!! 
I'm deeply saddened by Mr. Steve Jobs' death. Now every time when I look at my MacBook or iPhone, I will always remember the legacy Steve Jobs left behind. I send my condolences to Mr. Steve Jobs' family and hope that the pain will diminish with time. He will always be remembered.
To his family. I am very sorry for the loss.  I love and use the products he helped create on daily basis and they  make my life better. Thank you, Mr. Jobs.
Now my life is fun with Mac. Steve is my idol forever. Thanks.
 Steve Jobs changed the technological world as we know it. With his determination and innovative ideas he truly was the best CEO the world has ever seen. Leading Apple into great success over the years. From the very beginning I have been an Apple girl, I have everything from the very first iPod shuffle to the latest iPhone 4 and this is because of Mr. Jobs himself. He was a man of great wisdom, motivation, and kindness; he will be greatly missed throughtout the world. I send my condolences to Mr. Jobs' family. Steve, may you rest in peace.
The world lost a pioneer today.  Thank you for standing up for what is   right.  Thank you for showing the world that it is possible that   brains, creativity and innovation ahead of profits and the bottom line   can change the world for the better and improve the quality of life.    You were not only an example for all future technical engineers, but   for all future CEO's.  Thanks for letting us ride that ride with you.
I'm only a couple of years older, and therefore "grew up" with Steve.  His vision for the future of tech was astounding. His insistence on  highest quality was legendary. His marketing prowess was genius. Apple  has enriched my life, and Apple and its imitators have enriched perhaps  several billion others. I use Apple products he had a big part in since  the Mac Classic, and have encouraged nearly everyone I know to do the  same. Yes, I'm a "fanboy" and a huge fanboy of Steve. Had he never  lived, my life would be much different.  Thank you, thank you, Steve. Typed on my 27" iMac.
Keep dreaming.
My thoughts and condolences go out to everyone who is mourning the death of Steve Jobs, my hero and role model since age 11. I am now 13 and even though I have no connection to him, I will be mourning over his death.                                           R.I.P Steve!
Dear Family of Steve Jobs Dear Apple Family, I'm just a lady in my 70s in Texas, and I'm crying at this news. Crying because I'm so grateful for your gifts to our world, to humanity.  You have made technology an art, an expression of human culture, and have made art and creativity part of the world of "maths and science."  I hope people will see that and learn from your example, that our society will create schools and environments that nourish that sort of creativity across the board.   Thank you.  May God bless you and guide you on your journey "home" and may your family be loved and protected always.&nbsp;
Steve and friends,  You shaped so much of the world we have today. As much as any one mind ever could.  I never met you but I am filled with sorrow. I am a film director on a shoot in central Kansas sending you this from an iPad. It's amazing how much of my world has been effected by you and your company.  It's incredible how much our crew is affected right now. That speaks volumes about you.  Thank you for your brilliance in all facets of life. I learned a lot from you.  Your standford speech shaped my life.  Tonight we cheers to you sir.&nbsp;
Steve was truly a visionary and an inspiration.  Please forward our condolences to Steve's family and friends.&nbsp;
God has called one of his greatest creations home. Steve was in the same category as Henry Ford, Albert Einstien, Thomas Edison, Bill Gates, to name a few, he was put here on earth to make our life better. Earth will miss you. Rest in Peace Steve.
Words would not do justice to the immeasurable contributions Steve has made to the world, right down to my world as his revoluntionary products have brought so much joy and improvements into my life.  Thank you Steve for being the brilliant man that you were, and though the great loss that is felt this moment may linger and fade with time, but your tech brillance will last through the ages.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve will always be remembered. He is the reason I'm learning how to program and the reason my dad learned. We have numerous Apple computers in our home all because of the legendary OS he created. Mac OS X. My dearest regards go out to his family. 
You were a role model and a leader to all of us.  Thank you. 
Today we all lost Steve Jobs, not just the technology industry and not just those of us who own iPods. We all have been impacted in one way or another by this legendary and irreplaceable figure. He changed everyone’s lives and the course of the entire world in a matter of about 15 years. He changed the way we interact and communicated with each other in ways that will have repercussions for generations.  I will never forget the profound impact he had on my life, he was a mentor, idol, and above all a great human being.  iWill Never Forget iMiss iMourn iCry iWill Never Forget...&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs will always be an inspiration in my life and countless others.
Steve Jobs. I look at him as the creator of modern technology as we know  it. Steve was one of the greatest minds of our time. I wish all the best  to his family during this unimaginably hard time. I know Apple will  continue to be an industry leading company and their products will  always have a place in my life.
My first experience with a PC in school was with an Apple computer. My condolences to everyone at Apple and Steve Job's family. Truly a visionary!!! 
Deep condolence to Steve Jobs who is the best innovator. We'll miss you.
Steve Jobs epitomized the height of American exceptionalism. He did not wait to be told what to do or how to do it, and did not sit around begging for government handouts to support his company or industry. Individual determination, self-reliance, creativity, innovation, vision, leading from the front, and a willingness to defy convention were inspirational American traits that Steve demonstrated to the world.
 I remember our first computer was the original Macintosh.  We had tried  to convince dad to buy an Apple 2, but he held off.   Once he saw the Macintosh, he was hooked, and so were we.  It was so easy to use and had  that razor sharp screen.   Jobs was demanding, but it paid off.&nbsp;
My heart goes out to the Jobs family. He will truly be missed. He was a  technical genius. Thank you Steve for sharing  you wonderful ideas with us. We will never forget you.&nbsp;
I've been using Apple products a long time now and it always felt good  to know that Steve had a hand in making it the best products and designs  in the world. I followed Steve with passion and we will miss him very  much. I missed him already after he resigned as CEO and now that hole will  be forever.  RIP Steve  
You were such an inspiration to the world. You were the real life Superman of technology. Thank you for everything my friend. You will be missed. My heart goes out to you and your family.  R.I.P.  Thank you Apple for letting me send this. 
Steve Jobs changed my life, shaped my life, and helped me express my life in ways I'll never be able to adequetly list.  I hope he is at peace.  Thank you Steve Jobs.
 I salute Steve Jobs  for being an inspiration to children who have been  adopted by showing  them that everyone can find their true path.&nbsp;
This is a very sad time. My life was made easier because of this man.   My work and my day to day living has been enhanced because of Steve   Jobs. He will live in us forever and never be forgotten.
I don't own a Mac, have an iPod or iPad,     But today is one of those days when people will ask of you in the future what we're you doing when Steve Job's passed away, and you'll remember.     We knew he was ill, we knew that one day this would happen but I can't help but be shocked, Steve was/is/and forever will be one of the world's great visionaries.     The world became a smaller place, a closer community because of him, and now it just feels so empty. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
I am shocked. the world will miss his vision and character. God Bless steve Jobs.&nbsp;
 Today died a genius who revolunized the world. It is safe to say that everyone's lives changed thanks to his innovations. He will be greatly missed, but Apple will continue his legacy.
Out of nothing building the most recognized computer company is an absolutely amazing feat. He did not get enough time to enjoy the results of his work. May you rest in peace.       
Steve, thank you for never stop dreaming.   RIP
Well miss you Steve. I will love you forever and ever. You have created the most amazing technology...R.I.P.Steve Jobs 1955-2011 &nbsp;
The World lost a Modern Age Tesla, an inovative genius who did plenty for IT. We were lucky to live in his era.  Rest in Peace Steve...
Mr. Jobs was a great contributor to everything modern technology stands for. A true pioneer, innovator and visionary.  He will be deeply missed.
He will always remain an inspiration to millions across the world.   As he said, 'remain hungry and remain foolish'.  
I worked in Apple as an intern this summer. Though I never got to meet Steve in person (that is now a pity of life), I heard a lot about him while I was there, and was truly, deeply impressed by the amazing company he created.  Thanks Steve for your talent and passion, for those wonderful products, for bringing us a better world.  Rest in peace.
I would like to thank you Steve for changing our world.   I do remember my very first and second computer which was an Apple.  Thank you for making our lifes better and easier.  You may be gone but you will never be forgotten. My condolences to the family and everyone who is an Apple fun as I am!  Rest In Peace! 
I am so sorry to hear of Steve's death.  I'm one of those non-nerd people who have appreciated the intuitive interfaces of the MaciIntosh, IPad , etc for many years.  Steve was a genius!&nbsp;
 My deepest condolences for the death of Mr. steve jobs we are left with the great things he did.            
I would like to say thank you to Steve Jobs who had dedicated to the world for his entire life. His contributions are very appreciated. May he will RIP. &nbsp;
Prayers to the family of Steve Jobs-thank you for sharing the man you loved with the world.
Thank you for creating the most amazing and innovative products. I am a graphic designer because of my first Mac, an iBook G3. You've inspired us to think beyond the box and to pay attention to the simple details that make every day things, extraordinary. Thank you Steve Jobs. For your vision and what you've made, that allowed us to create and share beyond what we've thought possible. Today the world has lost an innovator and genius. Very very sad. Sending out my condolences.  Always inspired. 
Many thank Steve for the products he innovated, while that is important, he was a pioneer in innovation. He was a wonderful family man, CEO, and various other characters. I wish to thank whoever was important and influential in his life because without him we wouldn't be where we are in technology today. I  offer my sincerest condolences. Thank you.
Keeping the family of Steve Jobs in my thoughts and prayers. So sorry for you loss. R.I.P. Steve. 
To any family members and friends of Steve, I am so sorry for your loss.  Steve, You literally changed the world. You will be missed by everyone. 
Steve Jobs touched all of us. Our deepest sympathy to his friends and family.&nbsp;
Dear Mr. Jobs,  I was very shocked and saddened by your news. You have been such an inspiration to many others, including me. You have influenced me in every way. You are just like a candle, lightened up till the end. Your selfless act has pay it forward. You must be smiling now when you look at how everyone around you paying tribute to you.... I wish you all the best and may your legacy continue to inspire many others! May the almighty Lord bless your family and bless Apple Inc to continue be innovative and excel beyond your leadership! Amen!&nbsp;
I never had the privilege to meet Mr. Jobs, but I feel as if I knew him  through the Apple products I have owned.  The man was a visionary who  never gave up on his dream of making technology human centric. He was  one of the few to truly change the world.  RIP, Steve.  You may be gone,  but you will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
Dear Steve   I will always remember you!!    See you in next life.
Dear Steve,  I feel like my Mac has lost a dear relative...maybe a father figure.  To  me, Macs have always had a fun, playful personality, a  youthful entity  that could get any job done with half the steps and with more finesse.   Thank you Steve Jobs for making my job and computers more fun.  You were  a true visionary.  May Apple continue following the bold path you blazed.  I will never  forget.
We are simple users of the technology that Steve helped create and we   will always be indebted to the man and his great vision. May he rest   in peace!! 
My deep thoughts go with Steve's family, that includes Apple and all of those that he touched while in this world.   One of my first computers was a Mac, back when working for my undergrad in Venezuela. I didn't touch another Apple product after I was at Stanford, working for my PhD in Geophysics.   I had the privilege to spend my last months at Stanford living in Cupertino, right behind the school, next to Apple headquarters.   Today, there is not a part of my professional and personal life that is not surround by one of Steve's creation.   My deepest thoughts go with all of you, we have lost a great mind and a person able to move humanity to infinity and beyond.&nbsp;
As an entrepreneur in a different industry, living in another side of the world and brought up in a completely different culture, I too am indebted to Steve's inspiration. Live on, the Apple legend, and continue to inspire the world as you've always done.  
Steve Jobs showed us and built the greatest establishment of our world. I am not speaking of Apple, a Macintosh, an iPhone, or an iPad. I am speaking of proving that the human is able to survive if it strives to do so and with it the human can do far more than what we think it actually can do.  I will never forget this day...  Tears are being shed amongst me and my friends... this is a day I never wanted.
I send my deepest condolences to the Jobs family and to all his close friends. Innovation is what distinguishes between leaders and followers…and Steve you definitely showed that to the world. Thanks for all the the pleasures and joys you have brought to my life and to millions of others. You will never be forgotten&nbsp;
The world just got a little dimmer and a lot smaller. Steve Jobs was the greatest inventor of our time, a real life Tony Stark. I feel incredibly sad and can't stop the tears from falling. Wishing him success in the next life as he had in this one. 
It's a sad day for so many. Steve Jobs has changed the way we do so many things. Music, texting, computing etc. I credit him for my interest in the field of graphic design. Any and all work that I do and have done is done on a Mac. I still have a ruby red G3 that I started with about 10 years ago. Best wishes to Apple and the Apple family.&nbsp;
With gratitude, I remember Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs was my hero. Insanely great. One of the crazy ones.  With gratitude, I remember my hero. A genius. A visionary.  An artist.  A businessman. A father and a husband. He thought different.   Magical and Revolutionary. The universe has shifted. Steve Jobs has died. I am grateful for the gift of Steve Jobs. He is my hero.    
I'd like to express my deepest regret that Steve has passed away. My  thoughts and prayers go out to his family, friends, and coworkers. He  will be deeply missed.  Thank you Steve for all of the wonderful visions, ideas, and products  you have shared with us all. You changed the world and inspired many.  May the Lord bless you and keep you.
It hit me as if I had lost a person who was close to me, someone I knew very well, yet had never met, never even seen in person. Its amazing how much  Steve Jobs has touched my life. Not only in the way I communicate with others everyday, but the way I feel about communicating with people. I do not think I am very savvy in the technology world of gadgets, but when I hold, use, purchase an Apple product, it makes me feel good, and proud that Americans made that product. He was a visionary that I will miss.  Thank you Steve, for having the vision, forethought, and balls to make the  greatest products that touch my life daily.
You were like a bright, shining, shooting star that lit up the whole world. Through the magic of your genius and imagination, You showed people how to dream and how to imagine. May you always be at Peace and may your family be blessed.  May God bless your spirit, Steve.
Steve,  Thank you for making all of us life better.
 Steve Jobs made me a brighter individual.  I stress the word 'individual.'  The ideas that he brought to life through Apple Computer inspired me beyond the teachings of any classroom.  Thank you, Steve and Apple for everything you have done for this country.  And the world.            
 For my iMac, Shuffle, iPhone, and iPad I am incredibly grateful for the joy, pure pleasure and ease they bring to my life.  I'll always be grateful for these products...all the result of his intellect and creativity.&nbsp;
What a great man; what a great mind and what great loss for us all. Steve Job's passing is felt around the world.  We will miss him dearly. His genius has made all our lives better and more interesting.  Job well done Steve, and thank you.&nbsp;
Thank you for your imagination.  Thank you for your innovation.  Thank you for connecting me to my world.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
Steve, your innovations and genius shaped the modern world.  Your influence is and will always be worldwide.  You will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,     Great ideas come from not having fear on changing the way things work. Imagination and motivation are some of the things you've given people like me the strength to perform.  Technology isn't something you create, but something you imagine. Your imagination made difficult tasks, easy and fun to deal with. For all the things you've done, a job well done. :-)
The world has lost a very special man!
May this time of grief slowly be overshadowed by the fond memories of a  truly great man and may his ethos be a guiding light for Apple as it  opens this new chapter defined by his passing. &nbsp;
God Speed Steve!  You can now rest easy knowing you changed the world!&nbsp;
Today we have lost a real leader and a visionary that made it where nobody else has ever gone, Steve made every keynote something extraordinary, every Apple product so unique, that maybe thats the reason why I bought my first iPod Steve will always be reminded as a leader, a visionary but above everything,  as a friend that I never met.
When I first started my business in 1981 I used an Apple Plus, then went to   an SE, then a Mac 2, it really helped me, and the Ipad is my wife best  companion  now, Rest In Peace SJ, you made the world a more better and  more  connected  place.&nbsp;
May your soul rest in peace Steve.  To the family my deepest condolences.&nbsp;
I felt like we have lost a family member. We were so used to see him on  Apple site. It is a great loss to the world.&nbsp;
You have been a great source of inspiration for me! may your soul rest in peace!
Steve you will be missed.
Dears,      I’m so shocked that Steve has left us this morning. Steve has totally changed the world and I feel lucky for being part of the era he has changed. Steve always inspired me for his passion, his style and especially his strong desire to change the world, though I never saw him face-to-face and could only watch his videos in Mac World.      After I watched the video he gave a speech in Stanford, I was completely influenced by his positive attitude on pursuing what he love and following his heart. “Stay hungry, stay foolish.” As he repeated, he indeed inspired the potential of countless youth in the world to explore the possibilities that could make a difference, especially in China.     Steve will always live in my heart and consistently encourage me to listen to my voice in deep mind and follow my heart.&nbsp;
Thank you so much for being devoted to creating technology and instruments for the creative individuals of our time.  Your products and atmosphere have always been inspiring, and have allowed me to unleash my imagination in so many visual ways.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for creating my 1st real computer, the Apple IIe, to many of my favorite products since. You will be missed.
Wishing you a beautiful journey into the universe. &nbsp;
My life on this earth was better because of Steve Jobs.   RIP!&nbsp;
I have always loved apple from the very first Mac classic to the   newest Mac Pro. It has inspired me to do great thing in my life.Thank you Steve.
Apple is a great company to work for and do business with.  Steve worked long and hard to make Apple the best.  Thank you Steve, your innovations and hard work will live on and prosper forever.  My thoughts and prayers to the families of Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Your crations are part of my daily life...in every sense!! RIP Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
 永远的乔布斯，虽然没有使用过苹果产品，但是你的人格魅力相当令我敬佩。  愿你一路走好！
 Rest in peace, the world will miss him.
Goodbye Steve.  Heaven needs iPads, too!  Thank you for everything you have given to this mostly undeserving world.
You will truly be missed. You were a great icon to my generation and others.  Even though I never had the great opportunity to meet you, I feel as if I lost a friend. Rest in peace and my thoughts and prayers are with your family.&nbsp;
 The world lost a great visionary. Steve thank you for your beautiful legacy, and contribution to the creative spirit. You will be missed and our prayers are with your family.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for changing my life with Apple. I don’t think anyone on earth wasn’t touched by you in some way. I can’t wait to go to heaven, and see what you are doing up there....but I know it will be amazing. You will be missed, and can never EVER be replaced. My condolences to your friends and family. See you in the big iCloud in the sky. R.I.P.
Steve made a big difference in my tech life through his spirit, his vision and his creativity. I will miss him dearly along with the rest of the world, but alas, having lost loved ones myself, my heart goes out to his family, who  will miss him most of all. My sincerest condolences.
 I am Brazilian, and followed all the steps of Steve Jobs, he was a true visionary like Einstein who could see the future in an innovative and surprising, this was Steve Jobs, a genius.            
What a genius.  Steve we will miss you.  Thank you for making all of our lives easier. Our thoughts and prayers to your family, friends and colleagues. 
Mes chers amis, Mauvaise nouvelle en effet, Monsieur Steve Jobs nous a quitté ce jeudi, 6 octobre 2011 à l'âge de 56 ans. Cet inventeur de génie, ce visionnaire et ce designer d'exception nous manquera. Il aura révolutionné l'informatique, l'industrie de la Musique, le cinéma, la domotique, l'industrie des communications et bien d'autres domaines encore. Il incarnait "l'American way of life" dans toute sa splendeur et laisse donc un immense vide. Nous pensons naturellement à sa famille, à ses proches, ses collaborateurs et tous ceux qui de près ou de loin ont eu la chance de le côtoyer. Une chose est sûre, il manquera à des millions d'admirateurs de tous horizons. Rest in peace, Steve, see you upstairs.
I did not know the man personally but from what I have seen in keynotes and foundations he was truly a great man!!!!   God bless you and your family Mr. Jobs!  I hope that the world finds another like you!
We will always love and remember you, great genius! Rest In Peace!&nbsp;
If there was ever a man who served as model for me as an entrepreneur with a dream, it was Steve Jobs. Thank you Steve for being the "Apple of my life" in business and though I never knew you personally, my world will be a different place without you. May the Angels in heaven learn from your great skills of information knowledge.&nbsp;
I'm so sorry. Mr. Jobs changed my life.
 I never knew him but his ideas reached me, a normal young kid from Cape Verd, África. My country sometimes doesn't even appears in the map but steve jobs's dreams touched me, which is to never stop dreaming. Like i said i never knew him, but i believed in him, in his vision of a world where tecnology has no limits, where technology's principal goal is to simplify things, not complicate them. We lost a genius but i bet the things will never be the same in heaven, because steve jobs probably is making something new and amazing up there.  may he rest in peace. my condolences to the family, the apple company and to the world.
I will always remember using a Macintosh as my first experience with a computer.  It's the reason that I wanted to work in the Information Technology field, and get my hands on the latest technology.  Thank you for everything that you gave us, from the Pixar cartoons that my daughter watches today, all the way to bringing the  world to our fingertips.  The world will miss you, and I will miss you, may your legacy live on through your technology.  Thank you for everything. 
Tonight I asked my father to teach me to make his amazing Apple pie. I told him I was going to record it on my iPhone so that I would always remember how to make it years form now. Tonight while making memories with my dad, the genius founder, Steve Jobs, passed. This very moment I will remember for the rest of my life. Thank you Steve for standing to your values that I treasure so much! Your memory will never fade. God speed.  Love, a hardcore Mac lover!&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You are a great man with a great vision, the best CEO I've ever known.  Rest in peace. 
When a man like Steve Jobs passes away, it's easy sometimes to think  only what will become of his creations and his passions. I'd like to instead pass my condolences onto his wife and children. They  have lost a husband and a father, and it is a fate I would wish on no  one. I'll be one of millions emailing this address, but if anyone in the  Jobs family reads this, know that I and my family feel for your sorrow,  and we wish you better happier days ahead, filled with fond memories of  the best of Steve.
This news was such a shock. This was a man who changed the world. There will never be another like him.  Much love to his family at home and Apple. He lives in our hearts and memories. 
So sad to learn that Steve Jobs has passed away. His incredible technology has helped me accomplish so much in my life. He will be missed by everyone who has ever touched an Apple product.
My heartfelt condolence to Steve's family and Apple. We unquestionably, have lost one of the most inspirational leaders of our time. I just happen to be watching Steve's Stanford Commencement Speech, as I do 'very often' when my wife walked up to tell me about Steve's passing-away.  May he rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for bringing to us all a most beautiful, innovative and  exciting way of living our lives with technology. I truly hope that  Apple and your vision stay with us through out our lives and for future  generations to come. To your family may God provide you with all the  kindness, caring, support and the love of his devine Mercy so that you  may stay strong and well through these very sad times in life and  continue to live your lives to the fullest in his Blessed ways.
I am unbelievable saddened to hear the news of Steve's passing. Apple to me was family and I feel like I have lost a close friend and I never has the pleasure to meet Steve. He was a genius, an innovator and a creative visionary. RIP Steve.&nbsp;
Not only were you a the greatest visionary and innovator of our time, you inspired millions of people around the world with your beautiful mind. You've inspired me in more ways than one, and I will always look back and remember who truly inspired me to follow my intuition. My heart goes out to your family, friends, and co-workers. R.I.P
*Thank you Steve! *&nbsp;
 We just heard about Steve's Job death! We are deeply sad with the news. He was one of the biggest genius of our time! We were huge fans of him and we feel really sad that he's gone! But, the only thing we can do now is to pray for his soul and also thank for everything he has done for humanity!&nbsp;
I never met Steve Jobs but feel like I've lost a friend.  Steve and the rest of the Apple team have enriched the lives of me, my family and friends through their amazing products.  I know I speak for many who will mourn his passing and wish everyone at Apple all the best in carrying on in his memory.  Thanks for the beautiful tribute page and for giving us a chance to share.&nbsp;
 My words cannot begin to describe the way I feel.  Twelve Years  ago I was introduced to Apple via my brother giving me a G2 Macintosh. Since then I have grown to appreciate Apple products and the visionary  that was Steve Jobs.  I have followed Apple  since that day and can say  I feel as I have lost a family member,  I had never met.  My heart goes  out to his immediate and extended Apple family. He will be missed.
Being an entrepreneur I am very sadden that Mr. Jobs has passed. He was and continues to be an inspiration to me and many others. May he rest in peace!
Hello,  I have only been a user of Apple for a relatively short period of time.  In that time I have grown to appreciate the quality of Apple products  coming from passionate staff, led by those at the top. At the very top  of this passion and creativity I saw Steve Jobs. The products that have  integrated into our lives now, and that we enjoy so much are on this day  a tribute to Steve, and Steve alone.  To all Apple staff I would like to express my condolences for your loss.  I have no doubt that you will remember this visionary best by continuing  to express his passion developing the worlds best computer products.
 Your soul, now, is free to fly anywhere, anytime.  We will miss you.
I remember the first computer I used was a Mac, the 11" one.  Didn't know anything about who invented it etc, but it was magical and they still are.     Absolute Magic!!!!&nbsp;
My condolences go out to the Jobs family for their loss. I'd like to remember Mr. Jobs for the positive impact to the many different fields of which both technology &amp; design were amongst the pillars of which the Apple philosophy was built on.  Thank You for your tremendous contributions, Mr. Jobs. May you rest in peace and may your remembrance continue to inspire future generations to come.&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs!  We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your GREAT innovations, that made this digital world better and better in your presence.  We wish Apple all the very best in future! and are sure Apple will make Steve proud with continued innovations in the digital world!&nbsp;
I have enjoyed Apple products for many years.  Steve Jobs is the reason  the products are so highly regarded.  I just want to say thank you for all the good  things you did to touch our lives.  We have lost a really creative genius. Well done Steve  Jobs.  We will never forget you-or your wonderful contributions to the world. God  Bless You. 
He changed everyone's life. I will remember him forever. 
Thank you for you brilliance, Mr. Jobs. Because you dared to dream you   reached new frontiers, and we are the beneficiaries of all that you   imagined!  May his family, friends, and all those that loved Steve jobs find peace. 
 Steve Jobs will be remembered as one of the great American  visionaries of our time. His leadership, passion for excellence and  desire for innovation has changed the world beyond measure. My use of Apple computers go back to the early 1980s. As I type  this on my iMac I can't help but consider how much Steve's company has  changed the way I live life. Although Steve is no longer with us I will  remember this great man every time I use an Apple product. I thank God  for what this man's innovations and workmanship allows me to accomplish.   At this point my prayers are with his family as they go through  this time of grief. While the world lost a great leader, I sympathize  with his family, friends and employees who lost the man. May God's peace  be with you in the days and weeks ahead.&nbsp;
We will stay hungry and stay foolish.&nbsp;
I have never met Steve Jobs yet I am so deeply saddened to hear that   he has left us.  I was never an Apple "fanboy", but I've owned several   Apple products starting with an Apple //e and I'm writing this from my   iMac.  He helped create the home computer and actually changed the   world, and as an electronics geek since I could remember, he was one   of my role models.  He created a whole industry that seemed to be   tailor made just for me. He was the most amazing visionary in my   lifetime and was able to make technology simple enough for just about   anyone to use.  He followed his heart and ended up changing the world.  His impact was   far reaching and he will be missed.  I just wish I had gotten the   chance to meet him and thank him for all he's done while he was still   with us.  Good night Steve.  You've definitely earned your rest.  
Thank you Steve...... for changing the world as we know it.    ... for turning imagination into reality... ... for making mundane lives and iLife...   
 Thank you Steve for changing the world.  Grace &amp; Peace to you &amp; your  family. &nbsp;
Dear Steve,  We can't say "Good Morning" in Korea because we saw you are deceased on the way to work. This is a sad morning. It's ironic that we came to know that you've passed away through iPhone.  You've made a difference in our history, and will be remembered and respected forever in our history.  Rest in peace, Steve.&nbsp;
        Our deepest condolences to his family, friends, and co-workers. A world-wide loss, but a huge legacy left behind. We will always remember Steve Jobs, his example, and never settle for anything less than extraordinary, just like he was, an extraordinary person.  RIP, Steve
I'm 27 years old and cannot think of another death that has sat this heavy in my heart. I'm not sure why...at all...but I think that, in and of itself, shows the impact Steve had.
Thank you, Steve Jobs! We love Jobs! We love Apple!
Thank you Steve, for sharing so much of your time investing in the world around you. Our lives are forever changed because of you, and we know you hoped that change would be for the betterment of all mankind.  May it ever be so...
R.I.P. Steve Jobs; you'll still the iPapy forever and for every iDevice  owner.
Thank you for all the magic.
Thank you Steve for Pixar. Without you taking a big risk with Pixar I  would have never seen Toy Story. If I had never seen Toy Story I may  have never fallen in love with film and be at film school right now  taking a huge risk myself. I can't express what Pixar means to me and  without you, it would never have been possible. Dream big. 
You make me have big dreams and much funs to use Macintosh. I use Mac for more than 20 years.  I hope you take a rest in peace.  Thank you.&nbsp;
he is on my Mac, he is in our iPhones, he is in every iPod over the world  thanks Steve 
My Condolences to Steve's family and friends for losing such a bright light. I came to being a Macintosh fan before Steve returned to the company and I really appreciate what he's done for the company and  personal computing, but also for our imaginations about what technology can do for us. Because of Steve I've avoided many years of frustration interfacing with products designed with little care about my experience as I related to them, his vision has offered products that inspire and open up the world of possibilities, not shut it down with problems, glitches and just irritating features with a lack of human interface considerations.  As I remember Mr. Jobs today, it occurs to me that he was an aesthetician first and super human doer second. You'll be missed Steve.&nbsp;
To whoever gets this,&nbsp;We lost an inspiration of a generation and I feel one of the deepest  pains I ever had. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
His inspiration is something I live by and try to emulate, but there will only always ever be one Steve Jobs.
I offer my deepest condolences to Steve's wife, family and Apple family. May his spirit guide Apple forever.  iMourn with you.&nbsp;
From an iPhone 3GS owner, a technology person and an admirer of such a unique genius. Steve, every minute I use this phone you'll be here. The whole world has changed for good because of you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a charismatic innovative genius. The world just got a  little less awesome. Praying for the family. 
I was reading, and then logged on to facebook and saw one of my friend's post. I thought it was a cruel joke. I couldn't organize the letters into reason. I still can't believe the logic of the letters. My heart skipped a beat. I knew that he was sick, but there's always a part of you that can't resist to believe he will get better and continue changing life for all of us and for all of the people who's close to his heart. I write this with a sinking heart and weepy face and all I can think about is the speech he gave in Stanford back in 2005:  "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"  Steve, I hope your soul is now freed from all chains and suffering of the body in this world. I hope your soul is free...  Stay hungry, stay foolish. I always push towards it. 
Steve,  I'd like to say that you were a source of inspiration for me. You vouched for excellence in your work and in your colleagues. That excellence does show in the personal phone that I have. Besides the amazing work that you did, you were a great human being whose ideals spoke of a great soul.  May you rest in peace. My thoughts are with you and your family.&nbsp;
To the Friends and Family of Steve Jobs-  My deepest condolences to you all in your time of remembrance.  I have been an Apple Retail employee for 8 years and I feel deep sorrow at our loss today.  Steve was not only the head of Apple, he was the heart that kept it's blood flowing and the soul that kept it unique.  Apple will forever embody the spirit of Steve and his essence will continue to guide all that we do at Apple.  Strange will be the days ahead at my store and in the Apple arch worldwide without our keystone.  As I'm sure he would've wanted, we will continue on with his spirit flowing through all that we do; we will continue to innovate and thrive at all levels and never forget how it all began.&nbsp;
There is not much to say aside thank you  In 1984 I was 13 years old, Steve started to inspire me back then, he never stopped  Thank you for your inspiration  Thank you for your creativity  Thank you for your vision  Thank you for the way you changed our world  Your dream of making a difference for humanity will be remembered Respectfully
Dear Steve,  I have no word to say how i'm sad...so....thank you...rest in peace.
We lost another genius that will never be forgotten. RIP Steve
My great inspirer. Wish you have rest in another wonderful world.
  Sent from my iPad.  That's all. It's your creation. 
Dear Amazing and Genius Guy &nbsp; R.I.P.
I'm tearing up as I write this as the world lost a remarkable visionary.  I've never written before but I'm compelled to write to express my deepest sorrow.  My heart goes out to his family and all extended family at Apple and his fans.  May his soul rest in peace.
I would like to extend my sincere apologies to the Jobs family and to  Apple Inc. for their loss. Mr. Jobs helped to truly revolutionize the  industry and brought about many great innovations. He will be sorely  missed.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  Good bye...  We could be happier because of you, Steve.  Good bye again.  Thanks and warm regards.
Rest in Peace Mr. Steve Jobs and Thanks for everything!!  :'(                 
Dear Steve,  You are the global leader of our times. Thank you for showing me that by listening to my heart and being committed to my dreams, I can be more than I ever imagine. &nbsp;
To the Jobs and Apple Family, my condolences on hearing of the passing of Steve Jobs.  His brilliance, contributions and innovations will live on and has changed lives around the world.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
My heart goes out to his family and friends - the world has lost a brilliant  and revolutionary thinker.  And  although he is permanently etched in history, he will sorely be missed!  May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Still got the SE 30. When I bought it my friend said I wouldn't need another  computer for a long time. He was right.
The world should be divided as follows: Before Steve Jobs and after Steve Jobs. From today we are at the after.&nbsp;
My condolences and prayers go out to Steve's family, his friends and   coworkers. In the years ahead, I hope and believe Apple will hold on   to the high standard of excellence and vision Steve so passionately   nurtured into this company. The genius of Steve was not the devices   and company he so brilliantly pioneered, but his ability to dream of   something better, to always improve it and never give up.  
Dear Apple Community,    I like to share with you my deep regrets for the lost of an OUT STANDING  human being.  The kind of leadership, creative qualities, exceptional vision and  understanding of the consumer, indeed a very unique leader made of our  dear Steve Jobs a source of inspiration for people all over the world.  Steve Jobs touched millions through his work and out standing qualities,  I can't barely imagine how the people next to him may feel for this  lost.    May God hold close our dear Steve Jobs for all the good he made being a  wonderful source of inspiration for many many people. My Best to you!    
 Steve,  You inspired us all and you will be remembered and missed worldwide. Prayers to your family and friends.&nbsp;
It reminds me of how true it is that only the good die young.  What a remarkable person and tremendous void that is left in the world.
My condolences to the world. Steve Jobs was proof positive of the  strength, determination and indomitable spirit of the visionary. Proof  also, in the ability of an individual to transcend the limitations of  convention. Hard work, ingenuity and faith has been the hallmark of  America and was personified in Steve. He was among my heroes and I am  devastated by the loss.
Thank you Steve for your vision and passion; your vision and the years of dedication for all of your tools you gave us to succeed.   Fair Winds and Following Seas………
 Steve Jobs, a genius, a man who is history, a man who inspires thousands of people, including me. Is an admirable person. All his creations, all his mind, his thoughts. There are no words to describe such a wonderful man.  R.I.P Steve Jobs            
Thank you, Mr. Jobs, for changing the world.&nbsp;
 I am so sad; every single day I use products made and inspired by Steve Jobs . I've had an iPod for a third of my life (since I was 20, I'm now 30!). When I joined high school at 11, I learnt how to work on an apple computer which was just a little bit bigger than the lovely iPad 2 that I've had for the last two weeks :-) and of course for the last 2.5 years I've used my iPhone everyday.  I wish I thought like Steve, he was a revolutionary, visionary, and an inspiration to never stop dreaming and challenging what we see around us.  Thank you for everything you've brought to us.&nbsp;
Dear family &amp; friends.. today we lost a visionary, an important human being, Steve Jobs! But we shouldn't be sad! He left memories behind, and without him we wouldn't be the generation we are today! His family and friends are in our prayers! 
Today is a sad day but steve has build a legacy that will grow and carry his  dream forward for years to come. Rest I Peace Steve you made the world a better place :-)
The world has lost one of the most creative and inspirational people ever. You will be missed.
Many people will say Steve Jobs was a great man who changed the industry. I would like to say something of more meaning. Steve Jobs was a great man and an incredible leader who never gave up even in time where it looked like Apple was going nowhere. Steve will always live in the hearts of people all across the world, and I know I will never forget the kind of humble man he was.
You left your mark on our desks, on our ears, in our hands &amp; in our life. RIP Steve. Stay hungry, stay foolish!!   
THANK YOU STEVE. YOU CHANGED THE WORLD FOR THE BEST.&nbsp;
My mom called me tonight to let me know of Steve's passing, My eyes filled up I adored Steve he was driven person. I love everything about Apple. I feel as if I lost my dear friend. I did not know Steve, but Steve knew what people wanted. Steve. I'm overcome with sadness. God bless you Steve you have done so much good a special place is saved for you in heaven.
My parents thank you, I thank you, my children thank you and their  children will thank you for revolutionizing the way we live and work. RIP.
Although I never had to pleasure to meet Mr. Jobs, I really wish I could have. I wish I had the opportunity to meet the man who had passion and foresight to build two empires in Apple and Pixar. Even though he worked hard his en tire life, I'm sure he loved every minute of it. Rest in peace Steve Jobs you will surely be missed.
In spite of we are the same age, he was the most admiring man in my life, after 1985. My condolences to his family, to Apple family, to me.
Steve Jobs, you were such an inspiration, I can't believe it, the world will  MISS YOU. Thanks for all the Awesome technology you created. APPLE for ever ! "Rest in Peace"
  Everyone will miss Steve's visionary leadership and business sense. He  has brought America back to the forefront of the business world. Thanks  Steve for all you did to make America feel good about itself again. Our  thoughts and prayers are with his family and all those who were close to  him.
I just want you to say: Thanks for your legacy and your effort!  I wish you to have a nice trip, and be the light with you.&nbsp;
I can only add my gratitude for what Steve Jobs accomplished. My family  and I started with Apple computers and, whenever we had to work on PCs,  have praised his mandate to make computers user friendly.  Yes, he will be missed. And, more importantly, he is honored. I can only  hope that Apple will continue his extraordinary vision and creativity.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an inspiration to me. He represented everything you could  accomplish in life if you believed in yourself, and loved what you did  with all your heart. I can not even begin to express the impact his  creation, the iPod, has had in my life. The music of my childhood was  available at any time inside my pocket.  At the worst times in my life,  I always had music to keep me company, to keep me sane, thanks to Steve  Jobs. He revolutionized the world. And the way I go about my life. I  follow Apple as a fiercely loyal customer in no small part due to his  charisma and wonderful personality. Thank you Steve for what you have  done. Thank you for your life. A life that has impacted millions around  the world.&nbsp;
I just want to say, Steve Jobs was one of the best people I have ever known. Rest in Peace Steve.&nbsp;
I would like to offer my condolences to the Jobs and Apple families for the loss of Steve Jobs.     He was a visionary and advanced the use of technology in our lives. I greatly respected his humility and desire to keep his family and personal life private.&nbsp;
Thanks to Steve Jobs today we have macs, laptops, iPads, iPods, and iPhones, the way he build this industry was very creative. My thought   of this amazing company is every body wants mac which is Apple. Let us   pray, dear steve thank you for all the technology you have given us   today and for many years we will let  you R.I.P rest in peace! In the   name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit Amen sent from a mac... 10 yrs old! ;( rest in peace thank you for all   of your hard work. 
The world lost a truly brilliant visionary. Steve was always on the  cutting edge, knew what the public wanted and made it cool to want Apple  products. He will be missed. R.I.P. Steve. 
May god bless you and give you eternal peace, and may the people who loved you be strong enough to carry on against the sadness and live remembering how precious you are for them,for all of us. One of the largest apple family on earth. Peace be with you
Not often am I affected so profoundly by the the death of someone outside my  family.  The world has lost an extraordinary human being. May God bless his soul and give comfort to his family.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was my inspiration to go to technology when he presented iPhone ever he was like a my mentor to me even though he never know me but I just want his family to know this. So I send my condolences to the family and GOD bless
 Thank You so much STEVE JOBS for the legacy you left behind, thank you to give us the oportunitty to have a computer in front of us, thank you for giving us the iPod, iPhone, iPad, but I want to say THANK YOU to you because you are my life inspiration and my model of life to follow, im a programmer and I will miss you.  RIP STEVE JOBS! THANK YOU
 There are some people who are instrumental in creating something so special, intangible, yet tangible...someTHING that leaves you amazed, awe-struck. I am one of millions of people around the world, perhaps billions, who is truly saddened to hear of this enormous loss. Many of us never knew him. However, we still empathize and even share your grief for a young life lost. I want to extend heartfelt condolences to the family, friends, colleagues of Steve Jobs. You will feel the pain of this loss in the coming days, months, years. However, I hope you find comfort in your memories of him.
What an incredible loss... I am so proud to remember a very small amount of work I did with Steve while in my first two jobs in Silicon Valley. One thing in particular - in a room with about a dozen people, I stood not 3 feet from him as he wrote a 'personal' check to purchase Pixar from LucasFilm/George Lucas. His pen faltered as he was writing the amount and he looked up with a boyish grin and made a comment about never writing a check that big before. His extraordinary vision will be missed by anyone who has ever picked up an Apple product and simply thought, "Yes!" Thank you Steve.
  I did not know Mr. Jobs but he touched my life with the products from Apple. His battle is over and he can rest in the Lord.     I am sure God is saying well done my faithful servant.&nbsp;
The future is shining. 
As you nicely said, "We lost a great man". I say goodbye Dear Steve, nice Steve, peace be upon your brilliant soul, with my eyes full of tear and sorrow.
I just read the sad news about Steve's dead. &nbsp;A few days ago, I saw a video with his speech at Standford university... and he really inspired me to really believe in myself and also to believe that nothing is impossible if you really try. I send my condolences to his family and to Apple family too.  He will live forever, his legacy will never be forget because he has inspired us to give the best we can, not only in what we do ... in hole life. Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;
I don't often get shaken up by the death of someone famous that I've  never met before.  But yet, tonight, as I read the news on Apple.com of the death of Steve  Jobs, I found tears falling on the aluminum unibody of my MacBook Pro. Steve Jobs was an inspiration for me. Since as long as I can remember,  the story of Steve Jobs has inspired me in my daily life. It's inspired  me in everything from dating my girlfriend, to choosing my major in  college. Steve told people to make sure they love what they do and who  they're with. I do.  Steve was one of my heroes, my inspirations and my idols. I don't know  quite what else to say other than that I will miss this man. I only wish  I had the opportunity to meet him and tell him how much he has changed  my life.  Rest in Peace, friend. Let's hope you got where you were going and that  you know how many lives you've changed. Thank you.
To the Jobs Family and all of Apple,&nbsp;I am very sorry for your loss. The world&nbsp;is definitely a better place for all that&nbsp;Mr. Jobs&nbsp;brought to realization, not only for Apple but all of the industries that he was a part of and the other companies&nbsp;that he&nbsp;pushed to be better than ordinary.&nbsp;
I would like to express my condolences.  I never knew him personally.  I knew the products.  His vision helped me through my teaching career and military career.  The products still help me.  There is a great loss in this world.  There are a lot of people have no real clue of the loss.  He made Apple and there are a lot of people who don't understand how much he helped to progress our world.  We now stand closer to the the sci-movies more than ever before.  It may not sound like much but the realization to bringing technology that is supposed to be hundreds of years away now is unmeasurable.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly we have lost a pal, a visionary who changed the ways of our lives.   It's rightly said, "good things don't last long" and he was the best.  Adios amigo, may your soul rest in peace and may God give courage and strength to your loved ones to bear this untimely loss.
 I feel deep sorrow and I express my condolences to his family in particular,  and to all Apple people.  I would really have enjoyed to work with him at Apple, and I am sure the team at Apple, who has been sharing and enriching his visions, will outstand in  continuing on the ways he opened with his great passion and intelligence.&nbsp;
The wold lost the BIGGEST innovator of our time. RIP, Steve. While I didn't know you personally, I can say that you affected my life in a very positive way. One thing is for sure…your brilliance will cause the stars to shine a little brighter from now on.
It's hard to believe that such a young person leaves us this way. But I can say that you, Steve, wherever you are, will be always here in every single product and in every single thing that remember us of your capacity to create the best.  In memory of my first idol. You changed the world in a way that only you can do. 
Thank you Steve, you really made this world better.
You created something beautifull!  The world will remember you! 
Thank you Steve, I am almost in tears as I write this. Your passion and love for your work is an inspiration to us all. You have touched our lives and changed us for the better, making us more knowledgeable, accessible and more connected than ever. There are few people in the world who not only shape the industries in which they operate, but shape the lives and feelings of the people who are connected to them. You accomplished such a task in your lifetime and I, a 24 year-old, thank you.   We love you Steve, you will be immeasurably missed by all of us and by us, I mean the people who have been intrigued, shocked and amazed by all you have had to teach us and show us. Thank you.&nbsp;
I was lucky enough to see Steve deliver a keynote at Mac World many years ago.    He is the Henry Ford of our time.  There is no question about it.  I hold solace in the fact that every Tweet and post on Facebook for the last hour has been about Steve.  He touched us all and will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
To start my sincere condolences to Apple and to the rest of the World for the great loss, our dear Steve Jobs who brought us so so much at a technological level and in so many other ways! I've always been a fan of Steve I really liked his way to see everything around him...Also my condolences to his family!
Not only did you create a powerhouse industry but you did it with those individuals who are too often forgotten in mind (individuals with special needs, elderly people, etc.).  An extreme quiet has filled my room since hearing the news...peace and release and do not let those heading the company to silence those individuals who are often forgotten.  Rest In Peace and Sending my gentle hand to help guide your family through these difficult times. 
Hi I just like to say he looked like a great person ,and his invention will be remembered in the past, present and future ,and I hope people follow his ideas, today a great genius departed  
Regardless of whether a person considers themselves a "Mac" or a "PC," Steve Jobs played a huge role in bringing computer technology into the our homes, and for that we are all in his debt. He was a constant visionary, to the point where it seemed as though he could truly see into the future. 
Steve Jobs was a true hero of the technology world. From his parents backyard to Apple Inc, he is the co-creator of so many innovative products like the  iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac etc... Today the world has lost a very inspiring man, rest in peace Steve.
RIP to a man that changed the world of technology forever. He won't be forgotten.
I have to say, I believe the death of Mr. Jobs will affect us all. He  was such a simple, yet savvy man; whether for running a company to  succeeding in business, Jobs has truly accomplished things in his 56  years that most others wouldn't have dreamed of. My prayers are with him  and his family.
    Steve's brilliance, passion and energy were the source of countless innovations that enrich and improve all of our lives. The world is immeasurably better because of him.
Steve certainly changed my life... Me and my best friend FaceTime everyday and he's across the country&nbsp;
  Steve Jobs inspired me, my husband and our children to be more than average. Apple products are woven into each of our lives. We offer&nbsp;condolences&nbsp;and&nbsp;solace&nbsp;to his family. Thanks Steve for everything!
Because of Steve, I think different.   
Um cara magnificante, batalhador, vencedor da vida, e em sua carreira profissional, brilhante, lutou pela sua conquista até o fim de sua vida, que Deus acolha sua alma, um cara que foi simples, humilde, que descanse em paz. A Família, Amigos de trabalho despesa-me, força, fé, pois a vida continua para aqueles que ficam aqui na terra. Um forte abraço e grande carinho!!&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for pushing the envelope of innovation and changing the  course of history. You were an inspiration to me. You changed the world.  Now its time for you to relax. We'll keep pushing the envelope and  hopefully live up to the standards you set.&nbsp;  Rest well my friend.
Clearly a giant among innovators whose visionary work has indelibly  benefitted humanity.
Steve really inspired me to go into the IT field, and really taught me a  lot about Technology. I'm currently 16 and Steve has inspired me to go  to college. He taught me that it takes the hardware and software must  work together, along with several other things. I'll always miss Steve  and keep him in my thoughts.
My thoughts prayers and best intentions are with Steve's family and friends ...  Thank you Steve for making my life more organized, efficient and productive... but mostly thank you for making it a little more fun ;-)&nbsp;
by staying foolish, staying hungry you changed the world. You inspire us to think big and think different. Steve Jobs, we will remember
Hi Apple,  Steve Jobs is an amazing person, who has truly changed the world. He had went beyond his goals that he set for himself. He will be missed and will not be forgotten by me, an Apple Fan Boy&nbsp;
There will never be an innovator or visionary like Steve Jobs. His spirit and passion for excellence is what made Apple what it is today.
Farewell dear Steve, you thought me to show my ideas to the world  without fear, and I'm only 17. I hope you're in a better place, as I  know you probably will be since you've facilitated people's lives. We've  lost a great mind and innovator. Rest in peace Steve Jobs, I'll miss  you.
  4 apples that has changed the human history: Eva's, Isaac's, The Beatles's and Steve's.
I can only say that I am deeply sadden by Mr. Jobs passing.  I thank him for his vision and all that he has done in creating APPLE and all of their products. I pray that you all at APPLE and Mr. Jobs family are comforted in all of the great memories of him.  My condolences and deepest sympathies.&nbsp;
I am simply one of the many millions of people touched by Steve Jobs'  influence across the world. It is truly a sad day to learn that such an  individual has passed away. I will forever remember him as I continue to  use the products he birthed. Here's to you Steve.
WOW, there has been a disturbance in "The Force"!!  What a shocking, unfortunate, untimely loss for Apple and all that Steve brought to Apple and the world through innovation, products, design and beliefs.  He will be sadly missed, and I never even met him, although I wish I could have.&nbsp;
I can't believe the news… I just saw him on TV this morning! He was such a brilliant individual. I started using Macs back in 1994 and never looked back since. I loved his vision and was happy and proud when he would announce a new item to the Apple family. Rest in peace Steve. You will be greatly missed.
:'(  Nothing else to say... but Thank you.&nbsp;
An extraordinary force in the universe is gone--he was an inspiration  and a treasure.  Safe journey. 
 "Mis hijos crecerán con mac"....fue una frase que dije a mis 18 años en alguna clase y que el maestro utilizó para ejemplificar la fidelidad a una marca. Yo creo que más que a una marca ha sido a una revolución...a una compañía que gracias a su líder ha optado por humanizar la tecnología, por convertir en un acompañante lo que antes era una herramienta, por volverla verdaderamente util e innovadora.  Gracias Steve por llenarnos con tu creatividad y enseñarnos que vivir y trabajar con esa pasión de verdad nos puede hacer cambiar al mundo.&nbsp;
HE IS A GOOD MAN, WHO GIVE HIS GREAT HEART AND GIFTS TO THE WHOLE WORLD...  GOD BLESS YOU, STEVE！ WE LOVE YOU FOREVER...&nbsp;
  This drawing is a gift for Steve today.  I am so sad to hear of his passing... he has truly left his mark on the world in more ways than one. Not only did he aid in the creation of 3D animation, he brought us the tools needed to perfect it . His devotion and passion will forever be admired and appreciated.  Thank you for bringing beauty into this world, Steve.
...thank you for all you've given us. I will remember your journey and  feel privileged to have shared this time on earth with you. Namaste.
"Three Apples that changed the world. One seduced Eve, second awakened Newton, the third one was in the hands of Steve Jobs."  I loved this quote about the three apples so decided to interpret it into a poster as a tribute to Steve Jobs. (see attached)  Steve Jobs was a genius and one of my idols who was taken from the world too soon and wanted to share this poster with you that I created.   RIP Steve.&nbsp;
I pray his soul may rest in peace.
He did everything he could to make the world a better place. I know he made mine better with his efforts. Thanks, Mr. Jobs.
Steve:  Thanks for your thoughts and your empower, thanks for your vision and your ideal. Thanks God for you! You have been many of us inspiration.  God bless your family to gain peace and hope quite soon.  God bless you too.&nbsp;
I thank you for what you did. I thank you for your imagination and your believes. I am personally proud of you.  Rest in peace.
Even though I've spent the majority of my career working in technology stacks other than yours, I can truly appreciate the vision it takes to lead a company to create such wonder products. I think we've lost a real world leader today.&nbsp;
Thanks for bring your amazing ideas and give to us the fortune know you, thanks for making us laugh and making our work easier with all you products...
Thank you dear friend, you will be missed.&nbsp;
Dear wonderful Steve,  You did really really change the world. Billions of us are eternally thankful to you and your team.  We are very much the poorer for your passing but we will honour your vision and courage for centuries to come.  So sorry.&nbsp;
Our thoughts and prayers are withe the Jobs family and the friends and extended family at Apple. 
I don't know if this little note will ever be read, and I am not sure even why I am sending it, as I never met Steve, nor indeed anyone who works at Apple. I just want to express my hopes for tomorrow on a very sad day.  The most salient mark of Mr. Jobs' greatness is the Idea of Apple itself. That Idea comprises all the incredible people there who every day strive to not just do good business, but to do good in the world by making technology infinitely more humane than it might otherwise be. Without that intense commitment to our shared humanity, Apple would just be another company.   The future of what it is to be human is now intimately and inextricably tied to our technology, and with your continued dedication to what it is to be Apple, and your example to others, that future remains shining bright.  We have Steve to thank for the vision, and Apple itself to thank for the realization.  Thank you.
A great man is gone!!!!!! 
Steve,   I used your imagination to create awareness on environment conservation, and care a bit more for our planet. I hope many more people can dream of a better world as you did.  May the condor guide you on this passage to the new life.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs a man that change the world with his AMAZING ideas in  technology, I will never forget him and I really thank him for making  the best products of the world staring with iMac to MacBook to the iPods  and iPhones. God bless his family and he. Even do he is out of earth his  inventions and his company are still here. For me Steve Jobs will never  die. The most amazing genius of the world is now resting in peace.  Thanks for all, I will never forget you!
Thank you for changing the world of technology.  I am your number 1 fan!!! I will always be a forever supporter of apple.  Thank you.   Rest in Peace, Sir.
     Steve Jobs was so much more than a great person, a legendary figure in our technological society; many years from now, I do believe that people will still speak of the iPod and iPhone and iPad, and how the company that created them, and how the man behind that company was a forward-thinking leader of a computing revolution and how his company's products changed so many aspects of so many people's lives. As another young, forward-thinking human being, who has spent his time in his own garage working on his own ideas, I can proudly say that Mr. Jobs has inspired me to follow in his footsteps and someday, make even half the difference which he has made on society. Nobody has or ever will ever create an MP3 player so popular, a cell phone so ubiquitous, or a tablet so perfect as Steve Jobs. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
         I'll miss you Steve.......  
Steve was a wonderful leader and innovator.  I believe he led a very  good life and never fell for the celebrity life style.  Very sad about his passing.  The country really needs him.  God's speed, rest in peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Master genius!  You will live on through your incredible products and humbleness.  You've left an extraordinary legacy!  May God greet you at the open gates with open arms and may beautiful memories comfort your family, peers and fans!&nbsp;
I just would like to say that after seeing how many products Apple has made revolutionary, Steve really is the root of it all.  Without him, the world would be an entirely different place.  I was watching the introduction of the original iPhone on youtube the other day and was just blown away at the magnificence of the phone at the time.  There was nothing else like it.  Now, everyone else strives to be like it.  I am an Apple supporter and will be for the rest of my time.  I love your products and they wouldn't be what they are today without the inflection from Steve.  I just wish I could tell him thanks.  He will be missed greatly.  My thoughts and prayers are with his friends and family.&nbsp;
Thank you Mr. Jobs for too many things to even try to type in an email. You have changed my life in ways that I never thought would be possible and I am better person because of you. How strange to feel the truth of that fact when I never came close to meeting you in person. You are an inspiration in the fullest sense of the word and you will be sorely missed. May you now find comfort in the iClouds above. Rest in peace sir
Steve,   You and your turtleneck will be missed.  Thanks for being a great human being.
It is sad to find out that one of our great leaders in technology has passed away. i send my condolences to all friends and family of Mr Jobs. rest in peace Steve, your inspiring image of how to change the world will keep moving on. RIP Steve. you will be missed. 
I just wanted to send my prayers for the family and friends of Steve jobs he will be missed greatly. Tonight is a sad night for everyone that loves apple. Steve jobs will never be forgotten. His vision will live on in the company he built. I'm sorry.
I've been a Mac owner since 1989, and an Apple admirer since well before that. What Steve Jobs did was great not only for his vision, but for his ability to bring the best out in people, both as customers and the large number of employees that have worked at Jobs-led companies over the decades. He will be missed.
iMan iHuman iGenius iInventor iLove iMiss iThank iRemember 
Remembering your fantastic ambition and thoughts, stay hungry, stay foolish! To wish god with you!
Thank you Steve for all you are and the paths you helped pave with your presence and passion. Many blessings to him and all those whose hearts he touched and illuminated.&nbsp;
My condolences to Mr. Jobs. The best of luck Mr. Cook. Apple will always be special to me and I have no doubt they will continue to be successful.
 My condolences to Steve Jobs friends and family. Steve was a genius, given his time here he succeeded in changing the world in his own way and also to inspire people in the process. We need people like him, visionaries that do not fear being pioneers and leaders, carving a path for others to follow, making this world a better place. Even though his team at apple did a great job at presenting the latest additions and updates at the last apple event, he was quite the presenter.  He will be missed.                   
Ever since I was young, my family didn't even know what Apple really  was. They just considered it to be a regular computer company. Apple is  more than that, and I showed them exactly that. When I was 11 years old,  I convinced my Mom to buy a MacBook Pro for herself. I spent 2 years  trying to convince her. Now I am 14, and my entire family together owns  5 iPod Touches, 2 iPhones, 1 iPad, and 2 macs. Steve Jobs was such a hero for me, it was because of him that I want to  be a computer designer when I grow up.&nbsp;
To the family and friends of Steve, my thoughts and prayers are with you.  Steve shaped a generation and will be greatly missed and remembered forever.&nbsp;
I just found out about you, and I'm in absolute shock. I just wanted to let you know how much you changed my life, my super mega ultra simple life. And that I love you. For the great guy you were and will always be. Thank you for all, and be in peace. With much love, gratitude, admiration, respect, and all the good you certainly deserve.&nbsp;
 We will miss you. You have always inspired me.  Sent from my iPod and from my heart.
The legacy you left behind will never be forgotten.
Here in Brazil....we are so sad...The world lost a great person and a beautiful human been... I hope that Steve rest in peace..... Tomorrow will be another day...a worst day in the world... 
He was a very special person. We will all miss him. May his soul rest in  peace. So far, thank you. 
I remember waking up as a child and going onto my uncles Macintosh II. I played Oregon trail, Number Munchers, Where in the world is Carmen San Diego and many other games. Apple was the best thing to me back then and it has changed a lot since then. I just want to thank you, Steve and your family (Apple included) for everything you've done so far. You are an amazing genius. It's been fun and I'm glad, I was able to join you on that ride as a consumer. I'll be praying for you and your family that today is not a day of sorrow but a day of joy. A day we can look back and say, "Remember, Steve Jobs? Yep, he was amazing, I can't sum up words to how creative that guy is or was." Thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
Very Sad news. He was an icon. Condolences to his family and coworkers.
The world will remember your name 'till the end of time.&nbsp;
The king of apple by far the most creative well skilled and level spirited person. Without him what would we have, microsoft? Thanks for bringing us the  future steve jobs.
May you rest in peace.You and your Apples accompany me for such a happy  time in life. Thanks
Dear Steve, All though I never met you I wanted to say Thank you for making me a better person! And opening my mind to Creativity. May God Hold you and your Family.
  I have never  trusted nor been more profoundly inspired inspired  and effected by a man I have never met. I remember my first Apple product experience to be thought provoking and  absolutely wonderful. Mr. Jobs has made my life easier in so many ways that I can hardly begin  to count them. My hope is that Steve's genius and vision continues the way he hoped it  would. I cannot thank him enough for the way he has touched my life. His vision and products continue to  motivate me and engender my creativity daily. Thank you Steve.
My name is Daniel and I'm nine I own the iPad 2 and Steve was a great man.
Steve Job was one of the most incredible individuals who ever lived on this earth. He has changed the world with his creative ideas and will be a source of inspiration for years to come. He's given us the Macbook, iPod, iPhone,and iPad and so much more. I want to thank Steve Jobs for being one of the inspirations in my life. I was I could have met him but I know he's in a better place. Thank you Steve Jobs you will be missed.
I've lost my inspiration today:( 
If you say this is your retirement plan, I am glad that you finally achieve it. You work too hard, it is sad but you deserve it. Thank you Steve.
Thnak you Steve. You have completely changed my life.&nbsp;
I never knew this man.  I never met this man.  But he affected my life.  His vision in bringing computers into the homes of Americans reached me at a young age and developed a love and understanding of the machine that thrives to this day.  Something about this man inspires.  And everything about this man will live on through the way he has changed our lives and our livelihood.  From my first computer experiences playing Oregon Trail on 5-1/2" floppy disks to my beloved iPhone that I refuse to share with my children, I will always remember the man who allowed us to live his dream.     To his friends and family, those closest to him, may you find the comfort you need and rest assured that he will not soon be forgotten.  To those of you who were inspired by him, may you continue to strive for the greatness he personified.   
Stay hungry. Stay foolish.  Rest in Peace. 
Thank you Steve.  You have inspired me. Because of you I'm a better person.  Rest in peace and in happiness.&nbsp;
We have lost one of this worlds greatest. May you rest in peace Steve. The world is better because of your vision. May we always remember your efforts. Thanks a lot for all that you have done.
I am so sorry to hear the news of Steve Jobs' passing.  His insight, vision and drive were a rare combination and will be missed.  Our condolences to Mr. Jobs and his family! 
Just Thanks. 
Although I didn't know Steve personally, he was quite a popular name in  my household!  He will certainly be missed and remembered by all who  knew and loved him, and also by all Apple owners in the world. I watched  the presentation of Lion and I was immediately taken in by his  incredible spirit!  He was truly a unique individual!  God Bless You  Steve! 
What to say?  Only the good die young!  A sad night!
I'm sure that millions of people all over the world feel the sadness that I feel. The world lost an icon today. From a very young age, I have been fascinated with the computer and the vision behind it. More than a machine, an emulation of the human intellect. Just as Steve Jobs was more than a man (though he would argue that point I'm sure) a true visionary, one who magically translated the most complex technologies into a language that we could all understand. Steve Jobs will always be an icon. A leader in vision and a mentor who has and will continue to inspire millions of young techies to revitalize technological development and continue to bring amazing new technology to the world.      Thank you for having the courage to share your vision, you have touched us all. You will be missed.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve Jobs. And thank you. Thank you for inspiring me to chase after my dreams with your Stanford  commencement speech. Thank you for enabling me to express myself through the products you  created. Thank you for putting technology in the hands of my 75 year old  Nana with the original iPad. Thank you for giving my father the ability  to create home videos with the iMac. i Thank You.
 A great man has gone away to rest in peace, but the good thing... is that his suffering has gone, it is now ours... There are no words that can relieve our pain. It hurs so bad to me, and i can imagine that also hurts to all his fans, and all the people that worked with him... that we lost someone so wonderful, smart, with a great wisdom just like Steve.To me, he'll always be one of the most important persons that helped humanity, I'll always remember him.            
Something about Steve Jobs’ death touches me and I’m truly sadden by his death.  Maybe because Steve represented cool in a geeky way and from my vantage point he seemed so alive and inventive.  At 56 years old it seems so unfair to suffer and die of a debilitating illness.  I’m just so sorry for Steve, and everyone who loves him.  May Steve Jobs rest in peace. 
Congratulations on reinventing the way we communicate, and show how much things are more minimalist, more will be fine. Young people that read his story will be inspired. 
While expected, still a shock. He changed how we interact with the world. He moved us into using a personal computer. The design, the simplicity, the completeness of the product and the packaging, brilliant. Ironic that so many of us learned of the sad news on a product that Steve gave us. God speed&nbsp;
I would like to thank Steve Jobs for having inspired me to follow my  dreams and achieve great things.
I would just like to say that we have lost such an amazing person. He changes the world. Now he is up in the  iCloud. Even though I am only 14, he has been my inspiration for as long as I can remember. He took a chance, and wow,  look where that got him. Someday i want to work at Apple. He is and always be my role model.
Never knew you but admired Apple. Maybe, I did know you. Sleep now, sleep.&nbsp;
Feels weird writing something about someone i didn't know but it   feels right to express how much i value &amp; respect the work he did   with apple. my macpro computer, and the imac &amp; ibook before it, are   phenomenal tools. And&nbsp;<div>my life is much the better for them. Apple is a   business, so my happiness with my computer is money in the bank for   them. But it's money i've happily spent b/c the innovation &amp; the user   friendly approach is wonderful. PCs seem so retro, and not in a good   way, compared&nbsp;</div><div>to&nbsp;a Mac. Then there's itunes, ipod, ipad, iphone...   He'll be remembered &amp; revered&nbsp;</div><div>far into the future as the father of   modern computer technology. My condolences to his family, friends,   colleagues and associates.&nbsp;</div>
Thanks Steve !!! You lead us to future, inspiration and fun. Your company, we; your customers and the entire world will keep you in our memories for ever. RIP&nbsp;
(Don't&nbsp;know why I'm feeling like this, but I'm feeling this. Now that I can never meet him in my life, I feel like I'm way to behind to achieve any of my goals.) I heard of Steve Jobs when I first heard of computers. The days when I was an avid teenager going through computer mags unlike most other kids of that age ( I'm from Bangladesh and back in 1995-200, computer was that much of a "New Thing" here), I saw his comeback to Apple and saw him turning one "OLD MAN" into one "COOL DUDE". An inventor, a creator, a successful&nbsp;marketeer, The world has so much to learn from him. My deepest sympathy for his family, friends and fans. One "Steve Jobs" happened to the world, changing its course forever. He was an event himself, making the most personal the computer ever can be, giving it to the mass.&nbsp; We will Remember you, Steve.... You are the center column of the Pantheon of technology... And you will always be... &nbsp;&nbsp;
 If there is one man that could organize everything for you, it was Steve Jobs. At the touch of a finger, life was/is made easy with his genuis electronics and devices. Steve Jobs was a genuine man in all aspects. I'm not so sure  our future would have have looked so bright without his innovative and creative mind. He was a leader and mentor that will forever be remembered. &nbsp;I'll think of him while I pull out my iPad, spend hours on my Mac laptop and send thousands of texts and business information on my iPhone. &nbsp;Mr. Jobs is everywhere. He is still with us. In every device, we use in his honor. &nbsp;May Steve Jobs rest in peace and be free from suffering.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,  I have owned every Apple product since 1984.  Every product has delivered a revolutionary inspiration to young, and old, like myself to aspire to something better in the technology people like myself may have an opportunity to develop.  Steve Jobs, and his company Apple, have been and always will represent the best that engineering has to offer society.  I am sorry to say I never has the opportunity to work at Apple or meet Steve Jobs, but still he has been a household name most of my life.  I offer my foundest thoughts and prayers to Steve Jobs, and his family.
What an amazing person; his genius and creativity will live on forever. He has made this world a better place; we have been blessed to have him in our lives.&nbsp;
 No words will never give me chance to express my sadness for Steve , also no words can give him the honor he deserve the man is a Legend, He really changed the face of the earth.            
A great man has passed away. We should remember Steve now and forever for what he's achieved: A better world with beautiful and useful devices.
I remember a time when I didn't have money and I couldn't afford a iphone. It is silly but, I always counted on Mr. Jobs to raise the bar so that my meager pay could offord a phone with better feature so that I can conduct business. Thanks for raising the bar. 
Somehow the death of someone so far away made today so gloomy. Goodbye Steve Jobs. It's now time to meet your genius creator.
Steve, you were one of the greats. A true visionary.  Words cannot  express how much I have enjoyed your products.    Farewell and we pray  that a next Steve Job appears in our lifetime.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs not only made Operating Systems for any human, he invented the most inspiring way of computing!
 I am very sorry to hear of Steve Jobs' passing. My first  computer was a 1984 Mac. I got through college with my Mac SE. More  recently I am a proud owner of a MacBook Pro and an iPhone 4. Steve's  vision and creativity will be missed. My condolences to his family and all of Apple.&nbsp;
 I'm so sadden to here of the loss of Steve from the other side of the globe in Australia. Although I wasn't even born at the time Steve even created Apple I feel so much a part of his vision. As a college student theres no better mentor I could think of then Steve. As cheesy as it sounds whenever their was a press conference held to launch a new iPhone or iPad I felt that no matter what else was going on in the world, no matter how many wars and global financial crises present, there would always be people like Steve who with perseverance and unique creative genius could bring the world together with something as brilliant and practical as communication technology most people know today as Apple! Thank You Steve for giving us the privilege to experience this world with your genius creations. You will be sadly missed.            
Mr. Jobs, you were definitely a crazy one. Here's to the craziest one of  all. Thank you for revolutionizing the world, and bringing the personal  computer to the public, and for starting the trend of starting  everything with a lowercase "i". You will be missed, Mr. Apple. &nbsp;
My condolences! Steve Jobs found a company so big and beautiful and in full expention. It has changed the technology more than anyone else.  It will be remembered forever.  R.I.P Steve Jobs. 
To all of Steve's family, our thoughts and prayers.  A truly remarkable person who all will remember as a true visionary.  We will miss you Steve, rest in peace.
I would like to express my sympathy to the family of Steve Jobs. He was truly a visionary who changed the way we use a phone, listen to music and communicate with family and friends. He will be missed but his legacy and spectacular achievements will live on.&nbsp;
I am 59 years old, and was blessed to live in a time when computers evolved from big, blinking machines to things we put in our pockets. For years I worked at a very large, amazing computer  company, Digital Equipment, but it wasn't until I bought  my first Mac in 1984 that I understood what was truly possible.  Yes, I was and am an Apple fanatic. I got the elegance of the Mac, I loved the simplicity of the iPod, the power of the iPhone. And I loved the vision, drive and insight that Steve had. It transformed computing in ways that we may never appreciate.  I was deeply saddened by Steve's passing. He touched my life in so many ways, and I am so thankful for all he - and the staff at Apple - did for us all.  God speed, Steve. &nbsp;
Although a new Apple IMac and Apple MacBookAir owner, I remember back in  elementary school (1982) my first experience with a Mac computer and  floppy disk.  That image of the colored apple is forever in my mind  thanks to Mr. Jobs innovation.  Just as I was amazed back then with his  invention, now too I'm at awe to see how his vision developed an  extraordinary company offering consumers a wide range of products  unsurpassed in the industry.  My deepest condolences go out to his family during these challenging  times...  May God keep him!  Thank you.. 
Truly changed how we use devices, left his mark. Peace be with him for ever more. 
Steve, you should have stayed crazy in this world for longer time. Anyway, It might be a time for you to go crazy up there in a heaven. Have fun up there, make that place be a better place too. <br>
Steve Jobs is an amazing human being, he created a world that we couldn't even dream of and challenged others to go beyond their own imagination. He is a true genius and I can't even begin to explain how much he's changed my world.
Dear Steve  Thank you for bring our family together, across continents and generations, in such a delightful way.  You've made our world a better place. <br>
I offer my condolences to Steve Jobs and his family, and wish them all  the best. Steve Jobs was a great man that greatly shaped how the world  is today.  RIP Steve 
We will always remember Steve, the iMaster!&nbsp;
Thank you for your life in my life time.&nbsp;
Dear  Steve Jobs,  Was a big fan Really cheers for good work  We deepest sympathies.
My condolences to his family and well wishers. Steve you were a legend. A true inspiration. You will be remembered for long. I am very sad to see this news on the apple webpage. You were the true hero of this digital era. You have set the standards so high that people enjoy great devices today. You brought a revolution in mobile computing. May your soul rest in peace. <br>
 RIP Steve Jobs! Thank you for all your contributions to the world...you changed how we live our lives!&nbsp;
Good bye Mr. Jobs, thank you for your mac and "i" products, Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve! You changed the world. Long live apple "We will find a way or make one" 
 Condolences to the family and will always remember you&nbsp;
In 1998, my uncle gave me a second hand Apple Macintosh 512 when most of  my friends used PC with DOS. A small, beautiful computer. I didn't  realize that from that day, my life change and I never want to leave  Apple product since. Everything I own is related to Apple. I owe all  this to you, Steve. Even though we never met, I feel tears in my eyes as  losing part of my family. I will always remember you. Rest in peace  Steve, may we see each other in Heaven... 
As of tomorrow the world is a different place. 
Steve  I feel that I lost some part of my family. To Mr. Jobs wife and   children I will keep you in my prayers.&nbsp;
He has been absolute North for me for a very long time. I hope that he has found peace. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family.
You are in inspiration to us all. We send lots of love and support to the family and say a prayer for  those left behind.
Words are meaningless now.&nbsp;
I'm guessing they needed a little innovative thinking upstairs, so the Big Guy went for the most obvious choice. RIP Steve. Look forward to the iHeaven app. 
You made the world of the future I was promised as a young fella in the 60s and 70s a reality.   RIP.&nbsp;
Hi Steve  I am one of the billion that admire you..... I am one of the billion that respect you..... I am one of the billion that lerned from you..... I am one of the billion that inspired from you..... I am one of the billion that wished to know you.... And .... I am one of the billion that remember you.....  You did change the world ! And your legacy and your friends,  will change it  again !
My deeply condolences in a dark hour but thanks Steve you change the mind of the world&nbsp;
Steve brought music into my life. He made a difference in the lives of millions like me. He made a difference in the world...  R.I.P. Steve 
Steve jobs was a source of constant inspiration in my life. The world is a dimmer place without his shining example.&nbsp;
I am nothing more than a little gadget lover from Birmingham, Alabama   but I wanted to express my condolences. His inspiration truly shows in   everything Apple does and I appreciate everything.&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs,  I know we have never met but if we had I would have thanked you and told  you about all the things that you have done for me. You devotion to your  products, company and fans was unmatched and will not be forgotten. You  are and have always been a hero to me and I wish you could hear me when  I say "Thank you for being the man you were and I only wish you could  have been with us longer"&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for the creative and innovative products that you have shared with so many people.  I love Apple products and I will continue to enjoy and use the products in Mr. Jobs memory. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. 
Words cannot express what Steve Jobs did for the world, for everyone who  has ever used a computer, smartphone or tablet. His memory will live on  through Apple and in the hearts and minds of everyone who has ever used  an Apple product. The world has lost a creative genius, a virtuosic presenter and an  inspiring leader.&nbsp;
I just wanted to say thank you Steve and your apple crew. You are really amazing, and we greatly appreciate what you've done for this world. You've made this world become so much better. I am a true apple fan and it was heartbroken to hear that you've passed away. Rest in peace Steve. You are above the iCloud now.&nbsp;
 Rest in Peace Steve Jobs and thank you very much for all your amazing  and life changing work and life history!  You will always be an extraordinary example to be followed. My thought goes to your family and friends.   Thank you very much Steve Jobs!    
The world will never be the same. &nbsp;RIP Steve.......  I am sad for you and your family.  RIP man...&nbsp;
My thoughts and prayers with Steve’s family, friends, co-workers and staff at Apple.  Rest in peace Steve.
Thank you Steve Jobs for making my iphone and ipod touch, i would be lost without them. Thank you for inspiring me to go beyond my limits and to live everyday as if its my last. You have really changed my life. 
Condolences from Brazil  Thanks for your visionary way and to make it available to all&nbsp;<div>of us. You will be remembered everyday, everyday. rest in peace &nbsp;</div>
I wish to extend my sympathy to Steve's family on his passing from this  earth. I am so thankful for the wonderful visionary that Steve was. My  first ever computer was a Mac II, and I followed Apple ever since,  purchasing nearly every new Mac that surfaced. May God bless and comfort  Steve's family at this time of loss.
My deepest condolences to the friends and family of Steve Jobs.  Although I never knew the man, I feel a sense of loss.  This man changed the world around me and I am grateful for having shared the planet with this brilliant man.     Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
Although our office has been responsible for most of Apple's flagship  stores, I never had the privilege to work on those projects, let alone  work with Steve. To me, his sense of design aesthetic, where less truly  is more; his vision to see where we all are headed, or could be headed,  long before we had that sense ourselves; his sensibility and creativity  to connect man and machine to one another in a way that is natural and  intuitive; and his genius to transform animation into a new art-form are  just a few of the many qualities that will always set him apart. We all  lost a great friend today. My deepest sympathy to Steve's family, as  well as the Apple and Pixar communities.
You changed the world.&nbsp;
God bless his soul.  He was surely one of the greatest mind of our time.&nbsp;
Thank you for your amazing products and your vision  with respect to our electronic world!! You are such an incredible human being, Thank you 
My sincere condolences, it's a terrible loss for the world. Such a brilliant inteligence and creativity should live forever.  R.I.P Steve Jobs 
I'm an artist and a graphic designer, and I just wanted to say that because he did what he loved (and did it well), Steve Jobs has let me do what I have a passion for as well. Without his creativity and inspiration, I wouldn't have the tools to do what I do. Apple facilitates a lot of my creative process, and makes my life so much easier. I couldn't imagine trying to get by without my MacBook, iPod, or iPhone. He was truly an inspiring person.&nbsp;
I feel so sad. I never met Steve Jobs but I feel as if I know him, for his work had  touched my life in so many beautiful ways. A loss for all the world. An amazing visionary with the ability to materialise his vision. Rest in peace Steve. I love you. :( 
Apple:     I am sorry to hear of your loss. Jobs was a great man, both personally and knowledgably. His innovations have changed technology forever, and his spirit will live on. I would also like to extend my deepest condolences to the Jobs family for their loss.&nbsp;
Steve, thank you for your Genius. You left us too early.   You definitely put a ding in the Universe!!!  God Bless...
To Apple,  It is only so often that someone or something comes along that motivates us to change the path we are on.  I had been a PC user for 16 years when by chance I was introduced a small white Mac laptop that blew my mind with what it could do with photos and video.  Finally I felt that "Hollywood" was within my grasp and at that moment I converted to Apple forever.  It seems that Steve Jobs knew what we were all thinking and wanting.  Make music, photography and film available to everybody on beautiful powerful machines that just work.  For changing my world for the better with your vision and innovation ­ Thank you.  I promote your legacy every day.&nbsp;
The news came this afternoon on my iPad.  My family survives on Mac, iPads, iPhones, and even an old iPod Mini.  There's a Mac SE/30 and original Bondi Blue iMac downstairs that I can't stand to part with.  Apple's products changed our lives.  Steve led the incredible team that invented this stuff.  Thank you Steve Jobs.  I look forward to buying the new Apple products that he will continue to inspire.&nbsp;
Dear Mrs. Jobs &amp; family,  to future generations, you are blessed with tomorrow because Steve walked with us today.  and to his family, may his memory be a blessing for you and your future  generations. Thank you.  
Dear Steve's family and friends,  Our prayers are with you all. Although I have never met Steve, I felt that I know him well as a friend who helped me by letting me play with MacBook Pro every day.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs, everything you've done in life has inspired me in so many ways  so far, and I'm sure what you've done in your life will continue to  inspire me in so many ways in my future.  Rest in peace Steve.
 Thanks to Steve Jobs for think the products I use every day at my home, college and everywhere! The best man create the best company at the moment!. R.I.P.
 Thank you for amazing vision, we truly miss you ! Now heaven is a better pla ce because of you and who knows maybe now you will continue to work with God  and Angels to develop incredible heaven devices so when we get there we wil l be inspired again by your creativity.
 I would like to send my condolences to the family of Steve Jobs;  his wife and four children.    I am a 66 year old woman who never touched a computer until I was in my fifties.  My Son in Law is a huge Mac fan and was always after me to try a Mac.  He said it was easy and user friendly and I would be able to use it easily.  I resisted for a while but he and my daughter bought a new Mac and gave me their old Mac...I was hooked.  I have had three Mac Desktops and last year at the age of 65 my three kids all chipped in and bought me an iPad.  They have created a monster.  I am amazed at the technology that goes into the iPad.  It has opened up a whole new world for me.  Steve Jobs never knew me but he gave me a wonderful gift with his technology.  It enriches my life.  Thank you Steve Jobs.  May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Jobs may have died, but I still have him in my MacBook, my iPod, my  iPhone and my iPad. His body may be gone, but Steve himself will remain  in millions of citizens all around the world.  Wish I had the pleasure to meet a true visionary and a fighter. &nbsp;
To a man who stood for what he believed, pushed forward, continuously broke out of his comfort zone and succeed at making big changes to the world for the better.     Your legacy will forever live on and foster new talents all over the world through inspiration and admiration.     May you finally rest in peace.     You will be greatly missed.  
Steve,  The World is worse now that you have left it. Your work has given me inspiration, joy and fellowship of others who saw what you showed us in the seventies. It was one heck of a journey with you for almost four decades.    Steve, rest in peace. You will always live in our hearts.... Farewell. &nbsp;PS: The Apple ][ that you built still works today, and I still 3D0G it...  
Steve made my childhood dream of walking around with my own sound track  come true with the launch of the ipod. For that, he will always be a  part of my life. Thank you Steve 
Steve Jobs has left an indelible mark on this planet.  His vision has revolutionized the way we work, play and live.  Today the world lost a great businessman, leader, visionary and friend.  I only hope to cram as much in my life as Steve did in his 56 years here. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Jobs family in this most difficult time.
I am so deeply saddened, I can't quite describe it in words.  Overwhelming emotion grips me and tears come to my eyes, because of the death of a man I never met. I knew he would pass, probably soon after his retiring from Apple, but so soon? Although I have never met him personally, I am infinitely grateful to have had the opportunity to learn from Steve by him being pure and straight forward as the visionory he was. I will miss him, his presence in the world, his influence on the world, and the positive influence he has had on my life. I do not think there is another person that I could be so sad about his or her passing other than my own family, or closest friends. I send my heartfelt condolences to his family, and his close friends.
I will always remember you Steve Jobs and your famous quote will follow me forever; stay hungry, stay foolish. You changed the world and as apple would say revolutionized it and it will never be the same. I know you were wise to who you have passed down your job, but you will always be the first and only Apple CEO. Everything that you have done has been a success and you never will have really left us because you will be in our hearts and minds until the end of time generation after generation. I thank you for the world of apple t hat you have given us. I wish you, your family, and all of Apple the best and hope that you are no longer suffering and are in a better place. Unfortunately I was not given the opportunity to share an event with you, but I know t hat if I was it would have been magical and irreplaceable. God bless everyone affected by this tragic event. Thank you Steve Jobs 
…As a Graphic Designer. From the first Apple I used in 3rd grade to the Mac's I've used for over 20 years now.  I have always been a "Mac Baby" and will continue to hold my Apple Torch!!!!!!!!!!  Rest In Peace, Steve, and THANK YOU for making the World a better, more innovative, more beautiful place. You will be deeply missed.
Hello Steve, This might be the only and last chance that I can speak to you directly. Thank you to bring the world to another experience level. To work with you genius is one of my biggest dream, but you doesn't let me to get it. Take care and I will miss you forever. 
I never remember looking into a phone and feeling as alive as I did when I got my first iPhone.  I never saw people's lives change like when our company was set up with iPhone access to our network.  Amen Steve Jobs....Amen. 
Rest in peace. You will be missed.&nbsp;
What a loss!!!! He brought us so much, all my sincere condolences to his family, friends and  colleagues. Rest In Peace Steve!!!&nbsp;
May god bless his soul and condolences to the family.&nbsp;
Too bad you died Steve Jobs! The world becomes less and less creative. We'll miss you.
You've inspired more than you could ever imagine. The world has lost a  precious soul. Take care Steve.
I own both a Mac and a Windows computer and I can honestly say that the whole user experience of Mac OS X is by far better. Not only is it simple but it's actually fun to use. Mr. Jobs knew that the most important thing was the user experience and that it  was more important than looks, power, or cost. He wasn't just a powerful contributor to Apple but had great power in the whole industry. His products were the pinnacle of what people wanted and every company knew that and tried to copy their products ever so slightly but to consumers we knew the difference and no matter how hard they tried they could not get the same feelings from their products that Apple could. He will always be known for how he changed the tech world as well as the rest of the world. I'm sorry for your loss Apple.  R.I.P Steve Jobs
I'm so sorry! It is not only a loss for Apple, it is a loss for the  world! He was a big role model for me!!!  Rest in Peace Steve!&nbsp;
Thank you for your gifts to the world. We miss you already. 
He is the reason I converted to Apple.  I honestly dreamt of the the day I would meet him and say thank you for  making me fall in love with technology, but now seems that has been  taken away from me.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his family cause we are all going to  miss him.  Goodbye Steve we will never forget you...  Forever Apple. 
It's amazing and you did it Steve! You changed the world!!!&nbsp;Rest in peace with the certainty you will be forever remembered!!!!&nbsp;
to all who knew him from someone who like so many felt like he did.   Steve inspired my career in high-tech and passion for learning by  creating.  I know his spirit will always be present at Apple, but his  physical presence will be greatly missed.  My prayers and thoughts are  with his family, friends, and everyone at Apple.  Peace and all good
Thanks for everything, Steve. You have changed our lives for the better.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs was my hero.  And that's all I have to say.
His soul will keep on shining close to us each time we enhance our minds and lives through his uncountable innovations.  May he rest in peace. 
My heart goes out to the family of Steve Jobs.  My iMac, iPhone and iPad are crying and so am I.&nbsp;
Steve's genius has empowered human creativity in ways that are impossible to quantify. He will be missed.
Dear Apple Family, We feel deeply for your loss. &nbsp;Steve's personality has inspired people all around the world.
My deepest condolences to Steve's family, friends and Apple.  The world has lost an extraordinary human.  His legacy, vision and dream set the standard of excellence.  He will always be remembered as the man who truly cared.   Bless his soul.
My deepest condolences to the man who have change the world, who make  everything look so possible. You're not here anymore. But all of you've  made will be inspiring forever. Thanks for the great gadget. I know dat  you will made a innovative breakthrough in heaven, so will you built a  new gadget to connecting people between world and heaven? i'll be  waiting. :'( such a passionate person!! goodbye, Steve.
We all love you. R.I.P.&nbsp;
When was there a time that Apple didn't play a part in my life?  We have so much to thank him for, yet the profound and deep sorrow at Steve's passing is just too devastating to really digest at this time.    The world respected and loved you- and didn't always agree with you.  But the fact remains.. you are my personal hero.  I will miss you every single day, especially during what remains of a Macworld in SF.  I'll go again this year even though I had not planned to go.. just one more time in your part of the world- to say my goodbye.  My heart is broken.&nbsp;
I look at my daughter's face, see her smile, make her laugh, help her with homework. I am away from home, on the road, but in my hand, a wonderful device that connects me to home and family wherever I am. My iPad 2 reaches across  the vastness to my daughter's iPhone 4 and suddenly we are together. Thank you Steve Jobs for making this possible. You were a gift to mankind and most certainly a gift to heaven.
 You were and still are truly an inspiration to anyone with a dream and the determination to make it a reality. Though I didn't know you personally I still feel your presence and even more immensely now your lost. I take solace in knowing I had the honor to live in and share your era not to mention the esteem privilege to benefit from your genius. You are the epitome of innovation and revolution. Your accomplishments will never be forgotten. R.I.P. Steve Jobs.
 Steve Jobs will be remembered as one of the great American  visionaries of our time. His leadership, passion for excellence and  desire for innovation has changed the world beyond measure. My use of Apple computers go back to the early 1980s. As I type  this on my iMac I can't help but consider how much Steve's company has  changed the way I live life. Although Steve is no longer with us I will  remember this great man every time I use an Apple product. I thank God  for what this man's innovations and workmanship allows me to accomplish.   At this point my prayers are with his family as they go through  this time of grief. While the world lost a great leader, I sympathize  with his family, friends and employees who lost the man. May God's peace  be with you in the days and weeks ahead.&nbsp;
You will always be a household name at our home.
May your soul rest in peace. You are in a better place. May the Lord comfort your family. You will forever be missed. 
Our era has lost its Leonardo da Vinci, its Thomas Edison, its Galileo.  His  genius expressed through Apple changed the face of technology and changed the world around us.  We honor his life and extraordinary accomplishments.  We shed tears today with the news of his passing and share in your loss.
Thank you Steve Jobs changing the world, I cannot imagine my life with out the technology he created. 
 Steve's innovations defined what in the future of humankind will be  called the technological revolution, and he will truly be remembered as  the first pioneer. Steve served as the heart and soul of the 21st  century with his innovations and contributions to an ever growing  technological world. His enthusiasm and creativity were unmatched in the  world of technology, he was a true master of his craft, a modern Da  Vinci. He is gone, but truly will never be forgotten. My condolences to Apple and the family of Mr. Jobs
Steve,  Thank you for your vision. You proved time and time again that something as complex and intricate as a computer can be made accessible for anyone to understand. It's amazing watching a 2-year old navigate around a iPad so easily and naturally. It's amazing watching a graphic designer create amazing animations on a powerful 12-core desktop.  Computers are supposed to be powerful things. But you've proved they can also be elementary to operate.  Thanks you Steve.&nbsp;
Thank you for everything, generations over generations will be remembering you Steve! &nbsp;
I am very sad to hear about the death of Steve Jobs. His innovations are a part of my daily life. He is a hero of the technological world!  Thank you Mr.Jobs for all contributions, you will be dearly missed. &nbsp;
 Just want to send my condolences to the entire Apple family and the Jobs Family.  If it wasn't for Apple and Steve Jobs, I wouldn't have gotten hooked on graphic design with those wonderful computers 30 years ago!  Thank you Steve.
You've been the hugest inspiration to me. Thank you for all  the things you brought into technology, animation, and those  great keynotes. They will stay with us for a long time. We  will miss your presence.  Lighting a candle for tonight.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I am shocked and saddened, but so grateful for all that Steve and Apple  has given us. He changed our technical world with such beauty and  imagination. I'm all "Apple." 
I never realized how much Steve has changed my life, if there was no Apple... I don't even know.  For sure my life would not be the same.  I just wish he could have worn that black turtle neck and and those blue jeans just one more time.  Steve changed so many lives, he changed the world.  Who know where we would be without him.  I just hope his legacy will live on and that Apple, which will be forever change, will continue and follow his goals and hopefully one day reach them.  My iPhone 3GS sits next to me and I wonder if it will still turn on.  --  *Thank You Steve* * * 
He was an extraordinary man who made an entire empire with his friends.The  world has lost one of the nicest smartest people. 
I remember working closely with Steve when he founded and owned NeXT   Computer, Inc.. My small company worked side by side with Steve and a group of extremely gifted engineers to bring NeXTStep to the   masses. It was never a "we cannot make this happen" attitude, it was a "we will make this happen" attitude. We pushed the envelope and truly   developed what is today the underpinnings of Mac OS X. When Steve   rejoined Apple, I knew the future would be bright and the groundwork   that was laid would help generations to come. It has.  Rest In Peace Steve..... you are missed, but your legacy will live on.
 How can someone I have never met, have such a profound impact on my life? Steve Jobs did.   He introduced me to computers and made me fall in love. He made it so easy and so cool to be a little geeky.  Thank You Steve, for the past 22 years, you have been a mentor to millions.&nbsp;
i have used an Apple computer for at least 20 years. My children use them as well as iPods, itouch, iPads, and iPhones.  Today's news felt like I lost a friend, someone who has been in my life for a very long time and has kept giving me the coolest gifts.  Steve was a gift to this world.  goodbye friend. 
My condolences to all the family, friends and co-workers of Steve Jobs.  He was literally a one in a billion creator, innovator and entrepreneur.  More importantly he was a wonderful human being who inspired millions to think differently.  He was one of those rarest of people who can honestly say that they truly changed the world.  The world is feeling his loss tonight, and we will all miss him.
I know, like most senders to this email address, did not have the opportunity to meet Steve Jobs in person. Although, that is not to say we did not know Steve. Steve Jobs lived and lives on vicariously through everything that apple has accomplished. He has inspired and changed the lives of millions. I want to be short with this email but ultimately I want to thank Steve Jobs for creating and believing in a vision that has been so empowering over the last few decades.
The visionary who made Apple. The legacy.&nbsp;I will miss Steve dearly. 
I have no words to express my sadness. Steve will be remembered as a sculptor to turn technology into masterpieces.
Just yesterday I wrote my first blog, aptly named "My obsession with  Steve Jobs". Had I known we would lose him forever, I would have kept  going. I am humbled by Steve Jobs. I never met him, nor will I ever, but  he will hold a place in my heart. He changed our lives, he changed our  World, and most importantly, he changed my kids' World. Thank you Steve,  for making our lives so fun. You will forever inspire me to be greater.  Thank you for making me want to be not only a better person, but also a  greater person. May God rest your soul.
RIP Steve, you will always be the person I think of when new and exciting technology is launched!
There are few people that leave an indelible mark on the world and mankind. One of those people was Steve Jobs.     It's been refreshing and inspiring to watch him single handedly change the world we live in for the better.      Thanks for leaving your legacy.
I've been an Apple user and supporter ever since I was a little kid. I remember when Steve introduced the Macintosh computer in 1984 and I think we all remember the commercial. It was Steve who innovated and invigorated the computer and technology industry.  I will forever be an Apple user and supporter, because of Steve. Thank you Steve, for all that you have done...for us Apple lovers...and The World.&nbsp;
To whom may concern,      We are shocked to hear this sad news. It's Steve who makes our life better, makes the dream come true, makes the impossible turn possible.      Thank you! Steve Jobs!
Steve Jobs may you rest in peace. Even though most of us have never met you personally, I know that you had a very big heart for your family and people around you. You were a very creative genius and the great thing is you were passionate about what you worked for and changed the world for many others. You will be greatly missed and never forgotten, not just for working at Apple but for being a great guy in general. If more people had your attitude the world would be a friendly place. Thank you for all of the things that you have done and for the people you have changed.
Godspeed Steve Jobs.  You will be missed tremendously, but remembered indefinitely.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to Steve's family and friends, he has made his mark in this world and a positive impact on millions. He is certainly an inspiration who will always be remembered.
Love you forever Steve! Rest in Peace... 
R.I.P. Steve Jobs. You will be missed.
He will be missed greatly, I am only happy that he no longer has to suffer as he was. I pray that the cure may be found.
I thank you for creating the iPhone that I am sending email on. You were a true inspiration to me. You taught me to always press on to your Goal. Do the  impossible. I look forward to seeing you in heaven and having a nice cup of  coffee up there! I will never forget you.
Thank you Steve for giving a human face to technology.&nbsp;
Rest In Peace Steve, your vision and drive made Apple what it is today. Apple's products bring joy to my family and I each and every day, from music to homework to fun to memories.  I thank you and wish your family peace and love.&nbsp;
It is with great sadness that I send this message. We send our condolences to Apple and the family of Steve Jobs.  Without Mr. Jobs we would not have many of the innovations in technology that has shaped our world today.  Our prayers are with the Jobs and Apple family. &nbsp;
To Steve's family,  I'm personally sorry to hear of his passing, but know there will be many amazing times that you will have had with him as well, and hopefully you can think of these times.  I imagine he was dedicated to his work, so I feel a little guilty that I have gained from those times he wasn't with you. My life in computers was influenced by his creations.  Thank you for sharing him with us.&nbsp;
It is a sad loss today that Steve Jobs has passed away. Words cannot express what he accomplished in the IT world. The world has lost a great inventor. He will be remembered. I hope that Apple will continue to invent and think like Steve Jobs when they design and develop. Today marks a sad day for all of us.&nbsp;
Thanks for your vision and passion for a better world. My kids will know one  day of your works. We'll miss u.
As one who recently purchased a Macbook Pro, I never cease to be amazed  by all the unique things this computer can do - kind of like if I can  think it my Pro can likely do it. Can't imagine how a human becomes  neurologically wired with the innovative mind that Steve Jobs employed.  Hopefully he would be pleased knowing that every Apple product in the  hands of someone doing good and trying to better the human race is an  extension of handiwork living on. &nbsp;You will be profoundly and sorely missed, Steve Jobs.
Hello I write this note in reaction to the news of Steve passing. I am clear   life has its cycle and we all have to face it. Some of us understand   this more than others.  The ones that define courage, show faith and   inspire help all of define and understand what our time on this planet   can be. Steve Jobs was one of those people.  I have been an apple   consumer since 1992. I have grown my creative and personal being on   the machine he helped to create. The experience of information exchange and idea development has made a   marked impact on my life. For many years I suppose I disassociated   this machine with the person behind it.  The brilliant design and the   ease of use make it seamless and almost not that of human hands. The   profound human, that being Steve jobs, has over the years had me   reconsider who I am, how I do business and truly how I do life. It has   been a pathway to my livelihood in this new digital age.    Apple whether one admits it or not, has change the lives of most   forever. The impact of apple breakthroughs has flipped culture. it   take the vision of a small band of few to impact so many.  I am   honored to be living in this age to have seen and experienced such a   shift in our civilization brought on by the advent of such genius. To Steve family my condolences, as a consumer I feel the lost   i can   only imagine what pain you must endure losing Steve.  As you will know   Steve lives in every pocket that has an an Ipod , every ear that puts   an phone to it, every finger that swipes and Ipad  and etc. Steve has   been part of a global shift. One that will forever be part of i   history. i am honored to be alive  and to have been experienced Mr.   jobs vision come to fruition.&nbsp;
Thank you for your Vision.  We are forever grateful.  What a loss for all of us and especially for those who knew you and of course, your family.  You, however, are off on new adventures. Namaste.
I don't have many heroes, but I am proud to say that Steve Jobs will always   be my hero! He taught me how to dream. He taught me how to live. He taught  me  passion for life. He taught me how to die! I will always love his  example of  life!  Praying for his family. May he rest in peace!!!!!!!&nbsp;
  Thank you for impacting our world! A genious, a leader, ONE inspiration!!!&nbsp;
Thank you for all you've done for us in bridging the gap between humans and technology. You will always be remembered as a visionary and a legend. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Dear Mr. Jobs,  You've brought so much to the world in a short life. You can finally take a rest without jobs... R.I.P. Mr. Jobs!   With most respect from a fan of you. 
Rest in peace Steve Jobs!   you will be missed!&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs-  I will think of you every time I use one of my many Apple products. You  have done so much for the world. Your advancements in technology have  brought advancements not only to daily convenience, but also to  education and the workforce.  May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
My heartfelt condolences to Mr. Jobs’ family. May they find strength in prayer during this difficult time. The world is a better place because of him.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs made me fall in love with apple back when the first generation of  the iPod touch was designed and released. I wonder what will happen to apple? Will it keep on its path? Or go in a new path of technology? All i hope is that apple will still make the amazing  products that Steve Jobs has helped make a reality. You will be missed by me and my family I will forever own an apple product. R.I.P dear friend. you may be gone but your company will live on and each product made and sold will have a part of you within it. 
Thank you.  I grew up in Oakland, my first computer at home was the Macintosh LC.  Words can't describe how you have helped me by allowing me to communicate in ways that previously were not possible.&nbsp;
Steve jobs is a great man, although I do not know him personally I  believe he is visionary and a technological genius. Only he could have  raised a company as great as yours. Rest in peace Mr. Jobs you will be missed.
R.I.P Steve Jobs...you will be missed!! Thank you for making this world a better place with your innovations and your creativity!
Wishing all at Apple my sympathy.  I think the whole world knows what a visionary and bright spark of humanity was lost today.  I have all faith that his spirit will live on with you all.
Trying to think of words to say...  The loss of a creative genius leave us simply wondering 'What if?'    This loss of life is truly gutting.   But it's the loss of potential,         the loss of what could have come;                   what would have come;          that is the devastating tragedy.  My condolences and deepest thanks go to those who surrounded him.  Great leadership takes great people, and Steve was a master among men.&nbsp;
May the soul of this genius and visionary human being rest in peace!! I  am deeply saddened even though I never did know him or work for/with  him. I am an Apple buff and only he could have done what he had with a  brand as great as Apple. Hope his visions continue on with his  successors and we have more to remember him with.&nbsp;
Thank you for all you have done.&nbsp;
This is really sad. Steve Jobs was my role model. I grew up looking at  his success and at his amazing products. I will always be an Apple  fanboy and I will always remember Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs is my hero.  He gave me the best thing in my life. I'll pay it forward.  May his spirit rest in peace.&nbsp;
It was an honor and a pleasure sharing the earth with you.  My  sympathies to your family.  RIP  
But you brought me the tools.  Thanks.&nbsp;
Please Rest In Peace!!!
Steve, you were the greatest. You can look back and be proud of your work. Always remembering. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I'm sorry that you had to die Steve, and die so soon. You gave me the dream of a lifetime with your products, and made me change my life so that I could get to them. I thank you for revolutionizing a product into a dream, and I congratulate you on touching so many hearts, through only your hard work and imaginative vision. You were a dedicated professional, and a creative genius. And above all of it, you were you a good person, something that shone through your smile. I wish you find your place in heaven.&nbsp;
Thank you for the best phone the best laptops and tablets. You were a smart man and help us all see the new way of technology. You will be miss but never  forgotten. Anywhere and everywhere you will be remembered. My you rest in peace. Thank you once more Steve.
Steve may not have known my name but he sure knew what I liked. His constant Innovation in the world of technology has pushed and inspired me to make a difference in my own life. I will always remember these famous words that Steve said for they will keep me going for the rest of my life "stay hungry, stay foolish". Thank you Steve for everything. You are and will always be my hero. 
Steve was a great man. A legend. The god of the tech industry. It's such a shame we have lost such an inspirational man. I am only a kid, but have been touched by the creativity of this man. He was a legend, and will forever live  in our hearts. All virtual lighters lit to Steve Jobs.
I have been an Apple fan since the Macintosh 6116, and have always always looked forward to watching Steve revolutionize our lives since then. Through the time where Mac users were a subcultural minority of the computer users, to the mainstream Apple of today, I have thoroughly enjoyed following him and using Apple products. Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
I still stuned because of your commencement speech : "No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to  die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one  has ever escaped it.... Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't  let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And  most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.  They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary." (Jobs)  Thanks for everything u did . Not only me, all the world say thanks to you . Good job Jobs. RIP
I here by offer my deepest condolences to Steve Jobs, he changed the Computer industry forever taking it out of the Dark ages and bringing it to the 21st Century. Your vision has Shaped our future. Steve is now resting in the great iCloud in the sky. RIP Steve, I will miss you. &nbsp;
What a  loss! He converted me to the iPhone and I haven't looked back since.     We will miss that great man!!!
My deepest condolences for the family, Apple and the world. Steve Jobs has been an inspiration for innovation and revolutionary leader of technology in the last 10 years. People around the world also hail him as a model presenter, even to the point of writing books about his presentation style. Steve Jobs is THE LEGEND.
I am not articulate enough to say what I feel at Steve's passing. I  guess the most truthful thing I can say is that he and his compatriots not only made me see that magic exists but that magic is a useful  and necessary part of our lives.  Thank you Steve 
You changed the world starting out in your garage with your college  buddies. You grew an empire based on your dream. A visionary above  visionaries. You've impacted my life as an artist and you will be sorely  missed.
 Big Steve, You did what almost all the people in the world couldn't do, you created inventions that helped everybody and solved impossible problems. You are the biggest genius that the humanity could know.  Dear Jobs, Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
My sincerely condolences to Steve's family and friends. I feel that I   also lost a friend that never had a chance of meeting.
I extend my deepest condolences to the family, friends and coworkers. Steve changed my way of seeing and feeling the world. He will live forever in our hearts.&nbsp;
Steve is, and always will be my inspiration. The world now has a giant hole left in it that will never be filled with the likes again.  We will all miss you, rest in peace.&nbsp;
You have been an inspiration to many. Your creativity has enlightened  many in the world today. You have been an idol to plentiful who looked  up to you. May you rest in peace and everyone we remember your impact on  society and the way we live now. Your products have changed the world  and your death has left us stunned, but we will always remember you as  the one that started it all. I will continue to use your products till the day i die and i just want  you to know that you have been a great great man doing what you did. &nbsp;Thank you 
"The Wizard of Silicon Valley" passes away...&nbsp;
Thank you for not hesitating and not being scared to think different, to  think about tomorrow, have the courage to move forward and let go of old  things and ideas, and bring the new ways, new perspectives, new risks  and achievements and push us for a better tomorrow, where we can  progress as the human race! With sadness in heart, but a big gratefulness for all you made for us,  Rest in peace and let people learn from you for generations to come!  Condolences to the closest people and family,  We mourn together with you!!!&nbsp;
I want to express my profound sadness at the news of Steve Jobs' death.  It is overwhelming to realize that he is gone from this life.  He was an unbelievable person who touched all of our lives in ways we may not even fully realize yet.  I cared for Steve Jobs as though he were my friend, my brother, my mentor - even though I never had the pleasure of meeting him in person.  He felt like he was right 'there' for us.  May his family, close friends and colleagues be at peace, knowing Steve is no longer suffering with his illness. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.  You will always remain in my heart, memory and prayers. Thank you for the gift of you!&nbsp;
God rest his soul.  He will indeed be counted among history's greats.
You were inspiring and passionate.  Captain of industry and one of the greatest American innovators, you stood a Titan. A man to be admired and emulated. The world will miss you dearly.
  Seems like the angels have hired Steve Jobs! They love Apples too:-) But we sure will miss you dearest Steve!&nbsp;
I have enjoyed Apple products for many years.  Steve Jobs is the reason  the products are so highly regarded.  I just want to say thank you for all the good  things you did to touch our lives.  We have lost a really creative genius. Well done, Steve  Jobs.  We will never forget you-or your wonderful contributions to the world. God  Bless You. 
RIP Mr. Jobs, thank you for all of your tireless work to make this world a better place. You will be greatly missed. Condolences to the Jobs family and the Apple family.
Finally I understand why the new iPhone was called iPhone 4s. iPhone 4s  iPhone for Steve.   We feel so sad for the losing of  a brilliant and a true hero of the world.  Steve, you changed the way we live.  May your legacy live on.  A fan of you.
I write this with an heavy heart knowing that Mr. Jobs has left us.  He invented and re-invented technology, and thru it reshaped the world for the better.  From the dawn of personal computing with the Apple II, to the digital lifeline that is the iPhone.  His vision will be sorely missed.  Though I never had the honor of meeting him, he touched my life beyond measure from that first Apple in grade school, to the MBP, iPad 2 and iPhone 4 that sits on my desk now, and all he Macs in between.  My thoughts are will all the Apple family on this dark day, but I am confident his spirt and genius will live on @ 1 Infinite Loop and the insanely great products that it will continue to inspire!
I can't think of any other individual who has made technology so  fashionable and fun for the masses. RIP Steve 
Dear Steve Jobs,  My prayers are with your family and friends. It must be hard losing such a terrific figure in their lives. I just wanted to say thank you for making such a huge difference in this world, revolutionizing the computer, the mp3 player, and the mobile phone. You are truly a wonderful role model to the entire world. The one thing that really stood out to me about you, is how you lived your life to the fullest. I recall you saying once that it didn't matter to you if you were the richest man in the cemetery, you just wanted to make something wonderful happen everyday. I believe you were able to accomplish this. Its a sad day for the world. Rest in Peace.  God Bless. 
 We will miss him, the outstanding genius, the greatest CEO, the amazing creator and our close friend.   His spirit is not only the foundation of Apple, but also the foundation of our society.
I bought everything he created because I believed in him and in everything he created. He cared about us from computers that changed the world to giving us music, books, and children's stories through Pixar. He was a visionary that took us from boring gray boxes to exciting adventures with computers. I miss him even though I never met him. I cannot imagine the grief of those who knew him. He wanted simple elegant tools meant to enhance our lives to be his legacy. He has succeeded 
What a ride!  You have made a path to the future for all mankind unlike  anyone before you. Rest in peace Steve Jobs
Steve was the Thomas Edison of our time. He will be known for ever as  one of the greatest inventors.
To the entire Apple Family,  My dearest sympathies and regards go out to the Friends and Family of Steve Jobs. Though I am young in comparison to the legacy that Mr. Jobs left behind , he has left an impact on my life like no other Tech Visionary could. I wish that I could have had the privilege to meet him in life, but his vision and empire will live on forever in the lives of dedicated consumers and followers such as myself long after his death. I send my deepest condolences to those who were close to him, and may the spirit and joy that Steve Jobs spread throughout his life continue on in all of us.
Aloha Steve Jobs...Mahalo for giving me my first computer in 1987 (Apple IIe) and my latest Apple device iPad 2.  You have positively changed the world we live in today and you always be admired and remembered.  Mahalo &amp; God Bless...
the world is a better place because of Steve. Forever changed. It was   a privilege and a thrill to be alive during his time--to witness his   ups and downs, and to experience his passion and vision through   Apple's products. Prayers to the family and friends he leaves behind. May his legacy   live on forever, and like him may we strive to make the world a better   place with how we live. Thanks for everything, Steve. So many fond memories. You will be missed.
This e-mail is short, but with all my heart to a true genius who never have replacement, a true genius of the twentieth century, an inventor, a brilliant mind is gone. Apple is in mourning, not just Apple if not all of the technology community in the world.  You will always be in our minds and hearts. May you be a better world.  think different. 
may you r.i.p steve, and the angels surround you.
I will remember this day with great sadness following the death of Steve Jobs. He is the great idol of our time. He will certainly be received with happiness by God because he is an amazing human being.&nbsp;
To the crazy one, the rebel, the troublemaker, the one who saw things differently, the one who changed them and by doing so pushed the human race forward, to the one who changed our world  Thank you so much Steve. 
Dear Steve,  Thank you for giving us the best machines and operating systems in the world . You have done so much that it is difficult to recount every single invention that you have bestowed the World. You shall be sorely missed and we will remember you always as the man who was the heart of Apple. You have run the race, you have fought the good fight. Rest now Steve. You have earned it. We love you.
There is never gonna be such a person as Steve.
The world has lost what can only be described as a *legend*. May he bring all of his genius ideas up to the heavens above.  R.I.P. Steve! 
My heart breaks for Mr. Job's family and friends, as well as the dynasty  he built which is Apple. Heaven just got a lot smarter. 
Our condolences to the Jobs family. Steve's amazing persona will be missed but his inspiration and influence will last forever. My wife and I have been loyal Apple fans since 2001.  Our 2 young daughters have loved Apple since birth and they adore watching Pixar movies on our iPad . Thank you Steve and company for making products that are beautiful and fun to use.
A person of great talent who accomplished so much. He is an inspiration.  May his memory be a blessing to his family and friends. His success in  building businesses and creating opportunity for others is a legacy that  will be admired for many, many years. I can't think of a greater  contribution to make to the world than building a strong, successful  business that benefits employees, customers and investors while making  the world a better place. And Steve did it more than once.  Like so many others, I will never forget him.&nbsp;
October 5th 2011 will be remembered as one of the saddest days of our century.  Let's not forget the main lesson Steve has left us.  Believe in your dreams!  "And those who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."  Thank you Steve...  you'll be missed.
RIP Steve!! You are amongst the iclouds now!!  Be proud of yourself cause we  are proud of you! 
His Legacy won't be that he made good products, but that he made people's lives better through the use of them... 
Steve has been the reason I have loved anything about Apple. Such a visionary.. The world is truely going to miss him. iSalute Steve! &nbsp;
I don't have any kind of opportunity to meet with you, but i work in  Apple Premiun Reseller in Brazil and i feel and see all of you work  and i say is Beauty and Genius like you! Dear friend in this moment all  can i say  is "rest in peace." you deserve! Don't worry you work, company and specially you will be remembered for  decades!  You create a new world and it will be much bigger and always  has your mark. And the people who work on Apple will make the best effort to take all  knowledge created by you and push forward. And we here in Brazil will  make the same! For Apple and for You. Good bye Steve. All Apple, Apple community and people will miss you. We miss one father and mentor! Our sincere condolence
Steve's was a very special kind of genius; the kind that could take something as cold as a computer and infuse it with humanity.  Without his attention to the small details and his ability to keep track of the big picture, the computer would have never been so personal.  Even though I never met him, I am deeply saddened to know that one of the undisputed giants of our world is no longer with us to push us forward, to challenge our status quo and to light the fuel of our dreams.  It is now up to all or us who admired him so greatly to do his memory justice by following his extraordinary example by daring to dream bigger and above all, to think different.  My condolences to those who knew him and most of all his family.
It is hard to say goodbye.  You have been so much part of my family  since 1985; it was to your IPOD classic that I returned every evening  after a patrol in Baghdad and Afghanistan that allowed me to put away  the horrors of the day. Just knowing that you were amongst us, made Christmas so special and  very exciting. God Bless you and your entire Family.
 Dear Mr Jobs ,   I'm writing this letter because i have to thank you about all the work you made and all the lessons you left us behind.You left us a legacy of tecnology and wisdom.You've done  the most perfect work I've ever seen. I hope you are ok wherever you are ......                                                                    I love the work you do.
My condolences to the family, both personal and corporate...  First of all I just want to say that I WISH I could've met him... he's definitely one of a kind. This world lost an AMAZING, AMAZING innovator and role model for the future....but I know that his legacy will live on forever and surely be in every school textbook!   I thank him for living in my time...and for having changed my life and improving the human lifestyle! &nbsp;
To a man who always looked at the world in a way that only he could.  My  condolences to the family for such an unfortunate loss and to all those  who knew the man.  I was not fortunate enough to meet Mr. Jobs but I  have always respected him as a man who got to where he was not by  stepping on the little man but by working side by side and listening to  them all.  Thanks for showing the world what is possible with hard work  and determination.    
To all of you Family, friends, and co-workers of Mr. Steve Jobs. I never  get to meet you personally but, when I use apple products I will think  of you forever. With respect.&nbsp;
 A sad day for the world of technology, Steve Jobs really was an incredible man who changed the world we live in probably more then any other modern person. Will there ever be another steve jobs? probably not but i hope so.. RIP SJ. your legacy will live on forever.
From our family to Jobs family: sorry for your loss and sorry for the  loss of  a very creative, visionary here in silicon valley. We shall  fondly remember all the conveniences and fun all the apple products have  come our way and touched our lives!&nbsp;
This small message from an inhabitant of a small country is just to send my most sincere condolences to the entire Apple community. Today we lost one of the greatest persons in the entire world. One that always was thinking different. One that did a difference in this world. Admired by both, fans and detractors of Apple. We will not see another genius of Steve's magnitude in a long time. He was one the people that I most admired, and today's news about his passing where a real shock to me. Rest in Peace, Steve. Que descanses en Paz, Steve.&nbsp;
I am 6 years old and I love Steve Jobs and everything Apple.&nbsp;
Steve was not just Apple CEO for me. Steve was my passion steve was my role model steve was my life! I'm not that kind of person who just cry and always spread his feeling but that was a shock for me!  Steve was smart and ambitious,  he was all the great things in one person! I've seen every conference he present, every interview and video for him. Words cannot describe my feeling. Tears cannot show how sad I'm. all want I can say Thank You Steve Jobs. Your ideas and product changed the world ! but you changed me! Thank you Steve Jobs. R.I.P.
As I send this from my iPad, I salute you Steve Jobs for your ingenuity and vision.  I enjoy it every time I use my iPad and my iMac--fantastic machines!&nbsp;
The world has lost a great thinker, inventer, and innovator; this mans ideas changed the world we know today, and laid the technological foundation for tommorow. RIP, STEVE JOBS.
As a woman who took a chance last year and became an entrepreneur  (successfully!), Steve Jobs has been nothing short of an inspiration. He  exemplifies the best of human daring, ingenuity, passion and respect.  Hopefully it will be awhile before I go to heaven, but by the time I get  there I fully expect Steve will have discovered how to make my iPhone  work up there. Godspeed.
REST IN PEACE YOU'RE IN A BETTER PLACE NOW, WE WILL ALL MISS YOU AND HAVE  YOU IN OUR MEMORIES.
The brighter the flame, the quicker the oil burns out. Steve Jobs has created a world where people interact physically and  emotionally with their technology. Technology is no longer part of life, it's a way of life. His passion, enthusiasm, and ability to walk the walk as well as talk  the talk are invaluable. R.I.P Steve.
You have been visionary in the way we think today. Thanks for making our  lives so wonderful.... You will be missed and my deepest condolence to Steve's family.&nbsp;
 Dear Steve, Thank you for contributing to human kind, to making our lives so simple. You have indeed been a legend and you will be remembered forever. I respect you Steve! you are one in a million! thanks to you, I am able to write this e-mail so simply. Thanks to you, my ipod mini, nano, nano2, itouch and my macbook pro has been there for me on a daily basis. I hope heaven stores a place for you! we all pray for you! - Tonight, i will mark your initials SJ in all my apple devices.  Goodbye Steve&nbsp;
Steve was one of those few individuals who understood that for technology to proliferate and truly become part of our lives, it needs to be intuitive as well as functional. His contributions to the technology industry aren't those of technical impact, but of rational impact. His school of thought will light the way for every significant consumer technological advance for the next century. As long as those who dare to dream what technology can do for us keep dreaming, and as long as creativity continues to merge sharply with a strict standard of quality, Mr. Jobs' legacy will remain alive. 
 Thanks to the person who help me to think always different and in some way make me the way I am today, farewell!!&nbsp;
To those who love Mr. Jobs,   I just wanted to send my heartfelt condolences to you for your loss.  I also want to thank Mr. Jobs for all that he has done to change our world.  I am a seventh grade social studies teacher, and I just told my students about him last week, as entrepreneurship is one of the ideas we discuss, and I simply could not think of a better example of an entrepreneur.  I must say that if I have learned anything from the life of Mr. Jobs, it is that you can change the world, no matter what your area of expertise.  Thanks for allowing us to participate in iLife.  Mr. Jobs, you will truly be missed.
you changed the world, you changed it forever. you did something millions of people try to do every day, but no one has the drive, determination for changing it like you did, therefore you were able to succeed. incredibly sad day for the world, words can explain the saddness that just took over my body when i found out the news. you are amazing, and you will be forever missed and never forgotten. ever. r.i.p.
a very sad day for the world. 
The man is irreplaceable and his work has changed the way we live our daily lives. He wasn't selfish, egocentric, or closed minded. Money was never a goal for him and that alone was what crafted him into the inventor we know so well today. Steven P. Jobs, we never met but I, and those who surround me, have always felt a personal bond to you. Everyday we pick up your products to listen to music or call our parents. You've truly done what no other has and that is to affect everyone in the world by simplifying the complex. Your physical being may no longer be with us but your legacy and innovations will last us a millenium, and your teachings will last us all a lifetime. You are the visionary in the black turtleneck that was, is, and always will be my role-model.
Steve,  You have reached millions of people through your ingenuity and courage. I hope you will live forever in heaven and that your spirit will live long in those who followed you. Rest in peace.
My most sincere condolences to those near Steve. I know this news has left  a mark on many many people but the world knows how much this man has contributed to where we are today. During the years I actually have heard people  say "no, you can't wear snickers to the event, you aren't Steve Jobs" and I  think this sums it up. I hope his legacy is continued on in his honour and  wish we soon win the battle against cancer so that it stops taking people.  I wish Steve passed away a proud man and I send all my support to his closest people. We and I have lost a genius.
We have lost a true great. A daily inspiration for business for technology and for life.  With sadness and great respect.....&nbsp;
Thank you my good old friend. You have inspired me and will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life. I will dedicate all my creative work efforts and my work ethics to you. My thoughts are with you and your family.   Thank you.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  It is a sad day for computer history and humanity. You were such an inspiration to me.  Thank you!
Was so saddened to hear about our loss of Steve Jobs. He truly left his mark  on this world as has changed the whole direction of how we use our phones, computers and tablets.  You will be missed, and always remembered.
 Big loss for the whole world! We passed away, but is more alive than never! How many millions of people carry Steve Jobs? He will be alive until his masterpieces last. All my thoughts are with his family!&nbsp;
Gran hombre en verdad que hizo cambiar el modo de vida del mundo, es una lamentable perdida realmente estoy impactado con la noticia.     Realmente nunca se olvidara la aportación que hizo Steve Jobs al mundo.     Mis más sentido pésame a toda la familia Apple.&nbsp;
Thanks God for this life. A light amoung us. A man to follow in the good way. An Empire creator. His ideas changes the world, the way we live and interact. Source of employment and sustentation for many families.  Father of Generations, of Inspiration, of Imagination.  Good bye big man, God Bless You. 
Our heartfelt condolences to the Jobs family.   May his legendary vision continue to inspire everybody at Apple.   
Condolence to his family! He has truly change the world of technology! We will miss him! &nbsp;
 It's amazing how the passing of someone you never even met can  impact you so greatly. I have been using Apple products for half my  life, and somehow I could always feel the passion of the man behind the  products. I feel it even now as I type this email on my MacBook. We have lost a true visionary, and someone that I will forever  admire deeply. It's strange how people pass so suddenly, and that even  one of the wealthiest men alive couldn't escape death's cold grasp. The  passing of anyone influential in your life reminds you of your own  mortality, and that is probably the saddest part of Steve's passing.   The world will go on, and we will all learn to accept the final  curtain call of an icon. His legacy will live on, and his products will  speak for themselves, as they always have. Still, the day seems a little  less bright knowing that he is no longer with us.  Rest In Paradise Steve Jobs.
We need not only remember Mr. Jobs, but thank him for for bringing the world together in a way that only he could. We all love his products and how he personally went about dlivering them. My sincere condololences to his immediate family. I and the world will miss him dearly.
I am deeply and truly sorry for sorry those who knew and loved Mr. Jobs.  Although I can not speak about the man personally for we have never met but I will say, Steve Jobs had a gift.  A truly rare and special gift that only the immortals have.  It can't be explained and words do not do it justice.  It seems he "felt" it the way Beethoven did even before the first note, he just "knew" it they way Henry Ford did even before the first Model T left the assembly line, he just "saw" it the way Michael Angelo did even before the first brush stroke.    No one could look into their minds and see what they saw or feel the instincts they felt.  Steve took his lumps just as the rest of the immortals did but through it all he left a mark on this world of immeasurable size, one that we can not even fathom today but we will in the decades to come.  Rest easy Mr. Jobs, your pain is no more but your spirit lives on in so many.
 Steve is a true visionary who truly affected the way my family and I communicate and live our day to day lives. His passing will surely leave a bite in the world. Much like his Apple logo. Rest in peace Steven!&nbsp;
Hi, I'm Chris from Cleveland, Ohio. I'm 22 years old and I remember the first Apple product I ever bought, it was a 2nd Generation 4GB iPod Nano. I bought it at Circuit City right around my 17th birthday and I remember that when I plugged it into my PC for the first time I thought to myself: "Wow this is easy to use". I also remember the first time I saw an iMac. I was in a library and I was so confused because I was looking for a tower to turn it on the entire time not knowing that everything was in the display itself, I wasn't very familiar with Apple and the Mac at the time as you can see. Later I went on to buy an iPhone, Macbook Pro and an iPad, all of which I still own today and they are products that I absolutely love! I will always remember your iconic black turtle neck, blue jeans, white sneakers and Keynote presentations.  Thank you Steve Jobs for your incredible vision that changed the world, for surrounding yourself with a team of people that are truly passionate about the products that they are designing and for making devices that don't just have the latest and greatest specs but also touch the lives of the people who use them like they've touched mine.        Thank You
Genius. As well as Ayrton Senna, Michael Jordan, Michael Jackson, Leonardo Da Vinci, Charlie Chaplin and others that had perhaps marked its time. Never more we will see another Steve Jobs. Of the Apple that started in a garage to the icon world-wide known, Steve leaves a legacy that revolutionized the world of the technology.
A great man!   Much strength for those who are close!  A big Apple fan!&nbsp;
Brilliant thoughts and ideas, the courage to always give our best, we lost and will always miss you steve. 
We will carry on your message and will stay hungry and will stay foolish. We   love you and always will!  Thank you! 
Steve Jobs was the most innovative, creative and disruptive business leader since Graham Bell and Henry Ford. He made the world better. This time it's true: he will be missed.
This isn't just a celebrity losing his battle. This is an inspiration leaving us. Steve your products helped my special need daughter to talk and read. I will miss you. The days will be darker without you.&nbsp;
The brighter the star, the shorter the life..... Steve Jobs was an  EXTREMELY bright star.  To say he was a genius would be a HUGE under  statement.  I did not know him personally, and yet was deeply saddened  to learn of his passing.  The world has lost a beautiful soul and  creative genius.  I feel fortunate to have lived during his time. Thank you Steve Jobs for all you have given us.... you changed the way  the world runs.
Thanks Steve for make my life better and better. Thanks Steve for change my life completely. Thanks Steve for the iPad, iPhone, iPod, MacBook and iMac.  Rest In Peace, Steve.&nbsp;
We were very sad when we heard that steve passed away. Our condolences  to his family, friends and coworkers. <br>
Steve was a true inspiration to all of us that have been in IT and a genius that will be remembered for a very long time.     He was a very rare and brilliant man.
May he rest in peace! Big loss for all of us Apple family (users and makers), may the Lord bless his family and guide them forever.  Our deepest condolences.
Thank you Steve Jobs for bringing joy, happiness and productivity to all of  our lives.  Joy and Happiness from the experience in the use of the products you created and Productivity from the ease of use of those products you  created.  You changed the way the world enjoys and experiences music and computers.&nbsp;
Condolence! It's a very sad day for all of us. Requiescat in pacem!&nbsp;
  We have lost an old friend.  He not only thought up insanely great   ideas...... Steve made them happen. He earned my respect from my first look at the "Lisa" to the ipad.&nbsp;
I met Steve Jobs once in 1989 at The Ohio State University with NeXT computer.  I still remember the cube shape, the optical drive, and the gray scale 17" monitor.  Fascinated, I asked him "What is that slot for?".  He responded "We're not sure yet...it's for the future".
Steve Jobs,  You came back to Apple the year I was born and I've loved you and your devices ever since!!! You will truly be missed! Not only are all my gadgets Apple but I'm also working as an ACTC and striving towards an ACSA. I am sad and wish your family all my best during this hard time. May you watch over us from the iCloud as we remember you always!  You were a crazy one, you changed the world!&nbsp;
I know I'm just a teenager, I don't really know any way to express how much gratitude I have towards Steve. All I know is that there are so many remarkable things in his life, and almost everyone in the world has benefited from his outrageous miracles we rely on everyday. No one can be anywhere near as great as  he was, and in a way he is lived on by the millions of products, employees,  and "fanboys" that are around the world. I don't consider him dead, he is watching from afar, smiling at his wonderful ideas he leaves behind.
Steve Jobs is somebody who will continue to inspire me and my work,  thank you for being so awesome! 
Dear Steve,  Thank you for changing the world. The one you've left behind is far better because of you. My life will forever be better because you've touched it.
I am very sad about the message that Steve passed away.  He made our life easier with our Apple equipement.  We will never forget him. <br>
Dear Apple,                         You have lost a huge part of your company. I hope you keep advanceing in tech; without your true leader.                                I’m just 11 and I will miss him. 
What a remarkable man.  The world has lost a great one but the afterlife has gained a visionary.  May his legend live on for eternity. 
My deepest condolences to Steve's family, friends, and co-workers.  The shared-purpose of his vision created a company much larger than the sum of the parts.  You are in my thoughts and prayers now in this time of loss and sadness.&nbsp;
I cannot begin to say how I feel about Steve Jobs' loss.  He was always  an inspiration and a great person to look up to.  My thoughts are with his family and friends.  Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
This was a great man, who legacy will be with mankind forever. He  changed the world around us, and for that reason, the world without him  will never be the same.  RIP Steve.
I can't write in English. But to convey this feeling.  Thanks to the Macintosh. And very very Thanks to Steve  I glad to meet you.
Dear Apple, I would like to send my condolence to the loss of Steve Jobs. He is such great visionary person who changed the world of technology. Moreover, what he did inspired tons of people around this globe. We didn't just only think about what the least thing we can do but what is the biggest thing we can invent wherever is our position.  Steve Jobs will never be forgotten. His spirit will forever be with us.  Please keep trying to do the best thing for this world as Jobs used to be. God bless you.
 I'm so saddened to hear the news of Steve's passing. His revolutionary designs and innovative products have changed the world for the better. Without the iPad, I would not be able to Facetime my parents in the UK on a daily basis. So simple are his products that even my parents in their 60s have learned  to use them. &nbsp;You will always be remembered and never replaced. &nbsp;May you rest in peace.
Thanks for all you have given this world! My condolences to the entire   Jobs family and also I share this sentiment for his colleagues at Apple!  RIP  STEVE!  
My deepest condolences goes to Steve's family and loved ones, i have  been a apple user for a short period of time, but i love the products  that Steve pioneered,  and the service that the company he built provide  when using them, he succeeded  in building a company  that cares about  making a product that has made all of our lives much easier and richer. 
 REST IN PEACE&nbsp;
My thoughts and prayer are with you all tonight.  The company Steve started has touched the lives of many in this world and he will be missed.  I know he will live on in spirit, through the lives of all who knew him well.  As a sign of respect for Steve, I will be turning my IPhone, IPod, and IPad off for one hour.  May Steve rest in peace.           
Dear Apple Family,  We are all deeply saddened by Steve's passing. He will be very sorely missed. But we know that his flame burn on, at the core of Apple.&nbsp;
STEVE THANKS FOR EVERYTHING!!!!!!!! 
Dear Steve's family, dear Apple company  I can't find words how to describe my feelings... For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, I've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve.  I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius.
Never got a chance to thank you for every thing you have done for all of us. Your thoughts are an inspiration and your legacy shall be followed. Now is time for you to rest in peace.&nbsp;
Dear Apple  I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs, the great leader and creator in the world.I believe he would go to a more beautiful place and he would like to see a stronger Apple. We will remember him forever.
A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.
What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've  written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published),  almost every email I've ever written, has been written on machines  created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before  I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek  future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able  to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your  amazing work.
As I heard this sad news via my iPhone I am emailing my condolences from  my MacBook Pro.  Steve has left a fingerprint on our culture that cannot  be rivaled and will be long lasting. My deepest sympathy to his family  and friends. 
I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep getting the iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make Apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and I will never forget him. &nbsp; &nbsp;
so sorry to hear, so young, rip. long live the apple. 
Steve,  You have inspired me to live and die creatively and with passion.  We  may not have even known each other, but your time here has impacted  mine.  May you Rest In Peace.
steve, you changed my world for the better.. and that's more than I can say for any other stranger. 
Tonight our family prayed for your family &amp; loved ones.  Thanks for your life, Steve.&nbsp;
He was a genius for all humanity.  His passing away is a great loss for the civilization.     Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;
Oh boy, do I remember my first Macintosh computer! What absolute brilliance!  I will miss Steve Jobs' innovative style and flair. There will never be another CEO quite like him.  Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.
In reference at Steve's passing, I just want to show my respect for all the Apple community.  I think that Steve left behind a big legacy of sharing, innovation and love that must carry on.  Sorry if my english is not the best, I'm from Argentina and I'm deeply touched by his death.  From here, my condolences to all and Steve's family.  Bye Steve, we gonna miss you.&nbsp;
I'm very sorry for your loss and I wish he was still alive, he was the  best of the best in technological world he'll be missed.
Thank you Jobs, you truly were a hero of my life. 
The world lost a big talent, a visionary and a great artist. Every  enthusiast of technology will remember the big contribution of the  computer and technology industry. Only one word can define this  guy..."an artist"...goodbye Steve.&nbsp;
Words cannot describe what the world has lost today. Even though he is  not here in physical form his ideas and beliefs will continue to inspire  throughout history.  A true legend. &nbsp;RIP.&nbsp;
He is the only one light in the dark night. RIP.
I am Brazilian and just learned that Steve Jobs left us. The world is sorry!   My condolences for the family.  R.I.P. Steve Jobs.
   You are so great!   
I remembered when I first got my iPhone in 2007. The day I got it I went home and was so excited that I got a phone like this. That day I didn't realize  that apple would be my life. Every time a new item came out, I would have to watch the keynote and then buy it. I was one of the people who had to have  every item by apple. Steve jobs was my hero and my dream was to one day meet him in person. I can't believe that the greatest CEO in the world has passed the day after the new iPhone has came out. Not only with apple but with pixar to. He is probably one of the greatest if not the greatest roll models for a 14 year old like me, who is so into apple and everything like computers  and technology. Steve jobs will be dearly missed and I hope that the company lives on to build on greater and greater technology.
As an educator, I can attest to the countless lives that Steve Jobs has  touched and will continue to impact for generations.  He has been an  inspiration to children of poverty and has helped to make science "cool"  again.  It's amazing how we can take technology for granted.  Apple  products are different-they refuse to be ignored and inspire creativity,  collaboration and innovation.  Hats off to you, Steve, and everyone else  at Apple.  May you continue to ding the universe!  RIP 
Truly terrible news about Steve Jobs passing away. I realize that I  never knew him but the truth is that his products he and his team have  created have given me all the amazing opportunities in my life. They  allowed me to express myself and my creativity along with millions of  others. You will be missed Mr. Jobs!
 My thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family and everyone at Apple.  What  an extraordinary Person he was.  Thanks for all the great and innovative products.
Dear Apple,  I would like to send my condolence to the Jobs Family that he will always be remembered in history for is great and awesome innovation!   Thank you Steve for all the wonderful products that you have created through which totally revolutionize the IT industry.
I will always be thankful for the wonderful imagination and innovation of Steve Jobs. My childhood would have not been the same without a macintosh computer in my home, and it is amazing to see how apple has become such a part of my day to day life even today. Thank you Steve for all of your creativity and the amazing work you have accomplished.
In his memory. May all men be like him! Rest in peace :(
Tribute to the man who changed the mobile computing forever. Modern World Owes You. Thanks Steve :)
I am deeply saddened to hear of the loss of Steve Jobs.  His persistence of vision repeatedly fought the status quo to open new horizons.  He will be remembered as a great man by the millions touched by the fruits of his foresight.&nbsp;
"This was a great man, a man of visions an guts". A great person that words are unable to describe. He was devoted to his works and his products are full of arts and harmony... may he rest in peace. 
  Dear Steve,   Sometime in the mid-80's I stood in your greatness, listening to you speak with the CEO of Enable Software at a tradeshow in Washington DC.  I didn't say a word, as I was a young thing standing in the presence of a computer rock-star.  There you were, the stuff of legends... I thought you stunning in your Italian suit.    But, my admiration for you had begun long before this chance passing... with the Apple 2E and the Lisa.  The first computer I owned was a 128k mac which was upgraded to a fat mac and finally to a mac plus.  I sold computers out of a small retailer in Kingston NY. Three decades have passed and I have owned more Macs than I have cars.  Thirteen to be precise... that number does not include a multitude of iPod, iPad and iPhones.  To say I am an admirer of your work is an understatement.  You ARE the Einstein of our generation, of my lifetime.    Thank you.  I am, and foreever will be a Mac.... may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
I never met the man but he changed my world and so...my life. Being able  to travel with a reliable computer while listening to the songs I wanted  when and where I wanted them....those simple conveniences allowed me to  stay in the air more time than it should have. He's exactly my age but  that's not why Steve's passing pains me. The world moves on and we move  with it. His legacy will run a long long time.&nbsp;
Just wanted to say what a great loss, Steve was a visionary. I started using apple computers back in the early nineties, and never looked back. The logic which Steve incorporated into his designs made the computer much more than a cold steel box, it gave it life, to interact with the user in a way that would enhance and not hinder. God bless you Steve, our hearts are saddened with your passing. The world has been forever changed by you and forever at a loss without you. RIP Steve Jobs.
I have been an "Apple girl" since my very first computer and I always   will be. I feel like I have lost a family member. Rest in peace Steve,   we will all keep Apple alive.&nbsp;
I'm so sorry for your loss, for our loss.  
I never met Steve but he changed the way I feel about computers and  electronics.  I mourn him may he rest in peace.  I think of his family,  at home, and the universal family he built with his wonderful  personality and his amazing creativity.  Thank you Steve for all you did  for us.  I know you will guide, from heavens,  those manufacturing your  beloved Apple products, you will always live with us, every time we  open our Macs, make a phone call, use a iPad, or any other Apple  product.  Rest in peace dear Steve.&nbsp;
You were a bright icon in my life since I was a kid. You inspired me. I will miss you.&nbsp;
Words would not do justice to the immeasurable contributions Steve has made to the world, right down to my world as his revoluntionary products has brought so much joy and improvements into my life.  Thank you Steve for being the brillant man that you were, and though the great loss that is felt this moment may linger and fade with time, but your tech brillance will last through the ages.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. You have renewed our faith in technical quality. The company with the superior product should be at the top. The tech world seems correct now, thanks to you.&nbsp; 
Steve has been an incredible inspiration for so many people, including  myself. I grew up in the IT industry hearing about Steve's exploits.  Apple isn't just about technology; its an experience! I wish to express my deepest sympathies and condolences to his family  for their lost. My prayers are with you all. God Bless!
To the Jobs family , My family sends it's deepest condolences, Mr.   Jobs was my generations Thomas Edison.  I am glad to have had the   opportunity to be part of his great success, not only as a business   persona, but also as a human being trying to make the world better   place for all of us.  Thank you.
While watching our friends' oldest son - 5 yrs old - as they welcomed their 4th child to the world this past June, the father used his iPhone 4 to FaceTime my MacBook Pro so he could introduce his eldest son to his youngest. It was a moment I got to host in my home, and it was possible because of the innovations and leadership of Steve Jobs.  Thank you, Steve.&nbsp;
As a web developer in his 40's I cannot thank Steve Jobs enough for all  that he has done for my life.  I don't even know where to start.  If  those of us who are left behind are able to focus and harness our own  visions like Steve did for us - we would be a much better world!&nbsp;
My sympathy to Steve Job's family, the world loses a great man, a model for humanity.  I am so sorry.&nbsp;
I am only twelve years old but I am aware who Steve was.  He created an  awesome company and I am typing on a mac computer as I speak. (It is  awesome by the way.) R.I.P Steve 
Thank you, Mr. Jobs. You changed everything. 
To a man that said he could change the world with his square peg in a  round hole idea... you will be greatly missed...  
Steve I just wanted to thank you for everything!  Everything you've done has inspired me to become a person more like you. You will truly be missed! "Stay hungry, stay foolish."
He was a very important person for mankind. He brought on such huge advancements in technology that he changed the way we live and do things. I know he worked until the very end.  Thank you. 
Walt Whitman expresses so much in O Captain! My Captain!  Thank you for guiding our ship. 
I am writing this email on my MacBook, and am still in shock at having  just read the news. I am so sorry to hear of the family's loss, of  Steve's loss, and the world's. That he was a visionary innovator is no  doubt; but beyond that, Steve is a human being, with a family, with  close friends, desires, passions, dreams and hopes. I can imagine the  pain his loved ones are experiencing and can only offer my sincerest  condolences at this extremely difficult time. Here's to remembering  Steve Jobs.
My heart sank and my tears fell when I read the news. Nobody lives forever but I never wanted this day to come, especially not so soon. He was one of the greatest innovators and inventors history has ever known. All his creations were the lightbulbs of our lives. People just see Apple as a company, a ticker symbol on the NASDAQ. But Apple under Steve was our guiding light; he changed the way we live, the way we work, the way we socialize.  John Nash had a recommendation letter from his professor that contained only 5 words: "This man is a genius." I can only say the same for the one and only Steve Jobs.  Rest in peace; you will be dearly remembered and sorely missed.   Yours truly, Proud Apple Fangirl  --  "All the forces in the world are not so powerful as an idea whose time has come."  -  Victor Hugo 
My first computer Apple IIPlus.  Oh how life has changed. &nbsp;Good bye Steve.  RIP.
Though I am only 12 years old, I am old enough to know what an impact Mr. Jobs had on the world. His genius products and general association with customers made him who he was. He will be missed.
We've always been inspired by the creations, innovations and development that Apple has done through the years. Steve Jobs was the inspiration of that innovation, leadership and visionary person that any one of us wants to be.  It's been a incredible ride through all this years by having such an iconic person that lead us into a better future.  We are praying for his soul and his family and want to extend our most sensible condolences to all of you for such a terrible loss.
Today we all lost a visionary.  Today I lost someone I never got a chance to thank for such wonderful, life-changing products that have thoroughly enriched my life.  Thank you Steve.   
He&nbsp;was a great person,&nbsp;had great ideas,&nbsp;gave great speeches,&nbsp;moved a lot of people,&nbsp;made a difference and&nbsp;changed the world. My sincere condolences to his wife and&nbsp;children.&nbsp;
 I remenber you and many "one more things" from you.&nbsp;
Steve will always be an inspiration to me and the millions of people in  this world. I've never seen someone so passionate and with such an  incredible vision for the future. I will greatly miss him and never  forget how he's changed my life.
Apple Community, Beloved Steve I couldn't believe that Steve has left. This is a terrible day, the worst  day in Apple's history, a terrible day for the industry and filled of sorrow of your customers. Steve was and will be remembered as the most charismatic CEO in Apple's history, the only man whose vision and dreaming could create a trillion dollar company. There's no company with more identity  than Apple, there's no company able to set the standard, to suddenly change it all. Think different as Steve says became a life motto for people all over the world and I, as a college student, I'm lucky to have lived to  see this man, humble and hardworking, take the stage at Infinite Loop, with  his turtleneck sweater and faded jeans, shaking the thoughts of the world.&nbsp;
 Thank you for forever changing the computer as we know it and making our lives much better with the products you created :-)
I don't want to be redundant and repeat how great he was as an innovator and how he was a visionary. I prefer to think of the impact he had on so many lives, and the reactions to his passing bear that out. So many people that are so sad that it's more like losing a friend than an employer or pioneer of technology. It's similar to when John Lennon passed, those of us who love Apple just like we love the Beatles. We don't know the people personally, but what they brought to our lives means so much that we feel true sadness when we lose them. 
Dear Steve,   Thank you for making this world better. You saved us all.   We will miss you.&nbsp;
Certainly the world has lost a great person and a genius. &nbsp;Rest In Peace.
A great person. We will remember Steve Jobs in our heart forever. The influence brought by him can not be replaced. Bless and cheer up, apple staff. We expect wonders from apple again and again.
Apple Team:     Please continue to do the great things you have been doing!&nbsp;
Today is a sad day. The world has lost a great visionary, a company and its employees have lost a leader, and a family has lost a husband and father. Although we never met, I feel like Steve Jobs was my friend. I think that I watched every press conference and model launch since they were first published online, I have long been a champion for the company, and had hoped, like so many, for Steve's good health. I have been an Apple fan and device owner for 25 years; my first computer, in 1986 at the age of 9, was an Apple Macintosh and I currently have at least eight Apple devices that I use daily or almost daily. As a shareholder I have followed very closely and admired the company that Steve built; where doing the right thing and building the product the right way was more important than the current quarter's earnings report. Companies could learn much from Steve and Apple's example.  Thank you, Steve, for all you have done and for your example. I will miss you. 
Dear Apple Stuff,  Steve Jobs was a wonderful man, a genius, truly rich, not because of money, but because of his spirit and wisdom. His speech at Stanford was so remarkable, I would never forget his words. He truly loved what he was doing and taught us to do that. So please, don't sell yourself for self-esteem. Remember his words "The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is a great work and the only way to do great work is to love what you do". Dots connect down the road. Let Apple still breathe with Steve's spirit. STAY HUNGRY, STAY FOOLISH.  R.I.P Steve Jobs 
 Steve Jobs was a visionary and an ICON of brilliance and a figurehead of the truest entrepreneurial spirit in the world today.  He had a knack to see forward into time, and, by virtue of intelligence, creativeness or sometimes just by pure willpower, shaped the world as we know it, shaped the future as we will come to know it; sadly without him. &nbsp;You will be sorely missed.               
Steve, you have been a man who I have looked up too for a great part of my short life. Your products and ideas have influenced me greatly and provided me with incredible opportunities that I would never have gotten if it weren't for you. Above all, you have inspired me to strive to be as creative as possible. Thinking of your loss makes me sad, because not only have I lost a role model, but the world has lost a pioneer, a creative, an inventor, a genius.I may never have met you Mr. Jobs, but I'll miss you. RIP.
I must express my deep sadness at the death of this irreplaceable intellect whose creative genius touched everyone and changed the world. I may never have met him, but I've known him since that unforgettable, mind blowing, life changing day back in 1984 when I opened my first Apple box and set up that Mac on my desktop. Transcending the material reality of the machine, it became a priceless gift to my imagination. How could one not love the bearer, however remote, of such a gift? I will greatly mourn this insanely great man. 
 The only feelings that cross my mind is SAD when I getting the news of Steve Jobs had passed away. Your contribution to Apple, technology and even the world will always be remembered by us. I am proud to be one of the iPhone 4 user which maybe the last piece of your creation in Apple.You have actually done a great job to technology. I will keep supporting Apple and R.I.P Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve gave us not only APPLE but also a different world we had never imagined. We will always miss you.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve, you inspired the world. 
One Of the most important  persons Of all times!! humanity owes him a lot!! Today is a sad day!! Condolences from Mexico City.&nbsp;
Just a normal guy who feels saddened by the loss of one of my generation's visionaries, Steve Jobs.  Although I'm not a die-hard Apple fan I have always found favor in the innovations that Apple has come up with, and in knowing that Steve was always up to his feet thinking of new ways to amaze the world.  Apple as a company under Steve's helm did not just become one of the world's leading companies, but has impacted the lives of many in the field of computing and media.  I hope that he left this world knowing that as a person he has inspired countless people through his leadership of Apple.     My condolences to his wife and children.  He will surely be missed.
The world has lost a true legend. You have changed so many lives. RIP Steve. 
I pray that he made peace with the Creator who blessed him with such talent and vision.  America was great because it encouraged men like him instead of marching to stop against them.  Carry on with his great vision. I pray for his family, friends and those fortunate enough to work with this genius.  May the peace that surpasses understanding be with all that loved him.&nbsp;
I don't know what to say. God Bless Him. I am really sad.  
There is nothing I can say to ease his family and friend's sorrow, we all have lost a piece of ourselves today. God bless you all. Heaven just got upgraded.&nbsp;
I truly wish we had taken that photo last night when we thought of it. It would depict four long-time friends, aged mid-60s to early 80s, sitting together with our individual iPads as we shared apps, verified information, and laughed at YouTube videos. A fitting tribute to Steve, who touched both the young and the elder with his genius. We were happy to know him and will truly miss him, but will hold him in our memories as closely as we will our Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods. &nbsp;
  It is sad to think that a man who gave so much to so many has spent   such a short time making a different world for so many people. Perhaps   he is making a difference to so many more in his new life. Thank you   for all you gave to all of us.
I'm just among the millions that would like to say this: On behalf our family and the World, Mr. Jobs proved to Us, All, that a single dream can come true by our dedication, passion, energy well spent and the innovation to create gadgets that has and will continue to transform our world into a greater tomorrow.  My deepest condolences goes to his family, personal friends and to the entire Apple community.  His is an inspirer and admirer to us, May You REST In Peace!!! You are now among the other great thinkers in Heaven/ Tech World!!!&nbsp;
Good bye dear friend Steve Jobs&nbsp;
History will look back on this sad day when one of the greatest creative and technical minds in our lifetimes was lost.  He was our modern day equivalent to Leonardo Da Vinci, Sir Issac Newton, Albert Einstein, and the like.  He was a visionary that had the amazing ability to breath life into his ideas.  He believed so passionately in his work that his creativity became both seductive and infectious.  I loved that like any artist his work was never done and that he constantly challenged himself and his colleagues to grow.  He demanded nothing but the best and he delivered what he promised.  He leaves behind an awesome legacy, one that the world will not soon forget.  Our prayers and thoughts are with the Jobs and Apple families that he leaves behind.  Know Mr. Jobs that you will be missed.&nbsp;
Thank you Dear Steve for your simple humanity, kindness and your brilliantly innovative mind. May the Buddhas grant you gentle karma and a fortunate rebirth.   
The world has lost a great man. My thoughts and prayers are with Steve and his family.
Here in Brazil we are sorry for the loss, as Steve Jobs was a person who made a huge difference in the world we live in, strength to all of you.  I'm really sorry.&nbsp;
Steve and I may have never meet but certainly I must say that I feel this loss like if we knew each other. He certainly is a great inventor and we can all be assured that he has instilled his core values into his company so that we may continue to see Apple flourish.&nbsp;
You've changed the world with your foresight and vision. You've made computing a fun experience EVEN while doing work.   My condolences to your family on their loss. 
RIP Steve Jobs. We record our music on Macs. We sell most of our music on iTunes. My guess is most of our fans listen to us on Macs or iPods. And we interact with fans all over the world on Macs and iPhones. Pretty soon we'll probably shoot a new video using iPhones. Thank you Steve Jobs for not only creating phenomenally functional devices, but for making them so cool looking that we all feel like we're living 100 years in the future.
I will miss you, Steve. It is my honor that I could work for you at Apple Australia for few years. Thanks for making art and tech you invented and all new experience you gave me. Rest in Peace.
My greatest idol just passed. I've never been more inspired by anyone as  much as Steve. He has made the world a better place. My condolences to  his family, close friends and all the people at Apple. The world has  lost a remarkable human being and a true genius. &nbsp; "No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't wanna  die to get there." Stay hungry. Stay foolish, Steve. Rest in Peace. 
My condolences to Apple and the friends and family of Steve. He will be sorely missed by all those he has inspired over the years. 
I'm sitting here in the most remote city in  the world and yet feeling connected and part of whats going on - a lot  due in no small part to Steve and his vision. We have all lost a truly inspirational leader - a real one in a million. Thanks for everything Steve.
Thank you, Steve, for making the world a little more fun. 
I just want to let you know that I am in awe of this incredible man. He was an amazing human being and we are all in debt. Thank you and we all love you.
Thank you for letting me experience the genius of your innovations.&nbsp;
There are some people who, solely by being on this planet, have changed it profoundly. Steve Jobs is one of those individuals. Long live Apple Computer.&nbsp;
What you kickstarted in that garage with Woz has changed the world and profoundly affected the paths in life that many of us now follow. Your time was too short and you will be missed.
My life changed the day I was introduced to Apple, and now it has  changed again, If we had more people in this world like Steve Jobs, then  the world would be a better place. The whole world will morn the passing  of Steve today. My thought to his family and friends.&nbsp;
Thanks STEVE for all your Inspirations, Creativity, Guts, Lessons thoughts...      you still live in people's hearts and always will live he years to come.
Steve has left not just one, but two very important things which have made the world a better place to live. With Apple, he has given so many things, innovations, visions, and many more. With Pixar, he has added smiles, laughter, and memorable memories when we stepped out of the cinema. The world will surely miss you, Steve...but forget you we will not.
I cannot express my sadness with letters. Steve is my hero. I love you Steve Jobs.
Steve, Thank you for all that you have done for me and my family. My son has down syndrome,  leukemia, and is non verbal. It is your vision and the work of many dedicated Apple employees in creating products like, the iPad, which has allowed me to converse with my son. I could never repay you for allowing my son to press icons to converse with me. I can say thank you Apple.  I wish you well on your journey. I pray for your family's comfort.    Thank you Steve Jobs. Thank you for being you.&nbsp;
What you did should inspire everyone. Apple products was not only about business, it was passion.  You made us passionate about your products, your vision.  All Apple's fans are very sad and the humanity lost a great human being. Merci Steve. 
R.I.P. Steve Jobs. Thank you for your wonderful vision creating the  iPod, iPod Touch, iPhone, IPad &amp; Mac computers, (I love my Mac). &nbsp;
Steve Jobs - The man who changed everything. There is no part of our  world and our lives that Steve Jobs did not make a huge impact on. His  visions and inventions have changed the way we compute, listen to music,  take photos, communicate, experience and interact with the internet . .  . basically the way we live. His legacy will live forever and he will be missed very much. 
Mr. Jobs, Thank you for sharing your talent with the world. You will be missed but not forgotten.
A true visionary. A big loss for Apple, and our culture in general. My thoughts to his family and friends.
 Dear Steve, Thank you for the inspiration, the drive, the humour and everything else. Know that you have made a great difference in many people's lives.  Rest in Peace.
Steve Jobs, May You RIP. Your spirit may be gone, but it also lives with us in every piece of your innovation through generations.
I am sure many people feel the same way I do- shocked by the intense sadness this news brings and humbled by a sudden realization of the massive impact he and his genius have had on our daily lives.  He was truly a hero and legend of our generation and, of course, he will never be forgotten.  I send my deepest condolences to his family and friends and hope they can find some comfort in knowing that he was one in a billion who actually changed the world for the better! 
Tonight I go to sleep very sad. A wonderful man has been lost to a  terrible illness . Steve Jobs brought us such eye opening technology  that only great men like past visionaries, such as Galileo, and a more  modern day Henry Ford. Again, I don't know how to extend my thanks, to  a man that brought me out of the dark ages.   We Shall Forever Miss  You.  Thank You, God Bless You.  Rest in peace now.
Thank you Steve.  Our journey together started in 1981 and you have helped us educate so many.   You are one in a trillion.  Find peace, we love you and will miss you. "If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on." Steve Jobs 1955 - 2011 
Regardless of what he created, Steve Jobs was a visionary, a leader, and an inspiration. His creativity was only able to be expressed through his hard work and dedication to the dream that he created. He will be missed.&nbsp;
 He will be dearly missed by anyone who knows him or even know of him.            
Life and Death are not in our hands but the life between&nbsp;birth and&nbsp;death is indeed. Dear Steve the life you lived is truly inspirable. The world has a big loss of your presence.  &nbsp; Prayers.
Dear Apple, Thank you for making such an impact in the world through your amazing leadership, Steve Jobs!  He will be greatly missed for his outstanding qualities as an inspiring visionary and thought leader. God Bless.
To the family and friends of Steve, I am sending my deepest condolences.  You are all in my prayers.    Steve has left the world a better place, he was able to see and create   things that others were not able to do.  He had the courage to follow   his heart and his intuition.  That is his greatest gift to the world.    To believe in your ideas and your visions. Thank you for lighting the path.&nbsp;
As a customer, I thank Steve for the creativity that brought us the iPod.&nbsp; It has indeed revolutionized the way we listen to music today. As an investor, I thank Steve for reviving my retirement accounts. But most importantly, as a person, I ran into Steve once at Stanford Mall at the Sony Store of all places.&nbsp; He walked in in his jeans, black turtleneck, and running shoes.&nbsp; He had no entourage, bodyguards, or "people" with him.&nbsp; He was by himself, looking at the products. The CEO of a large company was just one of people, he blended in, and I think he liked that.&nbsp;  I am so sorry.&nbsp;  
The best way to say good bye is, giving you thanks... thanks for computer revolution, innovation. to teach us that is possible  if we want it! its a shame to loose you! this world needs more people like you. thank you for this path you leave... the path you lead... you will be always in our hearts... in our apples... in our souls! god bless you! 
The world is a better place because of Steve's innovative and entrapaneurship spirit, and he will sadly be missed.  All employees of Apple can be proud of their founder and the company he created, and should remain stewards of his legacy by keeping his dreams and spirit alive.   While there can only be one Steve Jobs, may the next visionary rise up and build on what Steve and his teams created, and continue to innovate solutions for the next generation. My thoughts and condolences go out to his wife and children, and for all those who knew him, and please know you were all blessed for personally knowing him.
Thank you for pushing the boundaries. You will be missed 
Just writing to send my condolences to his family. Steve Jobs was one of the biggest source of inspiration that affected my life ever. My condolences to his family.
You are my most inspiring leader! Hope I can serve Apple one day and may you rest in peace!&nbsp;
Never Forget you M. Jobs.
You have changed our world and we are thankful.  Rest in peace, fine man. 
 What an incredible loss for Apple, America and the world. Switched to  Apple a couple of years back, wow I have never looked back. Rest in  peace Mr Jobs! Thank you! 
Today in my high school economics class our teacher lectured on the achievements of Steve Jobs and Apple. It is such a coincidence that he passed away today when just a&nbsp; couple hours ago I was sitting in class learning about the visionary that was Mr. Jobs. I was inspired by his story and the innovation in everything he did.&nbsp; Out of curiosity, I decided to find more information about Mr. Jobs and found the news that he had passed away. I saw a quote from Mr. Jobs that asked "if this was the last day of my life, would I be doing what I’m doing?". It made me think about I'm doing now and what I'm going to do tomorrow. If today was really my last day I would not be sitting in an economics class or listening to a lecture. As for tomorrow, I truly wish that one day I can become an entrepreneur in the definition of an entrepreneur that Steve Jobs embodied.&nbsp; I would like to share my condolences to all those people who were near to Mr. Jobs. 
 I can't believe you have been taken away from us so soon. You are cherished and will be greatly missed. Thank you for all that you gave us!            
No one will be able to sport that black turtleneck like you could. You gave the world so many amazing technologies...one of which I am writing this condolence from. Apple will carry on the flame you have lighted. For now you rest  though. Maybe we'll all be sporting the latest Steve Jobs device in heaven one day. RIP Steve&nbsp;
He's truly a memorable person. I'm not an Apple fan but I admire him as he brought the world the most genius design. He'll continue his Apple empire in heaven. God bless him.
As a recent grad with a BS in Computer Engineering and a self-proclaimed nerd, I cannot put into words how much Mr. Jobs has impacted my life.  His innovations have changed day-to-day life as I know it.  His creativity and brilliance will be sorely missed.
The world has lost one of its brightest lights. &nbsp;Rest in peace Steve.
Thank you Steve. You taked my love to technology and multiplied by 1000.
My condolences to the Jobs family. &nbsp;Thank you and Mr. Jobs for such a positive impact in technology.  I was born  in 1980 and will always remember my first computer....the Apple 2c...and now, at 31 years old, my wife and I carry iPhones as do my 5 siblings and their spouses.  I have 2 iPads and a MacBook Pro.  I love the Apple family and again thank you for all the great years.
He  will live in our hearts forever. He will be remembered for all eternity. Our condolences to his family and his dear friends.&nbsp;
Dear Steve ... I've always had my respect and my esteem, ever since I joined your wonderful world. Only a genius like you could create it ... Big man. Thank you for all that you have created around us, inspiring you have been a mentor, an example not only for Apple but for everyone! Not that I can give myself a final farewell .. remembering your words .. Be hungry, be foolish ... I will be! Goodbye Steve.
 Steve was one of the best men in the world! No words to describe his death. I will always remember him as the guy who reinveted music, phone and web experience. RIP Steve.
On 02/26/07 I sent an email to a "made up" email address out of  frustration with an issue with a G5 computer under repair for over a  month at an Apple store.  I figured "sjobs" at Apple might be a Steve  Jobs email, so I sent it, figuring it would go off into space never to  be heard from again.  Well, to my amazement, the next afternoon I  received a call from a gentleman who said Steve read the email and  instructed him to take care of the situation.  And on that next day the  issue was resolved with a a new replacement MacPro.  I was up and  running again.  Steve read the email, had someone verify the issue, and  resolved it within 24 hours.  I can't tell you unless you experience  this for yourself, but this is the epitome of customer service, from the  TOP GUY down.  This kind of thing is rare to begin with, but from the  man who created the company himself to take a moment to resole the  issue, this is unheard of, and will never happen again with any other  company.  Steve stands alone as a one-of-a-kind.
I will always be in awe and Thankful to Steve for making life easier   for all of us "creative types". It isn't always easy being a "Right Brain Thinker" but I have always   said the Apple Computer was made for us visual and tactile Right Brain   Thinkers! Thank you Steve for helping all of us artists!  Your legacy will live   on!  You continue to make our lives more Colorful!&nbsp;
As I type on my 2007 MacBook, I reflect upon how Apple framed the way I learned "computers"; from the 80's desktop Macs with their colorful Apple, where I learned about geography from playing "Where in the World is Carmen Santiago" to my first iPod for my birthday in 2004, to never living without my iPhone now - Apple fundamentally changed the way we keep in touch with the world and how we interact with all different aspects of it.&nbsp; It's all due to the imagination of Steve Jobs.&nbsp; God Speed and may you enlighten Heaven as much you enlightened us here. My deepest sympathy to his colleagues at Apple and, most especially, his family. 
See ya Steve. Apple wont be the same without you. 
Always ahead in idea, inspiration, and  Invention.  Continue forward. You'll be missed.
We are very fortunate to have lived on a generation where Steve had innovated and reinvented mostly all the things that made this world a much better place to live in. Steve, you will be missed. And thank you. 
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs, You have impacted the world with your vision and influenced our lives in so many ways. You will be missed and hope your legacy will live on and continue to impact our generation for many years to come. &nbsp;
The Walt Disney of my generation has passed. Today is truly a sad day. My thoughts are with Steve's family and friends. 
He is the incredible person to bring us unbelievable masterpieces   named Apple.
Back in 2009, I signed up to attend macworld.  I did not have a single apple product nor was I familiar with any of them. I just wanted to be able to &nbsp;ttend an event where this guy, Steve Jobs, was going to speak.Today, due to budget constraints, the 1 Apple product I have is the IPhone. And yet, I still watch and read every apple news Mr. Jobs shares with the world. Steve Jobs was a visionary. And he enthralled me, a non-tech person, and made me believe that whatever the imagination can create, reality can to.
Steve Jobs has created such an impact in my life. He's given me work, provided me with amazing products, and has inspired me to pursue my career path. What a visionary man. Thank you for everything, Steve. You will certainly be missed.
I was never fortunate enough to meet Steve, but I admired him from the beginning. While I was not an Apple fanboy in the beginning, I became one. And it  was because he designed and delivered fun, different, exciting gadgets. He was a superb genius.  My thoughts and prayers tonight are with those who knew and loved him, his family, for their loss. I have lost my parents and I know the feeling. May God bring them peace that Steve is with God, talking about the iPhone 5 and iPad 3 plans he left behind for us all... &nbsp;
You've been my hero. Can't stop crying.&nbsp;
A senior citizen wishes to thank you Mr. Jobs...my IPad is my most favourite object ever....you were truly a visionary and may you rest in peace.....may your family find peace and joy and laughter in all the memories.....rest in peace and thank you for all you gave the world.&nbsp;
I have only used Apple computers my whole life, and I plan for it to stay that way. All my condolences go out to Steve's family and hope they are celebrating the life of one of the most extraordinary men of all time.&nbsp;
I'm writing this from my macbook, while syncronizing my iphone, and read  the news on my Ipad listening to my ipod nano while updating my appletv! Thank you Jobs for changing the boring ways we had to do the things we  wanted to do!  Thankx! 
Its very sad to hear the news that Steve Jobs is no more. I don't know him personally but he was one of the greatest man to me. He is the revolution in the field of technology. I express my deep condolences.&nbsp;
Of course I never new Steve Jobs personally but I think of him often  when I am using my iMac and iPhone.  These products have brought joy and  ease to my life.  I will remember him for these items, but know his  family will miss his presence and love.
Steve jobs was an amazing inventor. It is very sad that he passed away. That  is why when I heard Steve Jobs was dead I dashed out to my local Apple store and bought an iPod and sent this email on it. &nbsp;He will be missed.&nbsp;
I love my iMace. R.I.P Steve Jobs. I bet you were a wonderful man that  helped change the world and advance us in technology so great Windows  can never compare. Apple will never be the same without you. I send my  condolences to the family and hope they are okay while grieving for this  terrible loss to them and to the world.
I'll always remember how Steve came back from the ashes to revolutionize the way we think and play.
You never going to die in my heart. You have give me a million reasons  to live and I'm not going to forget that. I miss you Steve.
We are a small graphic design and illustration career school in Philadelphia - with students who are filled with talent, creativity, spirit - and a lot of heart. Just like Steve.  With sincere appreciation, to everyone at Apple, thank you!  And thank you Steve.&nbsp;
my condolences from Brazil. We've lost a genius
Steve was a master-mind, a true genius.  He will be greatly missed.  The  "apple" of our eyes! It is because of Steve Jobs that our technology has evolved during the  last 30 plus years thank you Steve for your technical contributions  and for being the wonderful man you were.&nbsp;
Dear Steve's family, and the Apple family, You brought us us so many cool product that enhanced our lives and  pushed technologies to the forefront. You have been an inspiration to  all of us entrepreneurs who have seen Apple almost failing to becoming  the most valuable company on the planet.  May you find peace wherever you are now. May your ideas live on and the  people you have inspired continue taking Apple to new heights.  A long time follower of Apple and fellow buddhist.
  Apple company,  I am very saddened because of the loss of the most creative man in the world. Mr. Jobs was different and had  a vision to make something awe-inspiring and magnificent.  He founded the Apple company and is one of the most smartest man in our time. Our world has lost a great human being today. However, instead of being saddened by the loss of Steve, we should remember him and keep his legacy alive forever. He will live on in our hearts not because of his potential to overcome other companies but for his greatest inventions and visions. Apple and the people will forever remember him and maybe one day he may re enter this world to make Apple and keep his past life's legacy alive. May he rest in peace.             
Dear Steve,  Thank you....your legend will forever echo throughout the ages and in our hearts.  Thank you for everything you have given this world.  Now go and make heaven a better place!  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
The world has lost a true modern genius. Thoughts and prayers are with his family. An Apple user since 1987
 I wish to offer my regards to Apple and the Jobs family. Steve Jobs opened a window to a broader  and deeper way to enrich our lives through technology. His influence in the arts, music, and design will always be remembered and appreciated. Thank you Steve Jobs!!!&nbsp;
I am a fairly new "apple baby". I got hooked with the iPhone and have  since gotten an iPad and an iMac. I love all these innovations and I  know that the vision behind their creation was ingenious. I am saddened  by this news. My deepest condolences to all the family, close friends  and colleagues. I pray that his legacy is continued in the spirit in  which Steve established it.  I love your essence Steve. I will remember you as I have your creations  around me. I thank God for letting us have you even for this brief  while. Rest In Peace. 
really a big lost, but he left a big legacy 
As a owner of 4 apple devices, I cannot express how saddened I am to hear about Steve's demise. He truly added some thing to our lives including my 3 year old daughter's, who spends hours everyday playing with iPad.  The world will miss you, Steve.&nbsp;
My condolences to Mr. Jobs'  family, both at home and at Apple. What an  inspiring man - such a tragedy the world had to lose him at such a young  age. 
Never knew ya Steve, but you seemed a very cool dude.  Thanks for your spirit! &nbsp;
Steve jobs is my inspiration. My idol. He changed things. He changed the way  that we live. As soon as I found out the his news, I don't even know what to  say. Although he passed away, he will always be remember as hero. At least, as my hero.
It has always been an honor to use products that were made with passion  and vision and dare I say love. It is amazing to live in a time when so many things are possible. Steve  Jobs and company took the possibilities and turned it into magic. Most of all, I am sorry for the family of Mr. Jobs. I don't care if you  created Apple or harvest them for pennies an hour. Losing a family  member in the prime of life is painful. Thank you for everything Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
Thank you Sir Steve for making a new world for us. you will be remembered in our hearts... the master innovator.
Ever since i got my first iMac, i knew that Apple was a special company.   Thank you Steve Jobs for creating the most exciting technology out  there and revolutionizing the whole tech industry.  You will be truly missed. 
Thank you Steve Jobs for your brilliant ideas...your perseverance...your dreams.  You have been an inspiration to many and have shared your knowledge with the world. We thank you for what you have brought to all of us.
So sad and sorry that all humanity lost such a geniuss that will be  remembered for eternity !  RIP Steve,
thank you steve jobs for everything youve done with technology, without you we would still be using walkmans 
Hello,     Would like to extend my deepest regret and condolences to Apple for the loss of Steve.  I'm a recent fan of Apple products envisioned by Steve, and this news is just too sudden and saddening. 
Mr. Jobs was the Thomas Edison of our generation. If it wasn't for him,  i would not be typing on this mac right now. He really did change the  world we live in today. RIP
Thanks for all the inspiration you have brought to the world!!!!  
Steve is more than a legend. I have personally followed his style, principles and methods, a very dauting task. No doubt the WORLD has lost a very important piece. My condolences to his family and the Apple Family. He will forever be remembered.
Thank you Steve Jobs for bringing the world into the 21st Century with   your visionary creativity!!  You have touched so many of us throughout   our daily lives with great innovations and designs.  There will be no   other like you.  I wish you peace and strength as you journey on.  It   was sad to see how cancer had taken its toll on your body.  But, even   then, we could see that your mind was still as sharp as a tack!  There   is no doubt that you will be missed!   May God bless you and those   you've left behind.  Rest in Peace, Steve!!     
I will remember u for ever when I looking my iPhone . R.I.P&nbsp;
Apple will live forever and for that so will you as well. You made the  world a better place &amp; You opened up your mind and creativity for world  to see. For that, I thank you. RIP  Thanks,
Arigato, Steve. Rest in Peace&nbsp;
 Wow, what a huge loss to the technology world, R.I.P Steve Jobs....a tru trend setter and visionary that saw the direction of technology. You will be missed!!!!            
The world has lost one of the greatest innovators of all time. He's the  reason I'm a graphic designer. I started on the newspaper staff in  college on one of the very first Macs and I was hooked. At that time, we  still had to do paste-up but it was soooo much easier. And it kept  getting easier. Nearly 23 years working with Macs, I've been preaching  the gospel of Apple to every PC user I know. Apple has gotten my mom and  my aunt to leave their PCs behind. They've now surpassed me and with  their iPads and teach me! I will always be an Apple fan and wish the  best to the company. They've got some big shoes to fill but I know they  will. May Steve's star always shine brightly!&nbsp;
Thanks for making my life easier and through your products my family closer. You did an incredible service to help bring people closer together than ever before.  Thanks for sharing your talent with the world. 
I was saddened to hear the news of Steve Jobs passing. He changed the way people listen to music, the way people communicate, and the way we connect. While others were thinking about simply how to make their product better, he helped to make Apple's products revolutionary. And above all, he ensured that these products could be used by anyone and everyone. He helped to found a company that seems to change technology and the world every year. I send my condolences to his family and co-workers. Just know that this man helped lay the foundation for endless creativity and imagination and will be sorely missed.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs changed my world. He made me a computer lover: I am in love with  my Mac and all my Apple products. I am a hard core Apple lover (I still  have the very first version that came out, and I've owned every other one  since). <br>
I saw the 1984 commercial when it aired. And a few months later, my best friend bought the first Mac. We sat and looked at it sitting on her desk. I asked her 'what are you going to do with that?' She said she was going to make a list of all her albums. I said that's a lot of money to spend on something you could write down with pen and paper. She said, no, this thing is going to change the world. She was right. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. My heart goes out to your family and friends. And I rejoice in  everything you have, and will continue to add to my life. Blessings.
Steve, you will forever be remembered... You changed my life 12 years ago when I became a Mac User and have been ever since.  I'm so sad to hear of this news.  You really made a difference and will always be remembered!  Thank you for everything you've done.  I am very sad today after hearing this and feel like I've lost a close friend or family member because of the opportunities you've given to me from your creative genius!  You were an amazing man.  R.I.P. My friend... <br>
Beyond the technology that he created, his influence and his legacy leaves behind a better world. 
It never mattered how one felt about the apple products. Steve was always in the frontline concerning the realization of what was in the public interest in such a manner that can be nothing but impressive. He never lost contact with the common man even though all his achievements throughout his too short lifespan. He left behind a legacy, one that any man would have been proud of.  This world has lost what can be called a mentor. I hope you are in a better place now, without all the pain.  RIP 
Steve you were a master of what you did, your status as a legend within the tech industry will always be remembered. RIP, the world has lost a great visionary. 
I want to share my condolences with the Jobs family, and the entire Apple Community.     I have owned an Apple from the first day they came out!!     I still use my Black Wall Street G-3 250 to this day.    I use my iPad2 more, but still own my first laptop, and will never let it go.     I love Steve Jobs, and the company he created.     I will always be an Apple fan for life.     I am a publisher, business owner, and Philanthropist.       My quote is:  "If you want to work on computer, buy a PC  If you want to get work done, buy an Apple"&nbsp;
It is such a sad message on such a sad day like today, when the world has lost one of its greatest personalities of all time. So I just want to say "one more thing": R.I.P. Steve, great Job(s)!! <br>
I have grown to follow in the footsteps of Mr. Jobs, staying humble, and  yet showing the world where you're headed. With his launch of Mac OS and  iOS, he has definitely shown the world where to go, and if it weren't  for Mr. Jobs, we, as the world, really wouldn't be here right now. Thank  you so much Mr. Jobs  My condolences.
Steve Jobs is the only CEO that I really ever cared about and I am sad  to hear of his passing. He will be missed.&nbsp;
 I'm sad today, the news shock me a lot when i hear it, but steve will remain in our hearts always because he was the biggest  creator in the world, designer of dreams and fun...i'm really really sorry :( we will always remember him, here in Chile we are lovers of apple's industry. my very sensitive condolences to the family and friends
As I sit in front of my beautiful display, that is connected to my  wonderfully-reliable MacBook, knowing that my iPhone will wake me up,  connect me with my loved ones and help make my day-to-day living that  much easier &amp; enjoyable ... I am saddened to hear that the man behind  them all is no longer with us.   
Steve..............thanks for your amazing job on how you made computers  something that everyday people could find useful &amp; understandable.  You  were an amazing person &amp; your fight with cancer is an inspiration to  all.  God bless.
Thanks Steve for sharing your creative genius with us.  You changed the world. I'm copying in my 5 month old daughter Zoe to this email because I want her to know about one of the greatest modern day inventors and visionaries that we have ever seen. Rest in Peace Steve. &nbsp;You fulfilled your destiny.&nbsp;
God speed Steve on your journey to heaven.    
The first computer program I wrote was on an Apple IIe, 22 years ago.  The last one I wrote was on a MacBook Air, a few hours ago. Thanks Steve.  
I'm part of the generation who grew up in a world which, in large part,  Steve is responsible for creating. My first computer experience was with  the Mac SE in my Dad's theatre department office in the late '80s. In  the following years, I grew up and so did Apple. Many of the key moments  in my life occurred alongside, and occasionally as a direct result of,  my love for the company and what it stood for. It's hard to believe that  someone I never even met could've been such an important part of my  life, but through his vision, Steve truly was. It's equally hard to  imagine that now he's gone.  Goodbye Steve. And thank you. &nbsp;
 I would like to express my condolences to Steve's family, friends and fellow Apple employees.   He will be greatly missed.
God bless his soul. He was truly a visionary and made Apple what it is today . The world has lost an amazing man this day. The iPhone 4S will now forever  stand for "For Steve".  RIP Steve Jobs. The world will miss you.
Our deepest condolences to Steve's family and friends. Indeed, Steve is a visionary. Not only does he inspire his colleagues, he also inspire others around him and all over the world because of his ingenuity. The world truly lost a great man.&nbsp;
"I want to put a ding in the universe." -Steve Jobs  And you did Steve, you truly did.  Rest in peace. 
Dear Steve,     You introduced products and concepts that have changed the way we live. Millions around the world who may have never met or heard about you enjoy the products that you brought, to make the world a bit better than what it was. I am sure everyone will remember the speech that you gave at the Stanford graduation ceremony in 2005.     If there is one way, that I can honor you, it is this - Every day for the rest of my life, I will follow my heart and do something that will benefit someone whom I may never meet or know.      REST IN PEACE.
I just want to convey my deepest sympathy's to Steve's family and  friends.  I am honored to have been a part of Steve's legacy as an Apple  customer.  Though he has left us, he will never be forgotten.
To apple,  Im only 16 and didn't even know Steve Jobs as a person, but as a  creator. He has been one of my heroes for a long time because he showed  me to "think different". Im a truly saddened by the worlds loss today. Its  written on my bucket list to meet him, but sadly I will never be able to  cross it off. He gave me so much and I love all my apple products (also  currently using my mail app). So I will try to stop crying and leave  Steve in my heart forever. &lt;3
I never had the fortune to have met Steve Jobs, but i feel the loss.  My  heart goes out to his family, sadly missed. 
I just wanted to express my condolences to Mr. Jobs family, friends, and  all the employees at Apple. I heard the news from an app on my iPad,  text some of my friends about it on my iPhone, read the news on my  Macbook air, and am typing this email on my iMac. I use, love, and  appreciate the incredible products that Mr. Jobs and Apple create and as  deeply saddened as I am by the news, I have faith that Apple will  continue to thrive as a company that has and always will make him proud.  I am so sorry for his family's loss. RIP Mr. Jobs. 
My condolences go out to the Apple family upon the loss of Steve Jobs today. It's hard to imagine that he is gone.  I'm a 42 year old graphic designer and photographer in Richmond, VA. My earliest memories go back to the Apple II that my father purchased, probably in the early 80s. I was amazed by pong and learning BASIC to create my own math programs. Of course, spent hours playing video games off of floppy discs as well. Since college, my design career would've been impossible without the Mac and all the peripherals associated with it. I've spent more time using Macs than any other technology, by a long shot. The best thing about Apple technology that Jobs gave me was that I don't have to think about the tool that much. I can spend my energy in building and creating with it.  I think he was a gift from God to us. My thoughts go out to his family, friends and co-workers today.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs. A great man, an inspiring leader. The world loses an entrepreuner. Apple loses a lot of its soul. The advertising and the graphic design world was never the same after Jobs´creations. Rest in peace, great man. You deserve the best in honours and respect!
Thanks for changing the world, for thinking different, for not only creating the technology, but for giving it a heart and soul. For making it just work.  Thanks for inspiring me with your creations and visions... My condoleances to your family and loved ones...  Your unknown friend and ally
For your vision, for your drive, for your excellence, thanks, Steve.  I  love what you've made possible for me to do.  My life would be less had  you not been here.&nbsp;
I am really devastated because of the death of Steve Jobs. This man  impacted my life technologically like never before. I've worked with  apple products since 1984. His products have allowed me to bring all my artistic dreams to life. Because of him I was able to provide for  my family by working in the music and graphic design industry. I  remember when the graphic design world changed because of the Macintosh  and the music world was turned upside down because of the Mac. Because  of Steve, we can design like Picasso and write and produce music like a  Stevie Wonder. We can sell our music to the world without having to go  thru a record label.  Wow! Again...Steve...Thank you. 
I was able to make a living thanks to Steve Jobs &amp; the team at Apple. Being able to utilize a MacBook Pro &amp; Final Cut have allowed me to support my family &amp; enjoy working on a computer at the same time. A concept that could of only existed thanks to Apple.I've found myself to be an Apple evangelist which is ironic since I've never  been one to drink anyone else's Kool-aid but the way Apple does things has made me a loyal customer &amp; now several friends &amp; family members of mine.When I first touched a personal computer as a kid it was a Mac (Apple II) playing the Oregon trail game. I was addicted playing the game at the local li brary. When I see kids in the apple store exploring macs I am often reminded  of my early experiences with the Mac. It's been a part of my life from a very early age until today &amp; I expect it to be for many years to come.Thank you Steve for championing the user experience &amp; for doing it the "right  way". You will be missed by many, your passing is much too soon but your passion &amp; understanding of your customers will be hard to surpass. Blessings &amp;  peace to your family, you will be missed.&nbsp;
what a loss
Thank you for changing the world. You will be missed. 
Our world will never be the same without Steve.  He is (already) and will be sorely missed. I never knew or met him, but feel like I've lost a good friend. He was an incredible human being -- may he rest in peace.&nbsp;
With all the Apple products that surround me to help me with my creative endeavors, it is hard not to feel like we have lost a close friend. Thank you for making my job as an artist, exciting, and reach levels that I could not have done without my MacPro laptop , and all other Apple devices that communicate to all around.You will be missed.&nbsp;
Thank you Steven. 
For everything. 
Steve was the reason I am a geek. He was why I loves consumer electronics. He changed the way we listened to music, used a phone, worked, or LIVED OUR LIVES. He's the reason I have an iPad right beside this Mac, and an iPhone buzzing with tweets and SMSs of people spreading the sad news. I can't think of anyone who changed the world more than Steve. From creating the world's most awesome company to inspiring me trying to perfect everything. Thank You for giving the world what you gave. We hope we live up-to your expectations.
I just want to say that Mr. Jobs was, is, will be one of those amazing people that at least made me look life in a different way, find beauty in things that most people ignore and don't care to analyze.   Rest In peace Mr Jobs.  
   Listening to Steve, you could feel the excitement he created by envisioning the future of communication and technology in our hands. &nbsp;He was truly an icon, and a magnificent visionary of things to come. &nbsp;He will be missed by all who shared his vision. &nbsp;We need more people like him.
I am just an Apple customer but feel that a family member has passed away.   Wishing the best to the spirit of Steve Jobs and the best for his surviving family.   We are the same age and its been a wondrous ride watching Apple mature.   I will remember you always as I use my Imac, MacBook Air, Iphone and Ipad each and everyday.   God Bless you Steve and may your spirit at peace with God.   We will always miss you.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for all you have done for the world. You are truly one of the most inspiring people the earth has ever seen throughout history. Apple would not be Apple and Pixar would not be Pixar without your dedication and passion that is so rarely seen among the world's CEOs and leaders. You have changed the world forever with the fire you had for your company and your customers. You are a role model to me and inspired me to Think Different by the way you lead multiple industries and approached things with creativity and passion, not bureaucracy. May you rest in peace and enjoy that puffy white iCloud.&nbsp;
The world lost a true genius, visionary and innovator today. God bless his family during this difficult time.
A few men could thing as different that their thoughts could change the  world, he was one of them.  His vision and his way to make that the  things happens is writting in the history.
we love you steve and all your wonderful products!  you were truly a man among men!!!! you will be missed!!
 I remember watching my first Apple keynote in 2004...6 iPods, 2 MacBooks, 2 iPhones, 2 iPod Touches, 1 iMac, 1 AppleTV and many other Apple products later -- I'm still a loyal consumer to the Apple brand,   Thank you Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
A major loss to the world. His achievements, ideas and creativity has benefited the world as a whole. A great inspiration and a beautiful mind.  God Bless his soul and his family and friends.    
Dear Steve   U don't know me, but I will miss U.   God bless U and rest in peace.
I am so saddened by the loss of Steve. I know Apple is in good hands and will continue to thrive; however, his absence will be felt by all. My heartfelt sympathy to his wife Laurene, and their children. I thank Steve for changing my life and changing the world. His vision at Apple will live on, as he will live on in our hearts.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to Jobs's family, friends, and co-workers. We all have lost one of the greatest men in this age.  
Senhores,     Tenho muita admiracao e consideracao pelo criador das  ferramentas que modificaram a cultura de todo o mundo.   Para a familia de de Jobs muita forca e coragem.     
 As a developer I was fortunate enough to meet and chat with Steve the   day after he unveiled the Next computer. It struck me how   approachable he was, how comfortable he made everyone feel, and how   he really did listen to what people had to say.  Starting with the days of programming on the Apple II, Apple has   always been an integral part of my life.  I loved to take 1/2 days off, lock the home office door and watch the   live Apple events... they were always inspiring to watch. My clients   didn't have me for that time, but the inspiration carried on into   their projects.  Thanks Steve for imagining a better world...
My condolence to Mrs Jobs and the Jobs family.  Steve Jobs had a vision and created Apple. I cannot remember a day without my iPhone or other products that have become  part of our every day life, thank you Steve Jobs for creating such an excellent company. His vision will live on and I will remain a loyal customer of Apple products. 
Mr. Jobs was an incredible man who was ahead of his time.  He made me remember why I love technology in the first place.    May God Bless his Family.  Rest in Piece Mr. Jobs.  -iSad 
I really want to cry ... Steve was the best man in the last decades. He invented things that we actually use daily ... We're going to miss you Steve! 
i loved what he did for apple. i think we wouldn't be here without his wisdom. he was truly the great one. he should be remembered thill the end. 
 Who changed the world, paradise now changed for the better. Rest in peace Steve!&nbsp;
I've been an Apple fan since I first used a Mac in the early 1990s, and  progressed to "Apple geek" status a few years later. There aren't many  products that I'd wait in a long line for, but I've been out there  excitedly waiting to get operating system upgrades and attend Apple  Store openings.  The products introduced by Steve Jobs and Apple over  the past decade have been truly innovative, inspired passionate loyalty  from me and many people that I know, and literally changed my life. I'll  admit that despite my love for my iPhone, I was skeptical when the iPad  was introduced, but here I am now typing on my iPad, a truly  life-changing device for me. Thanks to Steve, computing will never be  the same and the world will never be them same. I know Steve's spirit  will continue to inspire Apple employees and Apple customers for many  years to come. Thanks for sharing your genius with the world, Steve Jobs!&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to the Jobs family.  May God grant His peace to you, and may you find comfort in Him!  Sam&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs' family, Apple,  My deepest condolences. Jobs' life is a testimony of what achievements  humans are capable of. He will remain as a source of inspiration to all  of us here on earth. This is a sad day. I am glad his memory brightens a day.  Even though I am a humble computer scientist in a country far away, he  has been such a big inspiration with his entrepreneurial spirit and  guts.   Deepest condolences.
Very sorry for your loss.  Always wanted to meet Steve but wow. Sorry God had to take him so early.  Hang in there everyone.
 We've lost one of the greatest geniuses to ever set foot on this planet  R.IP Jobs  R.I.P
Dear Steve -  Thank you so much for your innovative mind and contributions to my generation. I have been a loyal fan of you and Apple ever since my very first Apple. The world has lost one of the greatest minds of our time, and your legacy will live on in technology forever.
Oh Wow!  This is such a shock..he's gone too soon! Steve we will definitely  miss you! You've changed so many lives with your innovative ideas. Your  family will be in our prayers!
I don't know what I would do if I didn't have my IPhone, IPad  Mac pro and the hundreds of apps. Steve Jobs was genius. Hope Apple will go on inventing for many many years.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has been an inspiration in my life since I can first remember. His life story is simply magnificent. Although I never got the chance to meet the man, I will truly miss him. He has been a hero to so many. He will be remembered for all time for all the good he has brought to this world. God Bless Steve Jobs.
See You Later, Mr. Jobs. And Thanks for so many treasures. 
Thanks for building the stuff we love!  
I... I don't even know what to say. &nbsp;I'm a PC user, but I'm beginning to feel it is time to make the switch, when I can afford it. &nbsp;Steve... he's always inspired me. &nbsp;That man was the most innovative person of our time. &nbsp;No, not arguably, he WAS the greatest one. &nbsp;A man doesn't build something in this world without having a great vision, and Steve has done just that. &nbsp;He was a man who knew what he wanted, and would settle for nothing less than perfection. &nbsp;That's an attitude I can respect, and do my best to emulate. &nbsp;Rest in peace, Steve. &nbsp;I just wanted to say... I'll miss him. &nbsp;
  So incredibly sad. We all have lost someone very special. What a  genius. My prayers to his loved ones.
I have no ideas how sad i would be until now.  You changed the world, more over, you have changed everyone's attitude towards our life.  You gotta find who you are instead of someone who forced you to be.    I just feel so sad. You have changed the world, but the world can't change you.  Take care.
i don't know you but may god rest you in peace  thank you for creating this amazing company <br>
Such a visionary, who has left behind a truly awe inspiring legacy, and was sadly taken too soon.&nbsp;
Thanks for searching after your vision and dreams! You made our world a much happier and connected place.  We'll be praying for your family's comfort.  Rest In Peace Steve.
 Thank you for bringing great products in to our lives. We will forever be grateful to your genius. &nbsp;See you again some day.&nbsp;
I am a high school student from China, the first cellphone I used was  iPhone, the first MP4 I used was iPod, the first laptop I  owned was  Macbook Pro. I am so appreciated that Jobs made the technology world so  great, we will remember Steve Jobs forever!!!!!!!!!!! 
Dear Steve,&nbsp;When I open the computer,I read the news of your pass away,I thought it was a joke.&nbsp;I try to verify this news from other official website,I can believe it is true.&nbsp;Although I did not buy any product of Apple,but Steve is mentor and a friend deep in my heart.&nbsp;Your spirit will always with me,I will miss you Steve! &nbsp;
Steve was a true leader and visionary. There is no doubt in my mind that  he will be remembered by millions, and will go down in history as one of  the great minds of the 21st century. My sincere condolences too all his  friends and family.
To Apple Inc.   To a man who had it all, A man who created for us all, A man who led us all, A man who dreamt it all,  To a man who will forever be in our hearts, minds and iOS devices.  A man who was more than a man.   Steve Jobs – May your soul forever rest in peace.
   Dear Steve,   Thank you for making our desires a reality when he created technology products easy to use for everyone. Never forget everything you did for humanity to put in place their fabulous ideas! Today children, the elderly and people who never had contact with a computer has the opportunity to interact naturally with the digital environment, provided through these tools to express their feelings, dreams and give color to the world by spreading the unimaginable, what once will only remain in being.   Rest in peace, you deserve the best.&nbsp;
 RIP Steve Jobs.  You will be with us everyday.  Thank YOU. 
 Thank you Steve Jobs, you made the world a better place. You will be missed :(              
Steve,  I wish you all the best.  I just wanna say, I've had my iPod shuffle for almost 3 years, and it is with me when I work out, do homework and shopping. It brings me joy and peace, among countless good memories, it is with me.  My Mac helps me with my presentations, data analysis, and surf the internet.  I have plans to buy an iPhone, and iPad, saving now.  These are not just products, these are the source of information, source of communication, and source of joy. I enjoy my life with Apple!  I am so sorry that you are gone, cos I thought I would see you in the future to tell you how much I like Apple products...  Now I will watch you introduce iPhone 4 video to remind me of your voice and your talent...&nbsp;
Dear family and friends,  One the greatest minds has left us behind today and I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the Jobs family. He's passion and drive even in the face of death was incredible, and it allows us all to dig deeper, think smarter about life.  I've never had the pleasure of meeting him in person but after seeing this vision displayed in the heart of the Apple, it left me wonderful to how far our minds can travel to the depths of imagination. He will truly be missed by all and thank you Mr. Job's for sharing your passion, vision, integrity, genius and tenacity for life and inspiring us all to dream larger than life.
Steve Jobs has meant a lot to me in the short time I've been an Apple  enthusiast. I appreciated so much the attention to detail, quality, and  design and the passion that Steve Jobs put into the devices he and his  company created. This still doesn't feel real, that Steve is really  gone. The legacy he has left behind is going to be much bigger than the  man himself. I consider it a privilege to be a part of the first  generation of life-changing products that Steve invented, and I will be  excited to tell my kids and grandkids the awesome stories of Jobs'  product presentations and how I saw him change the world. He hasn't just  impacted and changed the world, he has changed and impacted me. I am praying for his  family in what is undoubtably a very difficult time. Steve, you will  be missed. 
Steve, thanks for being an inspiration. For changing and enabling the world. For creating awesome, beautiful things. You will be missed.
I am proud to say that I own and use one of Steve Jobs creations every day.  With this new launch coming up I cannot help but to make this one as a tribute to a very bright and brilliant man, a man who made a very large dent in how a lot of us live and work everyday, I will continue to pass along his passion for his products to my customers and again make this weekend and the months to come a tribute to a very bright star. Steve Jobs R.I.P
To Steve Jobs: I'm a Chinese student. I want to say Apple has impressed us, and so do you.  Thank you, and I'll miss you.&nbsp;
デザインの力に自信を失いかけてる世の中だけど、いつまでもクリエイター達の夢であり、心の指標です。 ありがとう。  Stay hungry, Stay foolish.  謹んでお悔やみ申し上げます。
I feel as though I lost a personal friend, though I never met Steve.    He was inspiring, demanding, visionary, and world-changing.  The world   is a better place because of him, and we are better off. Thank you.  You'll be sorely missed. 
The world has lost a genius, you go Jobs.
 I really would like to thank.  As a design student that uses the "equipment" and as a design student that face a real, concrete example that one can make things simple, better, bring a meaning in real concept, not only market facelifts, think on how people live and understand the world, and mostly, what is needed, and that's what I believe design is all about. So, once more, I thank. That this beautiful concern does not lose itself across the path of time and the changes that may come.               
Our deepest condolences to the Jobs family and to the Apple family. The world has indeed lost a great thinker, innovator, mover, shaker and role model for every kid out there. Mr Jobs you will be greatly missed by us.&nbsp;
apple has been a great company, and i will continue to shop there. I  will miss Steve and his keynotes. Good Bye Steve you have brought apple  into its golden age. R.I.P. to a true visionary 
Goodbye Steve ,farewell jobs .  Goodbye my idol, farewell living god of our era.   Rip my guidance...&nbsp;
You revolutionized the computer industry in 1984 with the Macintosh. You revolutionized the music industry in 2001 with the iPod. You revolutionized the phone industry in 2007 with the iPhone. You changed the world in 1976 when you founded Apple. &nbsp;Rest In Peace Steve Jobs 
I have never written anything like this for a stranger, but considering the impact apple has played in my life, I felt compelled to pay tribute to this amazing person.    I have been an apple guy all my life ­ since the Apple II.   Even through the supposed demise of the company, I have been singing Apple's praises. Something intangible kept me coming back for more -­ it was intoxicating opening up a brand new computer, and still is.  It's just "one more thing" that made owning an Apple better than anything else.  Never before has someone I've never met had such an influence on how I see what's possible, and how to think outside the grey plastic box.  The world has lost a true visionary much too soon, but for those who were close to Steve Jobs, I'm sure the loss cannot be put into words.
Dear, Whoever reading this  I heard Steve passed away and didn't believe it I then checked around and found out it was true. I don't have much to say except R.I.P Steve Jobs &nbsp;
Hello,  I would just like to offer my deepest condolences to Mr.Jobs's personal family and to his professional family Apple Inc. Mr. Job's family will remain in my prayers and thoughts. Steve Jobs provided the world with his imagination and his creativity to truly change the course of the world for the better. He has served as a personal inspiration for me to draw on my own creativity and imagination to pursue my own dreams. He will truly be missed.
Thoughts and prayers to the family...a man who injected creativity   into life.  Rest in peace!!!!
We are at a loss,  Steve changed the world, not once or twice but several times, he became the reason for cheer, his genius raised the bar for customer centricity and gave us something to look up to, something to look forward to every Christmas. He created standards that forced other organizations to think and rethink, he created magic and almost single handedly kept the 'wow' factor alive giving us consumers an experience dreams are made up of... To the most impactful business leader of all times, my salutations. You have been a part of my family will be missed a lot. 
R.I.P. Steve Jobs.   I'm deeply impressed what he was able to do,  and how he has mastered his lowest times,  and how he appeared in his best times.  I wish more people would have his power and vision. <br>
Good bye, Steve. Wherever you are, be aware that everything you did was  not in vain. I wish we never forget the lessons you taught us.  May God comfort your family and this country. 
OUR PRAYERS AND CONDOLENCES GOES OUT TO STEVE'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS. &nbsp;WE LOVE YOU STEVE. WE WILL MISS YOU FOR EVER. &nbsp; REST IN PERFECT PEACE STEVE JOBS&nbsp;
As I sit in front of my iMAC and read the sad words of Steve Jobs  passing I feel a heartache and sadness that is as strong as if I had  lost a member of my circle of friends.  Steve Jobs will be greatly  missed.  I wish to extend my sympathy to his family and friends who love  him and have lost a very special person.  May he always be remembered  for not only his genius but for his passion and love for family and  friends.  
Thank you for the inspiration and your story-book like career.  God bless.  
The world has lost a visionary! What more could have come! R.I.P Steve jobs!&nbsp;
My condolences to Steve's family, friends and coworkers. Though I've never met the man, he has inspired me to set the bar higher in work and play but also to question what is really important. I watch his Stanford commencement address often - a few very powerful life lessons from a man whose life was very rich but far too short. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;     
Dear Steve Jobs,    You were one of the greatest business men all over the world.  I feel very sorry that you were gone.  My warmest tribute to the memory of the deceased. 
 Steve's vision and leadership of Apple was revolutionary and transformed the company to be at the forefront of it's industry. I don't think I've ever met someone as dedicated as he was. He had a goal and he accomplished it beautifully. His characteristics should be those of every successful CEO and it's depressing that the world has lost him. I had no idea that he was so close to passing away, I don't think anyone thought it would of happened this sudden. Although he was a cancer patient, he outlived all predictions and went strong for so long. RIP Steve.. you were great to not just people of your company, but to consumers, fans, and people in the industry.  May you rest in peace
you inspired me in so many ways. the world is a better place because of you.  thank you steve for all that you've done. 
Steve, You were a true visionary and an influence to the world. One could one hope to be as big as you. From the bottom of our hearts  (i'm sure i can speak for everyone) you will be dearly missed in this  world.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,   You have been an inspiration to us all. May you be as luminary in your next life as you have been in this.   Condolences to the family. May you find solace in knowing that Steve was beloved.
Let us think of Steve Jobs as the genius, the seed out of whom has come the mighty oak that will grow on and on . . .  With untold gratitude. Thank you Steve!&nbsp;
You are a shining example to the world of what hard work, perseverance  and love for people can produce. In a world filled with "greed is good" and "anything goes" philosophies,  you were a rare example of a man with integrity. Rest in peace and Thank you. 
I have followed Steve Jobs' career and bought his products since 1984. I am currently typing this on my iPad while texting to my niece and nephew on my iPhone. I use a MacBook everyday at home, an iMac at work. I wirelessly back up my MacBook to my Time Capsule and watch movies, podcasts and listen to music on my Apple TV. I'd like to think that as an Apple evangelist I've sold a lot of products for Apple over the past 27 years. Funny thing is, I know you'll be getting an unbelievable amount of emails just like this. I also owe my career as an IT Manager at a local automobile dealership organization to Steve Jobs and Apple.   Thanks Steve for making the last 27 years different and insanely interesting!&nbsp;
I Loved Your Work Steve... Still will be looking forward to ios5 release and  now I guess your the one in the iCloud!&nbsp;
Dear you all: Steve is a person worth remembering forever. We will remember always the contribution he has made to the world and the way he has changed us.&nbsp;
I never met Steve but he has been an integral part of my life and life  as we know it.  The fulfillment of his vision brought life to the  creative visions of this generation and generations to come.  His foot  print in the digital stratosphere will endure and for this I say  ....Thank you. You will be missed and remembered.&nbsp;
he fought such a fight.  incredible human. 
Steve Jobs was a great man with amazing ideas i'm left with 3 of his legacies: The iPad, The Macbook Pro, and the iPhone 4. He was one  of the greatest innovators ever to step on earth today and he will be greatly missed. i send my condolences to his family and Thank Steve Jobs for Making what Apple is today, may you rest in peace and be with God. 
Steve Jobs has inspired me to learn and know about the tech industry since i first started back in 2001. I will always remember what he has given to me and the rest of the world. A loyal apple fan i always have been and i will remain loyal to the empire this man has built.&nbsp;
I am so sorry to hear the news this morning over here at Malaysia. Steve Jobs was a great visioneer and a pioneer to the technology world. My condolences to Apple, and family members of Steve Jobs.
Steve was a true visionary. I was interested in Apple computers back in the early 90's, but it wasn't until Steve's return to the company that I became truly excited about them. It was Steve's vision, confidence and energy that seemed to extend all who saw him (which, unfortunately, I never got to see in  person) at any of his keynotes speeches. I won't pretend to know him, but he seemed like the type of person you would like to know. My condolences to his family. Rest in peace, Steve. For all you have done, you deserve it. Thank you.&nbsp;
Im currently a apple product owner, from my MacBook pro,iPhone 4, iPod touch 4th gen, and iPad 2. I will miss him like if he was part of my family. All my  condolences to his family and he shall R.I.P..... You'll be missed
I am very saddened to hear of the passing of Steve Jobs. As a designer,  my whole career has been built around using the innnovative products  from Apple. He was a true visionary and genius. He will be missed. 
His creativity and persistence have changed our living. Steve has done an utmost achievement to change the world. I believe he has already got Nobel prize in technology from all of us already and his spirit is always with us. Thank you so much, Steve. I would like to forward my bless to his family and fellows.&nbsp;
Truly someone who inspired many of us and will continue to do so for  many more years to come. A legend of all times. He will live in our  hearts for ever. R.I.P SJ.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was not just the American Dream but the Global Dream. Buddhist. American. Born to a Syrian Muslim mother. Adopted. Starving student. Intern. No matter his label, he was always determined to do better for the future. It's not the number of the days in your life that makes your life remarkable. It's the remarkable deeds /actions you do with your life, that makes your life remarkable. Steve Jobs was a remarkable man. He left a positive impact on the world. He will forever live on  because he made mankind realize how you can do what is labeled the impossible, if you think and look out of the box. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thanks for everything Steve. I am only a ordinary system analyst, but I have learned to appreciate  you and your innovation. Thank you very much for what you have done for Technology and for the  humanity. Go my friend and if there is other lives, I would really like to meet  you again! Peace! Go with your way to the eternal knowledge. FOREVER IN MY HEART&nbsp;
what a terrible loss.....a true visionary and a leader..... i have been using all his products and that in a country where "APPLE' does not have his own base and where there are many issues but its his vision, intensity which made me accept all of that .........this is a really a sad day....... my condolences to the family and near &amp; dear ones.....&nbsp;
Through Steve's efforts, the World redefined what it thought about computers
Steve Jobs has been a big inspiration to me. I run a tech youtube channel and I don't think I would have been this far on youtube if it wasn't for Steve Jobs, He created the computer I edit videos on, he created the phone I use on a daily basis, he was an amazing family member to the tech world and I send my prayers out to Steve, The Jobs Family and Apple today. To this day and further on I am inspired by Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs......One in a Trillion.......how fortunate we all are to have  had Steve on this planet with us. How fortunate to know and experience  his work. We are ever thankful for him and his genius. Extending heartfelt sympathies to you all.
Dear Apple, I graduated from Stanford in 1995, and have had Macs since 1992. I went through the tough years in the mid to late 90s when no one believed in Apple. During my 20 years of using Macs, nothing beats the return of Steve Jobs and what he and the Apple team have done since. Teaching at a major research university and seeing more than half of my students with Apple laptops remind me everyday how much things have changed. We owe Steve Jobs not just for how he developed Apple, but above all for making the use of computer user-oriented.&nbsp;
You were a true inspiration to me, to the world R.I.P Steve Jobs Sent from my iPad 
Steve Jobs, You brought more to the world than your genius.  You brought inspiration  to many, especially to me.  I only hope that one day I can change the  world as you did.  Although you are gone, your magic is still at work  and forever will be through the people you have inspired.  Thank you for  everything.  I have always admired the creations coming out of Apple and  Pixar.  I will be praying for your family. Apple, keep up the incredible work!&nbsp;
I am greatful to God to have been raised during a time when great creative minds were at the helm of progressing our lifestyles. From facilitating the way we study to facilitating the way we entertain ourselves.&nbsp; My deepest and most heartfelt condolences to the Jobs family and the Apple family which he so gracefully led into the future of progress. May God Rest his Soul.
 I don't have pretty much to say, but I thank Steve and all the people that worked with him and supporting him for all this years, especially after getting ill.  His is a mentor for the whole humanity.  Give my condolences to his family. He will be in our hearts forever.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an amazing man. I would eagerly wait for him to announce what was coming next. I will always remember "one more thing." that was followed by a surprise. There will never be another Steve Jobs and I am happy to know I was alive and able to see all the changes he made to it. Steve gave us a new world. I hope we can keep moving in a direction that he dreamed about. Thank you for changing my life Steve Jobs.
Too young and too talented to have been taken from us.   May his spirit  live on.
RIP, amazing innovator, cultural changer, and generation creator.

As somebody who has used a PC all his live, I have recently at age 60 baught  my first iMac computer after owning an iPhone and an iPad. Go figure! I am in shock about today's sad news of his passing and am angry that such a  bright person and innovator like Steve did not have the chance to live and produce for a few more decades as he had hoped and expressed in his 2005 Stanford speech. My sincere condolences to his family and his co-workers. A deeply saddened admirer.&nbsp;
Wow When I Heard Of His Passing I Was Shocked, Didn't Think It Was That Bad,  Shows How Private He Was. He Touched Millions With His Technology. Condolences To His Family, I Know He's Someone Who Will Dearly Be Missed.
The iPod changed my life and the iPad is starting to...thanks Mr. Jobs and Apple.
Grazie uomo!!!&nbsp;
For all of us Mac users, we owe a great man a moment of reverence for   his vision, acuity, and astute instincts for a great company/product   that served the people of the world in countless ways..........Rest in   Peace Mr. Jobs 
Steve jobs thank you for creating such amazing products.  it's your  inspiration that inspired me to become a computer software engineer.  I  hope some day i can be half the person you were and work for apple. I'll miss you! you will forever be remembered!&nbsp;
             The man who could and always did think outside the box.             Maybe that's why he left high school. Very sorry to see you             go. Had you had a few more years you might have found cure             for the disease that took you. Thanks for all you brought to             us and the tools you leave behind to help us all move             forward.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs, you will surely be missed. Thank you for all your contributions to make things easier. Thanks for the iPods, iMacs, Macbooks, iPhones, and everything. Because of you, we can now purchase songs, books movies and many other things from the comfort of our home. Rest in Peace.
May he, Mr. Steve Jobs, rest in peace, always. I thank him for being the inspiration that he was, and will continue to be.&nbsp;
As a recent college graduate in computer science all I can say is thank you. Thank you for steering my passion, giving me incredible tools and challenging my mind.  Thank you, Steve. 
Thank you for founding and growing up the world greatest company, I would love to work for anytime. Thank you for being such innovative and inspiring. You have changed the world several times and in several aspects. I could not  imagine a life without you and Apple. Well done, Steve! Thank you for everything. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve, your computer solutions and quality standards will serve as a guideline for Apple and the rest of the industry for decades to come. I hope Apple continues the same way as when you was the CEO. Rest in peace Steve, you will allways be remembered ! 
Rest in peace Steve Jobs! You will never be forgotten!
I would Like to offer my sincere and deapest condoleances to Steve's family &amp; close friends. Because of Steve's innovative and creative mind I was seduced into the compu ter realm. And it all started for me with his MacIntosh in 1984. He gave me a new appealing way of looking at these devices wich before appauled me, to say the least. He appealed to my artistic prevalence and offered endless possibilities with conviviality instead of bits and bites. This liberates the mind and lets it free. I am not a programmer or analyst, just a Mac enthusiast.
We will miss you very much! 
Apple is a fantastic organisation and have developed wonderful products, always at the cutting edge of technology and marketing processes. Clearly this is a reflection of the leadership that Steve developed within himself. Certainly a life to celebrate My Thoughts and feelings goes out to those who new him directly, I can only imagine it would be a significant loss.&nbsp;
Thanks to Steve, I own my own business, pave my own way, and chart my  own future. His vision has helped me realize my vision, and realize that  the only way to achieve it is to move forward.RIP, Steve; you will be thunderously missed. Here's to the crazy ones. &nbsp;
I've been through about 4 iPods and my family has a total of 6 apple products. Ever since I could remember I always wanted an iPod, the design and structure was just so intriguing. I'm typing this email from my iPod, actually. I  thank Mr. Jobs for all the time he spent to modernize our world and make the 21st century one with many accomplishments. RIP, Steve Jobs, a genius of our world.
My Condolences to Steve Jobs, he had changed the world with his revolutionary products. Rest In Peace Steave Jobs
To Mr. Job's Family, We are honored to be living under the glow of Steve Job's brilliant aura!&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs is gone but his innovation and creativity will stay in our hearts.
I'm so shocked when I learned this sad news this morning, not only because Steve Jobs' death but this world lost a great human being. Steve has changed the way people living in so many ways. In Taipei, Taiwan, you can see 5 (or even more) of 10 people using the iPhone when you walking in the street, taking the bus. Using iPhone it's a lifestyle to me, and I'll still looking forward about what's new from Apple. &nbsp;
Thank you for everything you did for mankind and the technology world.  You shall surely be missed.  Rest In Perfect Peace!
As a child growing up in an Apple family, I have known Steve Jobs' name and face for a large portion of my life. My father and I always looked forward to his presentations, counting down the days until the MacWorld conference. My thoughts are with his family and friends. Though you already know it, Steve was an amazing innovator who has inspired myself and countless others from my generation to do great things. RIP.
To Steve, his family and the people at Apple,  I was sad to hear about the passing of Steve Jobs. Please accept my humble condolences.  I just wanted to share how much Steve's visionary touch at Apple has made such a profound difference in my life. Whilst I know that I'm just a 'regular joe' consumer, I just wanted to share that Steve Job's magic in creating wonderful products such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod, iTunes and Mac computer, has made my life better. It's always exhilarating opening a new Apple purchase! Please celebrate the successes in Steve's life and continue his legacy vision at Apple.
Hi Steve,I am a huge fan of you from Japan. I don't want to believe that you are gone.You inspired me a lot. My life would be very boring without you and your products.Thank you very much for everything that you did to all of us. Have a great rest.
My sincere condolences to Steve Jobs's family and his company. Us creative people and all those around the world will never forget all he did for this world. A very sad day indeed. May he rest in peace. 
I am so sorry about Apple's loss. He was a creative genius. 
My prayers goes out to your family thank you for building such a great product it truly is a loss for the world. God bless&nbsp;
We live in the future because of Steve Jobs.  It's an unfathomable loss.  My heart felt condolences to his and the Apple family. Thank you Steve Jobs for making us feel like the rest of us were apart  of your family.
Good bye, Steve. You did a great things for this world and it was  accepted by all.  Thanks for your innovations and you will continue to  live in our hearts.
Today, I share the sadness that the world feels.  I just read his Stanford commencement address in 2005 and his words resonate what every person desires, to live and work on what you love doing.  I am lucky to be doing so in my life.  However, this is not about me.  This about extending a heartfelt thank you to Steve, who in his simple desire to recreate the beauty of his imagination, has given the world and my husband a wonderful environment to work in.  Since working within the OS environment, my husband has had a revival of utter passion and joy in his programming work.  Steve has unknowingly infected people with his passion for life. Thank you, Steve Jobs!&nbsp;
The first personal computer I used was an Apple, 1982. I co-introduced Macs to Zamorano 1988.  The first computers I bought for my kids was an Apple Performa 1992,  then an Imac 1999.  I gave a Mac laptop  to my daughter when she went to college 2002.     Geniuses don't last forever.&nbsp;
Sending my condolences to the Jobs family. Thanks goes to Mr. Jobs for his cutting edge innovations and visionary talents. He will be most missed.
The loss of such a remarkable human being...his intellect...his creativity...his innovative spirit...touches us all. His life will be celebrated with each tap.
Wow I'm a soldier in the crusade. Your vision will never be duplicated.
There is not part of my life that Steve hasn't enriched. I can not  express this properly. Steve's passing feels like a personal loss. 
Thanks for all Steve!! We Miss U!!  
I feel so sad and don't know what I should say......  Thank you Steve for the amazing world!  We love you forever!  An Apple fan forever  
Dear Apple people,  I want to share my condolences to all the people at Apple and to Steve's family. Is a great loss for the industry and for all us, that enjoy and vibrate with technology.  In the believing that Steve is in a better place.
Rest in peace  Steve
Steve brought about a revolution in computing and what the world is experiencing today is a result of this great visionary. Technology has taken a leap with his dream coming true and what more satisfaction can a human being better get. He also handed over the reins in time as though he already knew what was coming!!!  I'm sure his soul will rest in peace for all the good that he has done to this world. A sad loss indeed!!!
Mr. Jobs has truly impacted the world.  Our lives have been transformed by way of the ideas he bought forth.  My prayers are with his family and friends.&nbsp;
Hi I'm Sorry for the lost Steve! I heard he was a really good guy! He will be Missed and loved! 
eu tenho apple... descanse em paz... 
I will never forget watching all his videos for the new release of Apple products and how he had just as much excitement as the customers did for the unveiling.  Steve Jobs is a legendary icon for the world today for what he started with and for what he made with it.  To have died at such a young age is a crime and robbed us from such an amazing man who single handedly revolutionized the world.  It's hard to imagine such a world without him.  It will be a long time before we see another Jobs, for his is that of the caliber of that of DaVinci, Newton, Pythagorous, etc... The list can go on but it would only serve to digress, back on the point at hand, if only we could have seen more from such a revolutionary thinker maybe this world would be inspired once more to see what we are capable of as human beings, what our two hands can produce with the combination of our brains.  If I were to take one thing from Steve Jobs it would be the will to go on through.  Even when more than half the global businesses, schools, and household computers were Microsoft, he did not cease to relent, and went on to change that. I personally did not know him but through his products, his gifts to the world, I can only imagine the kind of man he was.  I can only hope for myself to become half the person he was, and to keep his spirit living through myself. 
My wife and I offer sincere condolences to the Family...He was a true Pioneer, Innovator and Visionary.  His contributions to Humanity are unprecedented.  God Bless the Family in their Hour of Need.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,     I'm not one of the most crazy fan of yours, but please take from me the deepest regret, the biggest appreciation for what you've done for this world.     Goodbye my magician, goodbye my inspiration, goodbye my genius, we'll keep thinking differently.     Rest In Peace!&nbsp;
You will surely be missed. My prayers are with you and your family.  To one of the top innovators in the worlds, your legacy will live on.
There are no words to describe Steve Jobs! What a visionary, he will never be forgotten...&nbsp;
  Steve  you has shared your inspiration with the human being. Your legacy will  be with us for ever.  Thanks Steve.
You gave us a dream come true. I will never forget.
I hope one day I will equate to 1% of the man, the dreamer, the innovator, and visionary you are and have left us with.  Thank you 
God Speed Mr. Jobs.  God Speed!  You will be remembered.
Steve Jobs... A Visionary .... A Legend..... A Genius...... You are always alive in the heart of millions of your admirers..... RIP !!!! 
Steve Job's legacy will live forever. He had an enormous affect on the world and the music, phone, computer, and tablet industry. In fact he basically revolutionized the tablet industry. My condolences go out to his family. He will definitely rest in peace.   Anthony  p.s  Apple has change my life ever since 2009 when I got my iPhone 3GS to now with my mid-2010 iMac computer. I used to be a Windows guy but I am so happy I made the switch.  
Thank you Steve. Your Products have changed my family's lives forever. You were the quintessential visionary.  My condolences to the Jobs family.&nbsp;
Steve:  I never met you and it feels like I did. You made my life better! <br>
Thanks Steve Jobs for all the visionary ideas and products you  pioneered. You truly pushed us forward as an innovative society. We have  much to own you for.
Where would we be without him - one of lifes true navigators.  RIP Steve Jobs.  Thanks for the ride
 I know that it won't change a thing ..But thank you Steve ! Not for the iPhone, iPad, iMac, iEverything ! But for the IDEA ! For making me believe that everything will end up well.  You were a trully gifted man. Rest in peace ! The intire planet will miss a man like you !            
I think we all feel personally touched by Steve in our lives.  What an incredible vision and power of execution.  He will be sorely missed by millions of people around the world.  He had a halo effect on all of his products -- the touch screen will never have quite the same 'touch' now.  Goodbye Steve -- if only you had stayed with us a little longer.  Not the same world without you.&nbsp;
Today the world truly lost a great man and I'm sure it's very hard for those you who knew and worked with him personally.  He was a man to be admired in life and in death.  My deepest condolences to the entire Apple family and Mr. Jobs immediate family.  He will be missed. 
Our lives will be dimmer with the passing of a great light that showed  us a new path to technology....I am sure however, that Steve provided  the path for the next Steve Jobs to come along and brighten our lives  soon...RIP to a Great Human Being. 
When you think of innovation you think of Steve Jobs. I believe his face  has presented more life changing things in the last 20 years than anyone  else in this world. He was a genius, and inspiration, and an amazing  man. He will be missed. Even I, as a young kid remember the first time  he revealed an iPod. It changed the way people live today, inspiring a  generation of technology that i know live in. I bet when i grow up and  have children Steve will be in the history books as well as Apple. He  will be missed greatly.20 Rest in peace Steve Jobs&nbsp;
I send my condolences to Mr. Jobs family.  Mr. Jobs will forever be my hero.  Also a thank you to his family for the time they gave to us away from there beloved for all the wonderful innovations he has put his heart and soul into.  My best wishes.
 Too much to say about the feelings of losing a dear friend. To be simple and in line with Steve's Philosophy, "I love you, Steve." expresses all my thoughts.&nbsp;
I just wanted to say although I do not know very much about Steve Jobs I am and have been a proud Mac owner for almost 4 years. The company is clearly one of the greatest business success stories and hearing his philosophy on life and watching the few videos, reading the few articles I've seen of/by him. I too feel like the world has lost an asset.&nbsp;
Incredible Human Being.  Life does not seem long enough for such a  brilliant man.&nbsp;
I feel like I lost a friend today, even though I never met him. He was  an amazing visionary and wonderful person. He set a standard for  technology that could only be matched by something that he created. The  world will never be the same. :( 
We loved your work.  Apple has changed.&nbsp;
I just want thank Steve Jobs for inspiring us with his fantastic dreams. 
 Steve you were a good man that changed the world, may God bless you and give your family peace in your passing.
I did not know you personally, but you were a part of my life.  Thank you for the vision you had and the products you created.  You have changed this world forever, for better.  Sincere condolences to your family and colleagues who did know you, you will be missed forever.         
My heart goes out to Steve's family. I am sorry for your loss.  Thank you Steve for dreaming of the things I didn't ever dream about. When I  dreamt of a cd player that held more CDs, you and your team were working on  putting all the music I love in my pocket. You changed my world for the better. I will miss you.
Keeping the Steve Job family in my prayers. Heaven gained a genius today!&nbsp;
As the co-founder of Apple Steve Jobs made everything imaginable seem possible. His vision brings hope to a world that will forever mourn his passing and never forget his genius.   
Amazing human being that share the most creative spirit making simples things for all of us, thank you Steve !, You are very lucky now you can share your creativity with God. <http: www.faber-castell.cl=""></http:>    
 A bright and great creative mind that left us hungry for more genius ... his spirit will continue to beat in the soul of Apple and Apple lovers.
Gracias por ser una inspiracion. 
 RIP Steve jobs. Thank you for the best phone I've ever had, wherever you are now I know you are making it a better place.&nbsp;
Taken away from all of us too soon. Sincere condolences to friends and family.
I am a Specialist at the Bay Street Apple Store. Because of Steve's vision and passion, I have a job that I love. I am with an amazing company that I can't imagine ever leaving, working with talented and incredible people who put a smile on my face. Every time I put on my blue shirt and hit the floor, I  look forward to sharing my excitement about life-changing products and services with customers and my coworkers. And each day, when I see how a company  and its people have changed the lives of others, I'm inspired to do more. Because Steve lived his life and didn't settle. He knew it was all about the experience. Why not follow his example? I'm so very happy and proud to be part of the Apple family. Thank you, Steve, for being an amazing leader and person. We'll continue what you started, and I know we'll make you proud.
Indirectly, Steve has influenced my life through his fantastic company. I would like to thank this man who i have never met but still seemed so connected with through the evolutionary products that my day to day life now evolves around. The I pad has helped me through my MSc. Strategic project management degree. He has made this world a brighter place. May this legend rest in peace!&nbsp;
  Goodbye Steve... Steve has always been and will be an idol for me and for the people connected with technology and the computer area. &nbsp;I started my course in computer science and I followed its trajectory in his inspiring life story. &nbsp;Steve always showed that he was a very strong and powerfull man, it's a huge example for the society. I'm sure Steve is in heaven creating new technologies for us. I love you Steve, Hugs of a big fan from Brazil.               
Steve,  Thank you so much for taking that country road, "stay hungry, stay foolish."  R.I.P.
Thank you for sharing your Genius with the world.   
Very sad to hear the bad news. I'm honored to be an apple fan to the bone. You will be missed.&nbsp;
Don't really notice how much Steve has had an effect on all of us until  you stop to think about it. Until you unlock your iPhone or open your MacBook or boot up your iMac. I don't just use Apple products because  they work so well or are flawless in design, I use Apple products  because Steve got it.
Steve Jobs was a poet with technology.  He changed my life for the better.  He certainly changed the world.  You will not be forgotten.    Godspeed.&nbsp;
My condolences to his family and the Apple community.  We will miss his innovations and visions immensely.  May his accomplishments inspire the future!&nbsp;
I was a long time converting to the Apple way.  I finally came to realize the wonder of creative people taking their craft to new heights.  Thank you for leading the way, Steve.  We will all miss you.  Our hearts go out, also, to your family.  Rest in peace.
I am deeply saddened by the death of Steve Jobs. It's hard to believe he  is gone. I look forward to a world were illness is a thing of the past  and we live peacefully. This world has lost too many good people. 
Few people change the world, Steve did. My sincerest condolences to his  family, friends and the world.&nbsp;
Steve, to me and many people I know, you are the greatest man the world has ever had.  We will remember you as a very dedicated, innovative and creative man who made technology grow faster than ever.  You pushed the innovation to the limit and achieved amazing things.  Everything you created became part of our life.  I am very sad today but will always be an Apple fan...  Rest in peace Steve and thank you for everything!
To the family and friends of Steve Jobs, I might have been a stranger to him. But his influence and creations were no stranger to me, my family and my  friends. Steve, thank you for a life well lived, visions shared, and memories  created ! May your light shine brightly in the heavens.
Thank you Steve. I never met you, but your mind and heart are with me daily. I am a graphic designer, and without all your help, we would all be lost in this field.  Thank you for taking care of us. Forever a Apple Fanboy!&nbsp;
I wish i would have had the chance to know you personally Steve. Ever since I purchased my first iPhone 3G, I've always wanted to have some position working at apple. I hope that you are in peace now, and I know everybody will always miss and remember you, the person who changed the world. The man who affected millions of people. I know you've changed the way that I have lived my life, and I thank you for that.  RIP Steve.
My most sincerely condolonces to Steve Jobs, I will always remember you.
May you rest in peace! Your thinking truly enriched our lives!  My warmest condolences to the world you left behind.
I find it incredibly ironic that the day I learned how to use online library databases in my University from my Apple computer, and I took a study break to watch TV, that I learned of Steve's passing. I owe everything to this man, because without my personal computer, library research would be all but impossible. I remember saving all of my Christmas money and work money to buy my first iPod at age 16. It was the first generation video iPod. On long car trips, walks, a trip to Europe, I took it everywhere, and still take my nano to class and work. When I went to college, I chose a Mac because of its easy usage and great customer support. Four years later, I am still using this Mac, and tonight from the University of Minnesota I am writing and researching my college honors thesis. I don't have an iPhone, iPad, or many of the gadgets others use at this point in time; I'm quite old fashioned and prefer to read material books, not much for touch screens, etc. But it wasn't until today how I learned just how revolutionary the digital world can be, and I will always remember that Steve innovated my favorite calming device and researching tool. Even if I wasn't the nerdiest, tech-savvy girl out there, Steve had something to offer. Thanks so much for making my college life easier, less-stressful, and for opening a larger perspective of the world. 
Truly terrible news about Steve Jobs passing away. I realize that I never knew him but the truth is that his products he and his team have created have given me all the amazing opportunities in my life. They allowed me to express myself and my creativity along with millions of others. You will be missed Mr. Jobs! You did good, Mr. Jobs. Rest well.  I will miss you RIP and everyone please take a moment of silence for mister jobs and to show your respect. thank you for making peoples lives happy and enjoyable and loveable and  amazing with your amazing products. god be with you and bless you. we will miss you steve.
I am so saddened by this news. Steve has touched so many lives. I work daily with his great invention and he truly will be missed. My condolences go out to his family and friends. His visions and memories will live on forever. We will miss you!&nbsp;
I'm sad to know the death of Steve Job. I've started learning Multimedia art from 2001. Because of Final Cut  Pro, I've switched to Apple computer and quickly tasted the cleverness  of Apple machine and it's software. When I first time heard Keynotes of  Steve Job, I was overwhelmed by his soft-spoken speech. I have a Mac  computer, iPhone85 I'm living with his inventions. It is hard to hear  his death. His contribution had been so much to Multimedia artists and it is no  longer a specific field of people for Apple products. They support Art  and made art for everyone. He is one of the kind, who I am grateful living at the same time. His creative, innovative, leader of modern life style will never died. He will be keep living in my life. His ideas, styles, forever. Thank you, Steve Jobs.
I just would like to say Steve Jobs is an inspiration for everyone on the planet, and his visions have changed the world by advancing technology in a way most people cannot imagine. I will always remember his impact on this planet and everyone else should do the same.
As I type on this MacBook, my iPhone rings in the background, and from the corner of my desk my iPad sits in its dock watching my daily business routine. Before I remember Steve, I must thank him dearly. Thank you Mr. Jobs. Thank you for being the visionary and creative genius that you are, and for creating the future of innovations for years to come. Innovations that bring people, and businesses together like no one ever imagined. Thank you for making my life easier! I'm sure this was your plan all along, just so you could keep an eye on "iCloud" :) Sent from my iHeart 
Thank you Steve for the innovative things that have become an everyday part of life.  You will be missed but not forgotten.&nbsp;
Mr. Steve Jobs........ Thank you for always thinking out of the box and including us on your  adventures. Deepest condolences to Steve's  immediate family and to all who  partnered with him to make his visions a reality... Simply saying that  he will be missed is a huge understatement... Bravo Steve for leaving a foot print on this world that will never be  filled by anyone else... You own it! Peace...
 My condolences to Steve Jobs, we will remember him and his inspiration to this generation’s technology.&nbsp;
Thank you, I'm a fan of Apple. In the future, I will continue to be a fan of Apple. Thank you for the future.
It's amazing how profoundly I find myself affected by Steve's passing. A man I've never met has gone, and there is a sharp, palpable sense of emptiness. Like an empty auditorium - quiet, waiting for the speaker who is not coming.I am thankful for the passion Steve brought to all he did, and will forever be inspired. His work, not just at Apple, touched the lives of my entire family in ways we never would have imagined. Thank you, Steve... for everything.
Dear Apple Family, I'm writing to you from my Mac  with utter sadness. Steve has touched my life, career and family. The Apple products provided inspiration during my college years as I pondered which career I ultimately wanted to pursue. In 1991, while attending New York Institute of Technology, I registered for a graphic design class. The computer lab featured the latest Apple computers, thus inspiring me to continue in the field of Advertising then Art Therapy. Throughout my career, my design concepts were enhanced by Apple's products. I also created art for my patients in order to promote the benefits of art as therapy for those with mental illness. When I got engaged, in 2007, I purchased an iphone for my fiance as his engagement present. He was thoroughly distracted for months, but able to put it down on our wedding day :). The iphone became an asset for his entrepreneurial venture. We built our business plan, promotions and website on the Mac and continue to enjoy your products. Steve, I thank you for your dedication to innovation, creativity and communication. My sincerest sympathy to the Jobs family.
There are no words really as I sit here with my beautiful Apple. Thank  you Steve for a life long love of Apple. 1984 will forever be the year  my family took me to the LA Olympics and the year we bought our first  Apple computer - have never looked back since. Blessed be to all at Apple and know that you are not alone in mourning  the passing of a wonderful visionary.&nbsp;
what a visionary, he did amazing things that nobody else couldve done.  he saw things that no one else coulve seen. rest in peace steve. 
So sad to hear...I listen to my iPod everyday..that's only one way he changed technology.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
 The world is a better place because of you.&nbsp;You have left a wonderful legacy for us all to enjoy and celebrate.   You may have left us in the physical world but your spirit and profound accomplishments will be with us Forever....&nbsp;
This is probably the first time I am in contact with a company to send my&nbsp;condolences for the death of a person I never met.&nbsp;I just want to say how much I admire Steve Jobs' work. The products Mr. Jobs  and Apple have developed  over the past years have changed the world. The way we listen to music, how we communicate, what products we use to create art and many other things will keep Mr. Jobs' fingerprint for many years.
Thank you Steve for your life, vision, and drive which inspired us all  how think different and move beyond our boundaries to become more than  we never thought possible.  May God bless and keep you throughout all  eternity and also bring comfort and strength to your family, friends,  and the many millions who loved you. Blessings
Steve, I will miss you forever... You were an amazing man and you have made countless people happy and their lives better. I commend you for everything you have done. I respect you for your concerns about the environment. I hope(I know ) that you are resting in peace in heaven. I'm sure the values you have bestowed into Tim C. And Apple will continue to flourish in your memory. You are  a Great man and because of your device, the first iPhone, I gave me something good to distract me from my own losses... My Brother. It was something that made me happy in times of such grief - I enjoyed listening music, watching YouTube videos and laughed, I learned from it too, it's the first thing I turn to when I want to find and figure something out. I always turn to my iPhone. So without further saying more, I thank you for everything you've done from the bottom of my Heart.&nbsp;
Thanks for creating this wonderful Apple world for us. May you be in peace forever!&nbsp;
I remember sitting beside my dad who brought this beige box home in 1978.  It was an Apple+, and Steve had had helped launch the home personal computer revolution.  Everything before this was a console.  This was programmable.  It connected to the TV, and I watched him zap aliens... and saw him write code. ...and I started my occupation from the desire to code on that old Apple 2.&nbsp;
My prayers and thoughts are with family and friends of Steve. Truly an amazing man.  With heartfelt sympathy
Dear Steve u are the best, first I must say no one could have built the world of technology but u. And still I use the iPods n my iPhone, but everytime I  use them I think what's the use of using a device u invented without u by my side. But now I no that u never left us. U not only live in our hearts but  in those devices that u had created too.... U will never be forgeted. Apple  the best of the best, and will always be the best, finally I must say if it  was not for u the present technology would be non other than the past. Hope  u understand how I feel                                        From: a great fan of apple and Steve jobs&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened to hear of Mr. Job's passing. The lives of our entire family have been enriched by Steve's genius. He will be remembered by history along side Da Vinci, Einstein, Edison and Ford. The world has lost the greatest human of our times.&nbsp;
To an innovator, a genius, a leader and the best nerd one aspires to be!  Each time you spoke you carried the future in every breath and carried hopes and dreams into our homes. Our present would not be so if it were not for you. And our future will surely be at a loss without you.  You will be missed but will live on in my iMac, my MacBook Pro circa 2007 and my MacBook Pro circa 2010, iPad 2 and now soon to be my family of 3 iPhone 4S.....
My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends in this difficult   time.  He will not be forgotten.&nbsp;
True visionaries are rare and we lost one of the most important ones the  world has seen in many a year. My prayers  go out to his family and  friends.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Thank you Steve Jobs! You will be missed!</div>
Since I was a little kid, Steve showed me the way to a new vision. He walked  with me during my studies and help me get through difficult situations by giving beautiful music to my ears. He was aside on boredom and pain and always was a cause to not give up and continuing walking hard... I'll miss you everyday. Goodbye uncle Steve....   
Thank you Steve !!  RIP 
A true innovator. We are fortunate to have lived in his time. Thank You Steve! My thoughts are with your family during this difficult time.May You Rest in Peace.
What a visionary. My 10 year old son keeps asking me when I got my first  phone? When did I get my first iTouch? My first iMac? I still can't  believe it was not that long ago that we did not have any of the  innovative life changing technology.  And, without the vision of Steve,  we (and our children) would not have evolved to were we are today. Let's  keep Steve's spirit and continue into the future.&nbsp;

Steve was a role model to high school kids like me. We were interested in tech but needed something that would be fun and be able to show off to the friends what we did. He created the iPhone we created apps for our everyday life.&nbsp; Thanks Steve Jobs
Sitting here thinking about your remarkable services. Hard to say anything....  I just say thank you for many of support for my life.  Again, Thank you Steve and Apple Crew.
I took this news harder than I expected.  I thought I was having a bad day, until I got home and was using my iMac and this news popped up on my screen.  Thanks Steve for everything…you have made my life better far more than you knew.  May your family be at peace during this time and your company continue your legacy.&nbsp;
Para muchos es un ejemplo de trabajo y lucha por cambiar a cosas inimaginables.&nbsp;
Steve.  Your wisdom and inspiration will carry on forever in the dreams of those whose lives you have changed with your knowledge and courage to follow your own dreams. Thank you for every idea you worked to create and for the lives you unknowingly changed with them. You will be here forever in those ideas. Thank you and God bless your amazing life and soul!!
Dear Apple,     I’ve never used a single piece of your product…              But I’m wowed by how your products change the world…     I’ve never ever met Mr. Jobs…              But I admired his struggle, from childhood to adulthood, with my heart….     So today, shocked by his departure…              I send this mail. Not to bring any message, just to say that I’ll miss him..     Just like any other human fellows will miss him.     Thank you Steve, for everything, Rest In Peace.
 The world will miss you so much!&nbsp;
Steve I never got to meet you but you surely inspired me to reach for my dreams. You showed the world that the impossible was indeed possible, so long as you believed in your ideas and in the people around you, anything is possible.  You have changed the world for the better and I thank you for that.  To all of you who knew and worked with Steve I am sorry for your loss, and I  am confident that you will continue to inspire, create and innovate. The face of Apple may have faded but his spirit will live on forever in all of tho se that he has touched.  Thank you Steve I will miss you.
Steve really changed the way we have improved in our every day lives.  The world is definetely immeasurably better because of Steve.  He's a true visionary, who will be missed!  My thoughts go out to his wife, his family, friends and loved ones.&nbsp;
To Steve's family and Friends... my thoughts are with Steve's family at this time. I am very sorry for your loss. he certainly was a genius and i am sure an incredible human being. may peace be with you. all my love
An immense loss to the world of technology. Condolences to the Steve´s family. 
My first real "tech" job was selling Macintosh computers in our university book store. I am now the Director of Infrastructure for a large online media company and I owe my passion for technology to that smiling face that greeted me every time I started my computer up. Thank you Steve Jobs for what you gave me.&nbsp;
Steve, You made it possible for me to be the artist today at 44 years old that I dreamed of becoming in 3rd grade. You helped me see the world and make it a better place with an art degree, not a computer science degree. You made mistakes, but you were human. You were rich, but you still shared with the world. You started with nothing and made something. You won and you lost. You won bigger and you failed bigger. But in the end you gave the world your vision to run with and make its own. You triumphed. And you will be missed.&nbsp;
Thank you for showing us that things can be so simple. And beautiful. And intelligent. Heaven is for sure a much better place now. Love and piece for you, your family and friends.
 I can´t believe than this genious is dead.  When I remenber my first ipod, I remenber Steve Jobs. He was a genious, the world will never see someone like him. I admire too Steve Jobs, because he was a tireless person. I know that he sold his car to finance the founding of Apple  and that is worthy of admiration.  I have 15 years, and as an adult, I want to change the world as he did. Steve Jobs: thanks for existing.&nbsp;
Rest in Peace Steve.
 Guys, I never thought I could feel so sad about the death of someone I've never met in person. I can't imagine how his family and friends must be feeling, I send all of them my condolences and love. Steve gave all of us 56 years of nothing but genius, and for that, the world will always be thankful, and the world will never forget him. RIP Steve. Not just a genius and an icon, but a remarkable human being.&nbsp;
He Will live forever in our hearts because he is the best man of this World . ...  Still with us  Forever Steve Jobs   
Dear Steve,  Thank you for the Macbook Pro on which I am writing this. Thank you for the iPad on which I learned of and read about your passing.  Without your inspiration and persistence and belief in your company's ability to triumph depute all the odds against, I would not have had the chance to experience the simple wow when I discover new things on buying one of your products.  Thank you for working to make Apple grow and grow despite what must have been a very painful time personally.  Here's to the brave one who never gave up.  With real love, - a recent but abiding, Apple devotee 
I never thought much about the man until I watched his Stanford speech, which I found truly inspiring... My most sincere condolences go out to his family and friends.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs, Thank you for everything you did. Thank you for Pixar, thank you for made Toy Story part of my childhood. Thank you for Apple, thank you for made a revolution and a evolution technological. Wherever you are, stay good. We miss you.
Hey Steve!  Vaya con Dios, suerte en el siguente viaje!  Alla nos vemos!&nbsp;
He was a great man, his work inspired many, his vision change the World. Rest In Peace.
After 25 years of living the "Spirit of Apple", I can't face Steve's departure without expressing my sadness with sincere tears.  You've been more than a 'famous name' in the computer industry.  For "the rest us", Steve, you've been a friend, an example, an icon, and many other figures and symbols capable of building a meaningful portion of our lives.  I'm 50 years old, and for half of my life I've been fascinated and delighted by the creations you contributed most, which also helped me so much in my professional career.  How can we forget you, Steve? Those who've never lived the "Spirit of Apple"can't undersand, but I'm sure I'm sharing the feelings of "the rest of us".  Thanks again, Steve, your light shines still, it's in these products, in the people who use them, and in all those who knew you and appreciated your wit, your commitment and your courage. 
an amazing person who will be missed by all.  So sorry he had to leave  so soon.  God bless. 
I had thought it was all hype but Apple's products changed my expectations of how devices should be. He was a brilliant man. I am a fan. RIP Steve Jobs. My deepest condolences to his family and friends.&nbsp;
Steve jobs was a visionary and changed the technological world with  great inventions and advances in technology that will only continue to  pull us further. He will be dearly missed.  
You were not only a great leader but a true inspiration. I'm glad I was able  to live in these times and be part of this generation that witnessed your m agic.  Thank you Steve for not letting us settle and always thrive for the best
now that Steve Jobs has left the building permanently.... his legacy, his passion for excellence, and his brilliant ideas to the future was back with ou r creator. He never, ever deprived us of sharing his innovations during his existence... you're always be remembered... my deepest sympathy to apple comp any and to all apple lovers you've left behind like me...
The world lost a great Man... A visionary and responsible for the best creations of our modern world. Rest In peace... And my sincere condolences to the family Jobs and the world...&nbsp;
Steve Jobs had a drive to innovate and make great things because that's how geniuses tick. What set him apart was his commitment to bringing his innovations to everyone, because that's who great things should be for.  When I wake up in the morning, one of the first things I see is his quote: "Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me ... Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful... that's what matters to me." Since I began applying that philosophy to everything I do - professionally, personally - I've found things tend to work out ok.  Thanks, Steve. Thanks for giving me great technologies to use, and even better wisdom to follow and share.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve  From México  We Miss You
My first computer that I ever touched was an Apple II E. Mr. Jobs truly paved the way for technology and to give the competitors something to compete with. My prayers go out to his family. God Bless you.&nbsp;
Too soon you left, yet so, you change the world and I thank you for that! God bless you Steve Jobs
The world will never be the same without you. &nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You were the greatest visionary and dreamer of our generation . You   transformed our lives in ways in ways no one else would have even   conceived. Your passing away will leave a huge void but your legacy   will live on forever.  RIP Mr Genius!  My best to your near and dear ones.&nbsp;
My condolences to Steve's family and his extended family (those extraordinary folks at Apple).&nbsp; I have several Apple products and love them.&nbsp; Somehow, I think everyone with an Apple product feels connected to Steve Jobs.  
I would like to express my sincere sympathy to the family and friends of Steve who knew him so well.  While this news saddens us greatly, we are forever thankful for the impact that Steve made on our lives, and the example he set to seek more out of life.  In a way, he was the friend of the many people who followed him, but who never even met him.  I personally feel as though I have lost a dear friend, one who's only passion was to make the world a better place.  We will all miss you Steve, and we will not forget you.&nbsp;
I'll forever be in debt to Steve Jobs for having the vision to create   a machine able to change ideas into reality. My first Apple inspired   me to take my love for art and make it my career when I truly didn't   know where my life was going. I honestly think it is because of my   time on an Apple that I choose to become a graphic designer. It's   truly a sad day and my thoughts and prayers are with his friends and   family. Steve... You'll be missed.
MY THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH HIS FAMILY. GOD BLESS HIM APPLE  WILL   NEVER BE THE SAME WITHOUT HIM BUT IM SURE HE LEFT  THEM IN THE RIGHT PATH  TO  CONTINUE TO DOMINATE TECHNOLIGY AND CONTINUE TO IMPROVE. DIDN'T KNOW HIM   PESONALLY BUT I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG FOR A WHILE AND HE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD MAN   AGAIN GODBLESS. MY CONDOLENCES........
You were one of the most inspiring people in my time!! A pioneer that did amazing things others could not have even imagined!! Your passion never died.. . And never will... Your legacy will  still continue to change people's&nbsp;<div>live's, as it has changed mine!! Thank you... Rest in peace!&nbsp;</div>
 Steve Job you was a person that change our life to be more easily and practice , my condolences to his family and R.I.P. genie of the technology             
Thank you for your contributions to our world.  Your entrepreneurial spirit will never be forgotten.  My condolences to your family (thank you for sharing Steve with the world).&nbsp;
 You are a creative genius and you will never be forgotten, you inspire me.&nbsp;
To Steve, RIP my friend. When I heard that you left us the only thing I said was thank you lord for a great visionary.  My thoughts and prays go out to Steve's family and friends all around the world. <br>
I wasn't even an idea yet when Apple was founded. But I'll never forget the way Mr. Jobs and his company revolutionized technology and the world during my lifetime. It's truly sad to see him pass on. I just wish Apple continues with his enthusiasm and grace in his honour. 
Thank you for showing the world how it should be done. You'll be missed.&nbsp;
Steve, you will be greatly missed.  I am currently a sophomore in high school and have been inspired by you.   My dream job is to be a worker at Apple (preferably a board member) and  I am currently looking into colleges that have majors in Computers.  I  have watched many of your keynote presentations and was always  fascinated by your products.  The way you presented the products and how  you kept them a secret made me want to join the team at Apple.  I know  you are gone, but your legacy at Apple will live on.
i only has the pleasure of working for steve tangentially .. but i felt fortunate just to be apart it .. so truly sad to see him go .. things just will not be the same .. it's the end of an era ..   my sincerest condolences to all of steve's family and friends ..  
Steve Jobs was a brilliant man, an incredible person and his passing is a tremendous loss for the world. He changed the world as we know it. Shine on Steve! <br>
I worked for four months at a market research company doing half-hour   surveys to afford my first MacBook Pro. I watched the keynotes live,   and have bought five Apple products thus far. Steve Jobs isn't just a   successful entrepreneur; he's a cult icon that will live in the   thoughts of the world. 
Steve, you will be remembered forever, your vision and innovations has made a  better world. 
We always lose the great ones from this world too early, thank you Steve Jobs for your amazing creations and for making this world so much better. Thoughts and Prayers are with your family.
Steve was a fresh inspiration and motivation for me. He has shown me to trust my gut feeling and instinct and always pick myself up whenever I fall.  He will be deeply missed.&nbsp;
You changed the world Steve Jobs.  History will see you as Edison,  Einstein.  A true hero to us all.  Godspeed.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an absolute legend in the world of technology. I never knew him personally, but the news of his death definitely shocked and saddened me. He was a kind and gregarious man who many will miss. My thoughts and condolences are with his family.  
Steve,  I just found out a couple minutes ago. I'll write something more   lengthy later on burn for now, I hope you're in a better place. Always   know that you were admired and respected. However, for me and millions   of others, you were much more than that.  You were both an   inspirational and aspirational hero. You were the greatest Pirate of   Silicon Valley ;-) In fact if Silicon Valley were a pirate ship, then   you would be the Captain. For all that and more, I think I speak on   behalf of computer nerds like me when I say, thank you. Farewell, old   friend. We will miss you and will always continue to ask, WWSD...What   Would Steve Do?&nbsp;
Terribly sorry to hear of the loss. Not only has Steve been an amazing  start-up business creator by starting Apple in a garage, but he has  since proven to be a mastermind at innovation. His creativeness and  brilliance will never again be repeated in the world, from thinking up  the first generation iPhone in 2007 to the latest of his iconic handset,  the iPhone 4S. Such a great person will not be forgotten quickly. Rest in Peace and good luck to Apple as a whole.
I  just wanted to add my thoughts to (I'm sure) the countless others. The  countless emails his death will generate speaks volumes to Steve's  impact on the world. I'm confident that he will be mourned more than any  other CEO in modern times. I just wanted to let Steve know that he's  been with me my whole life and that is likely to continue until mine  ends too. You lived well, set the bar high, and have impacted us all.  What an example to help guide me down my own path. 
Rest in peace Steve, always remembered! May the iCloud welcome you as you deserve!
My ultimate ambition was to eventually work for the man who inspired me to 1. Graduate from High School 2. Attend College 3. Touch people in the way that he did. He will live forever in the hearts of all mankind.
I remember buying my first iPod in 2002 just before starting my freshman year of college, 3,000 miles from home.  I didn't understand how incredible it was until the first time I put it on and walked to class. It kept me company through my four years of college and beyond, through runs, long walks, airplane rides, a summer in London, trips across the world, moments of sadness and joy, and when I just needed to be alone. I'm on iPod #3, and 9 years later I still revel at how perfect it is. It takes a visionary to create a product that is so simple yet so advanced that it actually changes an industry. Steve Jobs did it time and time again.  The world isn't quite as bright without him in it.
Thank you for making me passionate about technology. You have left a huge imprint on the world. We will still be talking about you for many many years to come. Amazing products. Amazing man.&nbsp;
I wish to extend my sincerest sympathy to the family, friends and colleagues  of Steve Jobs. The world will proclaim that it has lost a true visionary whose impact on technology will forever be etched into the pages of history. A man who inspired generations and will no doubt continue to do so as far into the future as any of us can see. But some people lost a father, brother, husband and friend. To you guys I am truly sorry for your loss. Steve was an inspirational figure and a truly unique architect of the computing revolution. I love computers, it's what I do for a living and I love my Apple products. Thank you Steve for all the work you done. You will be missed  but more importantly you will never be forgotten. God bless and rest in peace. Deepest sympathy. 
You were one of the greatest leaders in the technological world. Thanks to you I am able to write this email from a wonderful device known as the ipad2. Thanks Steve for all your contributions...RIP&nbsp;
God bless you Steve, you are amazing!   Thank you for all of your inspiration and for changing the world in many ways.
Steve Jobs was one of my big inspirations growing up as a kid obsessed with computers in the 1980s. I was inspired by the way he kept talking about how he wanted to "build things." I brought a book of his biography with me to college, and I grew up to become a computer scientist.&nbsp;
Please accept my sympathies on the death of Steve Jobs who was my inspiring mentor.
The man was a genius. He and Apple completely changed the way we communicate with each other over the last 30 years. His vision and technology succeeded in making the world a smaller, more connected place. Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs. You have truly left your legacy on this world in a big, big way.&nbsp;
Rest In Peace, Steve. You will be missed. You changed our lives and the world forever.
The World has lost a genius
As much as I didn't want to face how close this time was to be, my biggest concern was for his creative child: Apple. Steve was a Giant among dwarfs in his and many other corporate arenas. Steve was the epitome of  what we could each be via what America offered to all those who have come to the New World to seek their fortunes and follow their dreams. Steve is our shining example of what capitalism is and what it can do for our countrymen.  I am praying to our God that his leadership continue to grow his legacy by following his example in moral, creative, and economic business sense so that his spirit will continue to be a guiding light for Apple and those who follow. Please accept my deepest sympathy and heartfelt sadness for your loss of a family member, friend, and leader. I pray God brings you peace and strength to follow through according to Steve Jobs' wishes.
 Feeling deep sorrow about losing a great human being. Steve Jobs rest in peace. 
 My sincerest condolences to Mr. Jobs' family, friends, and his Apple family.  I am saddened for our loss, so saddened. This is OUR loss because my typing  on my iPad right now, or using my iPhone right now is  is an imprint of his  influence. No one has influenced me more just by giving a speech or introdu cing a product. No other CEO has made me excited about spending money. I own  many of his products--iMac, iPhones, iPod touches, and the iPad to name a few. I am pretty sure we own all of his Pixar films. I was excitedly having the conversation with co- workers about getting  the new iphone 4S. What I love about these products is it's more than the fact that its a product, his products are an experience. He changed the game by making it cool to pay for music when music was being heavily shared peer to peer. He made technology cool and attractive. Steve Jobs is incredible to me. I never met him but my respect for him and his innovation is tremendous.  My admiration for his contributions to our lives is beyond words. I'm in IT and we have our heroes and he is that person for many of us.  We have lost a visionary like no other, but need to celebrate his global impact.
I Remember When My Mom Bought Me My First iPod Touch. I Was Just Amazed At What A Creative Person Could Come Up With. It Changed The Way I Used Electronics And How I Looked At Them. He Created A New Way Of How To Use Technology. He Will Be Missed R.I.P. Steve Jobs
 I'm from Brazil, 61 years old, and I have much to thank Mr. Jobs for all his  inventions and for his exemplary life. God bless him and comfort his family. I will pray for him ! THANK YOU, Steve Jobs!!! &nbsp;
Steve changed the world with his innovative mind.  He took a company that was dead and made it the Worlds most valuable company in 2011. The technology has touched every aspect of our lives in one way or another whether you are a fanboy or a hater.  He will be missed and will not be matched. RIP Steve 
You will be missed. You are such a brilliant guy! If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have my iPod, and my dad wouldn't have his iPhone or iPad. Apple is soooo great, and I promise you'll go right to heaven. You made our world better.
Steve,   You were an inspiration and a visionary that the world will never forget.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs' products have changed my life, and the movies his company  created are among my favorites. Thank you to all the good people now and  formerly at Apple and Pixar, and thank you Steve Jobs. For everything  you've done. 
Steve may be the only mortal who, when he arrives into heaven, has a chance to improve it. Thank you Steve and Thank you Apple for your passion for humanity and effort to provide us all with better tools to make our own small marks upon the world. 
What a terrible loss. This is my personal and belated Thank You for everything Steve's done that's touched and changed my life, starting with the Apple ][+ I learned to program on, all the way to the MacBook Air I use today, and the Pixar films I take my kids to. Someone else said it better:  "Who will defend us from Mediocrity now?"&nbsp;
I am writing this on my mac book with an iPhone to the left of it and a shuffle that I use for working out to the right.  That statement alone shows the impact that Steve Jobs and Apple have had on my every day life. Thanks for everything, you are an inspiration and will be missed.&nbsp;
Obviously genius, this man changed the world for the better. He will  leave an incredible legacy I can only admire. I am grateful to have  lived during his lifetime.
I never met the man or heard him speak in person, however I believe the world has lost a great man.  Steve Jobs changed my life for the better by allowing me to enjoy technology and not fight with it. 
 Dear Steve, Thanks to your great re-inventions all the time. Your inspiring dreams on earth have been realised and applauded by many!  You made a difference in my life, definitely and positively! 
Because of you, I think different. Thank you. 
Dear Steve and Apple Team,&nbsp;Thank you for the magnificent way in which you connected the world by using your creative genius and thus opening the door to what is possible if we dare to make our dream into reality. &nbsp;Steve, you will be missed by the world.  Eternal blessings.  With much sympathy for all your loved ones. &nbsp;
It’s a sad day... Just want to pass on my condolences to Steve’s family and his friends at Apple, he will be missed but his memory will live on in his products. R.I.P Steve! 
 As a user of only Apple computers since my first Mac 1984, I came to   appreciate the elegance and style matched to the performance of   Apple's products, which was so evident to me, and was surprised that   most people didn't "get it". It has been known for some time that Steve was the force that kept it   all together and made it happen. What can I say but THANK YOU STEVE for changing our lives, and may you   rest in peace, and of course I send my sincerest condolences to his   family, friends, and co-workers at apple.&nbsp;
My deep condolences to Steve's Family, Partners and Friends. I personally did not know Steve Jobs. But to all of you who did, just by knowing that he was part of the great family of Apple and a foundation of this genious generation of technology, I strongly accompany all on your feelings. To me, life since I got Apple has never been the same... In all aspects; as a student, professional, mother, friend, etc. Because all of this new gadgets and software have made my life easier an more fun. Therefore I want to thank Steve for all of his work, ideas and effort to help make it happen. And farewell to an amazing human being.&nbsp;
Thanks for your being hungry and being foolish... i know that your teachings will never be forgotten 
Although it seemed to be coming, it feels so sudden.  Such a tragic loss. I am very sad. 
Mr. Jobs: I never met you personally, but you inspired me through your persistence  for excellence.
 An incredible human being.  One we will all remember with awe and envy.  What a life.  What a contribution to the world!            
You are an inspiration for me to be a great entrepreneur. You change the world with your excellent imagination. Rest in peace... 
My very first computer was the first iMac model and technology has  enhanced my life since in thoughtful and creative growth. Steve Jobs has certainly been an influence in and of my life and I have  enormous respect for his vision and generosity. I think we all share a more creative future from him. Missed and remembered. 
I'm so sad tonight. RIP Steve jobs. You'll have forever all my admiration. You changed my life since i discover iMac for my artwork. I'm an admirer of you vision, ambition, strength... I never forget you. I will think always different... &nbsp;
Steve was a great man he made computers what they are today because of his invention the Macintosh he made computers great. He was my hero I'm 14 and Steve was the best I will miss Steve
Dear, Mr.Jobs, My first personal computer was a Mac. My first portable music player was iPod. Also when writing a paper, also when taking an entrance examination, and also when it participates in the first full marathon in life and participates in an important friend's marriage ceremony, the Apple products which Jobs made were still next to me. And still all the time. Thank you, Jobs....Please sleep peacefully.
There is nothing I can think at this time. The world has lost a great man, a true visionary, artist and businessman. RIP Steve, one day I will name my child by your name.&nbsp;
 Goodbye Mr Jobs, your life is an inspiration, we will miss you and live to tell your stories to our kids.
no doubt millions upon millions of people will do this, however i feel i must also. Thanks for changing the way we do things, the way we work, making so many people happy and pushing all the boundaries. I hope your legacy lives on and on. You were a true legend and visionary. REST IN PEACE STEVE.
I am greatly sadden to hear of this news of Steves passing and Wish his family and friends the Best in these times. Always remember you as a great man with a open heart. He treated people fair and pushed them to excel in their field making us all better. 
To Steve Jobs, his family, friends, and the world, I grew up with his products in the early 80's and have loved every part of my Apple experience.  I am passing this same love to my 4 kids.  Thanks Steve  for how you have improved our world.
Steve Jobs, a modern day Leonardo DaVinci, has died. Visionary, intuitive, mercurial and one of the few tech guys who had the taste and restraint to know what not to put into products. When thinking about his legacy, I envision all the little kids I see today who try to mutli-touch on any flat screen display they see, and marvel at the future Steve has opened up to them. Thank you Steve for the modern world and for the world to come. 
I really loved Steve Jobs' inspiration he made to us and how great all of his technology things were. The first time I heard that he was dead i was shocked literately. It was a shocking news to all of my family too. I loved him as much as I think you guys did he was an amazing person I could ever know in histories of people. When I heard he made the iPhone4S I really wanted to make him another version of the iPhone too. It sounded to me like he really said he just had to finish his project. I really think he was an amazing person and even years and centuries goes I think he will still be in our history known as the greatest technology inventor and a founder  of the Apple.  I think its really hard to move on without him but I always hope that you will make another phone, pad and i phones. Even he isn't here i know he will always and forever watching us from the cloud. &nbsp;
I met Steve at the grand opening of the Apple Store on 5th Avenue. What  do you say to a man of great vision? I shook his hand and said, "It's a  pleasure." It was a pleasure, Steve. A pleasure to live in your time.&nbsp;
Great man, my prayers are with your family, you'll be greatly missed
Thank you for forever changing my life.. You will forever be missed.. Rest with the angels!&nbsp;
Steve I'll miss you, you were a man who revolutionized the world with your products  and changed the way we communicate and listen to music, I hope you are in a  better place.&nbsp;
 i have my second business thanks to you, and products that work, i hope to see you on the next level.             
I can't even begin to tally the incredible number of ways in which Steve Jobs and Apple have had a positive impact on my life and that of my family.  For over 25 years, I've experienced innumerable pleasures and accomplished great things all because of the ideas and products that grew out of Steve's unique perspective and creativity. And I am just one example among millions.  We will all miss him very much, and we are incredibly grateful for what he did for all of us.&nbsp;
Sorry for the biggest lost of all computer industry times. I have grown up look up to Steve's accomplishments. I am proud to use his innovation in an industry I have spent most of my  life working with. I have seen the personal computer progress from its start. My sincere condolences.
The death of such a man is a shock to all that hears of it. Upon hearing the news of his death I was immediately struck with a sense of loss myself. Not knowing him personally and not knowing him at all in the personal sense I still felt like the world was a little bit sadder. We all lost someone today that cared about the people. His life was not for success but for those who could benefit from his works of art. I give my condolences to his wife and his family and I hope that everything will come and go as peacefully and tranquilly as possible. Be well relatives, friends, and wife of Mr. Steve Jobs, we will all remember the great things he does but also remember him for the man he was. A man of greatness but also a man of kindness.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for giving me the last computer I will ever own. I  should have bought one a long time ago.  As I get older, computers need  to get simpler to operate and you have done that. My condolences to the Jobs family. You couldn't ask for a better role  model. The world will miss Steve Jobs immensely.&nbsp;
Dear Apple Team, I would like to share my thoughts with you. When I saw Steve´s speech at stanford on youtube I thought, somehow, he was also talking about me. I dropped out of college in New Jersey and that also was the best thing that ever happened to me. I didnt know what to do and my parents cut me out- I had a couple of bucks in my pocket and, since I am peruvian who went to school to play soccer,  I was facing a visa status change to "ilegal " I couldn't return home because I had this feeling I wasted a lot of my parents money in a college not only I didnt finished, but I also didnt care about. So I decided to stay in the US. I moved to Virginia and started working in a restaurant. I started as a busboy and ended up as an assistant manager. I loved the restaurant life and I fell in love with the kitchen It´s been 7 years now and after working with many important chefs in the Washington DC area, I returned to Peru were I´m finishing my cuisine diploma at Le Cordon Bleu Peru  and I am also opening my own restaurant at the end of this month. So I guess the dots conected somehow. From Lima, Peru Good bye and Thank you Steve Jobs!&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs inspired me, my husband and our children to be more than average. &nbsp;Apple products are woven into each of our lives. &nbsp;We offer&nbsp;condolences&nbsp;and&nbsp;solace&nbsp;to his family. Thanks Steve for everything!
 I want to offer my condolences to Mr. Jobs, his family, and his friends. May  he rest in peace.
We will forever be grateful for his revolutionary vision. Our prayers go out to his family, friends and collegues.
Thank you Steve. I am proud to say to have lived in the time of Steve Jobs. God bless. Our condolences and prayers to the family.&nbsp;
 Mr.Jobs,      You changed the world in many ways. You will be remembered not only for the things you created, but also the people you inspired. I am typing this from a PC, which shows that you have not only touched the lives of people who used your product, but people in general. You will be missed.
I personaly think steve jobs is the reason macs are so neatly made and  look so elegant, he is the reason a mac looks good when a musician uses  it on stage or a teacher uses it in her class macs, iPods and iPhones  are amazing creation of a man who was obsessed with improving mankind,  great loss and i will forever miss him. 
I would like to share my condolences with Steve Jobs family, and friends. He was the most inspirational man I have ever seen in my lifetime. I am hurt that we have lost such an amazing ingenious man. I am proud to work for the company that he has turned into an empire. I want to thank him for making such a revolutionary company that has given so many of us great, life enriching jobs. I will remember steve for the rest of my time and tell his amazing story. I will be celebrating him on launch day October 14th with my apple family at retail store R191. This will be the most memorable launch in my history of working for apple, all in honor of the great Steve Jobs. Once again I send all of my love to his family members and friends, you are all in my thoughts and prayers.
This is incredibly sad. My sincere condolences to his family. I hope they find the strength to get through&nbsp;this tough period. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
...some people increase the tragic gap between what we are and what we could be as humans. 
The first computer at my home was an Apple II my father allowed me to play with. Steve Jobs was a visionary, but a very practical producer who payed special attention to the human being as a fluid user. I hope this halt moment of reflexion will give us all the good will to understand the real problems and challenges we are facing today and will face tomorrow. You are one contributor who made my personal world and universe better. I will miss you in a very good way. Rest in peace Steve Jobs. 
My most sincere condolences to all members of the Jobs family, and to the Apple family.&nbsp;Steve is irreplaceable but I believe his spirit will continue in Apple's products and services.&nbsp;He really changed the world and the way we think, the way we use things, the way we interact with technology, the way we purchase and the way we live. I've never followed a company liked I followed (and still will) Apple before. Steve had me on the edge of my chair every time when new products where coming out. I loved his keynote speeches. The world has lost one of the most innovative minds in history. May he rest in peace. &nbsp;
Nothing of apple would be possible without you. Thank you for all that you'v e done. We love you. Rest in peace.
Steve Jobs...... He helped to change the world into a better place. I think few present past and future can or will carry that distinction. I look forward to the many ways that Apple will continue that legacy. My condolences to all his family and friends.
I can only say that we all take our paths, we end up where we are supposed to be.  We were blessed to be born in this time where someone with such brilliance could have such a profound impact on so many. He will be missed and yet not because there is so much around us reflective of the great vision he had. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an inspiring mentor not only to those who knew him, but for all those seeking an example of resilience and perseverance - a huge loss for our generation and others to come. 
An outstanding and visionary man. He was not only a creative mind, but also a leader in the search of providing excellence in service and products, taking care of the most minimal detail. RIP wherever you are Steve and thanks for everything you did. My condolences to Steves family and to Apple.&nbsp;
My condolences to Steve's family and friends. There is a massive hole in the  techno-world today. The man truly did change the world.&nbsp;
You will be missed.  You wanted to change the world and your did.  Few people in this life can say that. 
It was a very sad evening tonight when we heard of Steve Jobs passing. I cry now as I type this. He was such a business genius and that will be sorely missed. How can anyone imagine life without an Apple product?&nbsp; He invented our dreams. I use his products everyday and could not imagine technology without his inventions in the landscape. His imagination will be left on the world forever - he changed the world.&nbsp; How many of us can say we did that? My prayers to his family and friends during this time.&nbsp; Thank you for the life you lived - it touched us all.
Hello! I'm writing from Chile, I want to give my condolences to Steve's family, friends and co-workers. I know how it is to lose someone of cancer. My father died this year on july 2, he lasted 11 months from the day with got the diagnose. He was only 51 years old. I know the pain you're feeling, and I'm sharing it with all of you. My blessings and only God and time will give you the strength and peace to carry on.&nbsp;
A non musician that made me like the music... A Genius of our generation... A prophet that led us to future... That's Steve Jobs, a bright star for 56 years and forever alive in our hearts. R.I.P Steve Jobs 1955-2011 
RIP Steve Jobs. You are always loved by all your millions and millions of Apple fans. To me at least, no one can be as creative as you. Technology becomes amazing in your hands and today the world lost you. But we will never forget you.
It was early January 2001, the day itunes was announced. I was heading  back to IL1 after dinner, it was around 8pm. I decided to take the  elevator, as the door was just about to close; I heard, "hold the  elevator" and so I did. Steve skipped into the elevator with a look of  excitement about him not dissimilar to a child on Christmas morning. We stood facing each other, I congratulated Steve on his keynote and the  launch of itunes earlier that day. Internally at Apple the goal was to  have a lot more songs available but the process back then was manual, and therefore we couldn't get to the total that  Steve wanted. Nonetheless Steve was obviously very excited about what  the launch of itunes meant. In a way, Steve was the only person on the planet at that moment who  truly realized what had just occurred. He had single handily changed the  way we purchase and listen to music and also the way the music business  is run. He was back at work that night, the same day that he launched  the itunes service. Working on making it a reality for everyone else not  just him. To me this was Steve, always turned on, somewhat quirky, and  hard working. Farewell Steve, you may be gone but your spirit, passion and originality  will live on.
Steve wasn't just "one" of the biggest inspirations in my life, he was the biggest inspiration in my life. His relentless search for perfection changed my life and the life of millions around the globe. Steve's soul will live on in every Macintosh, every iPod, iPad and iPhone that apple produce, and of course apple itself. My most sincere condolences to his family and friends. Goodbye Steve, we wil l miss you.
            While most people just talk and dream about it, you TRULY DID change the world. Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;
   First and foremost I would like to thank you Steve Jobs. All the wonderful and productive devices I use, exist because of you. The measure of a mans life comes in the reaction of others and there's no question reactions are abound. I'm sure your ambiance will be felt in every apple product and in the effect you've had on every apple employee. I don't think I've ever been as saddened at the loss of a prominent figure as I am today. Years and years will certainly progress and you'll always be remembered, nobody can ask anymore of ones life than that..... R.I.P. Steve jobs My best wishes to his family. 
All the back to my elementary days in the 80's I remember using the floppy disc and lookin at the rainbow stripped apple on the monitor. Your resurgence  of the iPod, iPhone, and all of Apple products I am a proud owner I  Thank you Steve you have done such a great Job!!!  Now rest you have lived beyond the dreams of a true genius! Your my HERO&nbsp;
If there was ever a modern-day Thomas Edison or Ben Franklin, he was it. Thank you, Steve Jobs, for creating things that make life better, more fun, more enjoyable, more creative and more inspired.  Sent from my heart.
Sorry to hear about the lost of Steve Jobs but I know he is in a better place. I remember my first apple product I bought which was a MacIntosh man did I love that computer. But to the true innovator and the one who had a true vision for making products for everyone you will be missed Steve Jobs. RIP  Steve Jobs.
 Steve Jobs' passing unquestionably leaves a great void in the world of technological innovation; he simply transformed the way people communicate, interact, and collaborate, not to mention consume media and entertainment.  He read the pulse of the market, and balanced the push-pull dynamic between new technologies and customer needs, perfectly.  He mastered the art and science of producing novel offerings by acting as an integrator of different internal and external technologies, capabilities, and resources like very few.  I only hope that in his last days, he was able to write down or convey all the ideas he had for the future, for his vision and penchant for creating game changers and new product categories was unparalleled in recent times.  His charisma and energy as a product champion to realize the visions, will of course be sorely missed.
RIP, Steve, you will allways be my greatest idol.
May he rest in peace, He was a man I looked up too, like my hero, someone I would like to be like one day. God bless to him &amp; his family and everyone at APPLE.
Dear Apple friends: My deepest condolences to the family and close relatives of one of the  brightest minds of our time. Thanks, Steve, for having given us the oportunity to perceive and  interact with the world through ever renovated eyes, thus making it a  better place to live and enjoy for all of us.&nbsp;
We from Brazil are very sorry!!  It's a imense lost!! Must be a date: Before Jobs and After Jobs!!! He was a genius!!! God bless him!!!!!!&nbsp;
We all miss you Steve, your creativity and innovation has changed our world!! R.I.P.
Steve Jobs changed my life since the first time I had an Apple product in my hands back in 2005. A freshman just starting at the university and happy with an iPod Shuffle in my hand. Right from 2007 until 2011, my love for the iPhone increased each day.  It's not possible to describe Steve in a few words. He has meant a lot for me and the world. His soul will always live on within Apple.  We have lost a great man. Rest in peace Steve. We love you. Always.
Steve,  The intellectual property that you have been instrumental in giving to the world is something truly remarkable.  It saddens me deeply to have lost a visionary who was not bound by the same constraints of our realities.
I'll remember you...forever...
I never got to meet Steve in person (although I caught a glimpse of him on the Apple Campus during my Creative training), but he and Apple have been a major influence on my life and career. I feel so lucky to have been part of the revolution, from playing on a Mac Plus as a child; to working as a graphic designer on G3s and G4s; to working at one of the first Apple Stores for almost 6 years; to opening my own business, where I use my passion for Apple products to help people get the most out of their Mac.  Thank you, Steve Jobs, for being a positive influence and an inspiration to me, and to the entire world. Thank you for reminding us that life is short and we must follow our intuition and do what we love.   My heart goes out to the family, friends, and colleagues of Mr. Jobs. His spirit will live on within those he has touched with his wisdom and brilliance.&nbsp;
 it's sad to lose a person who has influenced todays technology in ways that  most people thought could necer be a possibility. He is the G.O.A.T... May he rest in peace.
Thank you for sharing your life and your works to the world.  May your soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
I love this man, even if I never knew him personally but I love him and I always will, he created one of the best things in my life. My iPod is marvelous work has gotten me through so much in my life. He was an amazing man. He will be one of the people that will never be forgotten, may he rest in peace!&nbsp;
 An Apple promoter and Steve Job's admirer, I will miss him deeply.  It's  true that Apple will preserve Steve's spirit.  All of us Apple  passionates will actually.  I will miss him especially every time  there is a keynote presentation as I am convinced that right there, up  the stage, there was no match for him and his magic.  Steve will be missed.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an amazing innovator and creator what an influence he  has been in all of our lives. Peace. Rest well, Steve. 
Thank you for making this world a better place.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was one of the smartest and most creative people to ever have walked this planet. He will be missed. 
To All who knew this inspiring man,   I would like to send my condolences for his loss. I believe many  were inspired by him and his amazing legacy that has forever made  imprint on this world. Rest in peace Steve, I'm sure you will finally  enjoy having a day off.&nbsp;
 Steve,            Thank you for making it possible for my son to FaceTime his grand parents. You will be missed. My thoughts are with your family.
Since I was a boy my father use mac, and I'm sending this e-mail from a mac mini... My most sincere condolences to his family.  Que descanse en paz, Steve Jobs, un hombre visionario, que cambió el mundo de las computadoras como lo conocemos.  REQUIESCAT IN PACE.&nbsp;
It must have been amazing to know that your life was so inspiring and world changing!  Truly driven
To the jobs Family. Thank you for sharing Steve with us. The world lost an innovator, many lost a friend, you lost a loved one. May his spirit live on forever. As long as Apple is alive Steve will never be just a memory.
 Most people are fortunate to have changed the world just once. Steve helped to change it several times over.    As innovators we are always told to think outside the box, Steve's outlook seemed to be that there was no box. He was THE innovator.   Apple and Steve Jobs make what I do possible every day. Even though I never personally knew him, I feel like I have.    My deepest sympathies go out to his family, friends and to all of you at Apple.    He will be dearly missed.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs touched and inspired our lives in so many ways. Dads no  longer need to talk baseball to bond with their sons, we talk about our  iPhones, iPads and Mac products. The world is a smaller place thanks to  his contributions to communications. He was a visionary, designer and  inventor all in one; the Leonard Da Vinci and Thomas Edison of our  times. He will truly be missed.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,          I’m 15 years old and Steve Jobs’ inventions have greatly impacted my life. The simple pleasures of listening to my ipod have helped me escape reality and inspire me to continue further more with my passion of writing. Just scrolling through my playlists’ brings a smile on my face and has become part of my daily routine. The Ipod touch and Ipad have helped me on success in educating myself and using it for school purposes. I’ve written over 200 poems so far on my Ipod Touch . And I hope to continue writing so, thank you so much. Steve Jobs was truly an incredible person and I’ve wished to meet him one day . My thoughts and prayers go out to his family through this tragic time, thank you for reading and thank you Apple. Long live Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
He was a wonderful man who inspired many! I am going to miss him! I   love the way he worked and I am sorry to those that were truly close! 
Dear Steve,  You have been my BIGGEST INSPIRATION EVER! I have never met you, I have never seen you in person, but somehow, your  actions, and the way you have led your life has had a more profound and  lasting effect on me than any other living individual. I am pained at heart, and this will never fully heal, but I am also  proud to have been around somewhere on the globe at the same time as  you. Oh, I have stories to tell to the next generation about you!  May you rest in peace, Steve, and remember that we always love you. &nbsp;
Steve jobs elevated technology to unparalleled standards. A visionary and a hero, so grateful that he gave nerds swagger... Will miss him dearly!
A lifetime of achievements that will inspire many new generations like my 3 year old "iPad" user....RIP Steve Jobs&nbsp;
Just, thank you.  See you later.  ;-) 
 My mom broke the news to me just now as I got home. Can't believe it.  I've never known or met the man in person, but it hurts.. it hurts to  loose such an incredible visionary and artist.  My first experience with computers was on a mac when I was in 4th grade.  God.. this guy really left a mark on me and on the world. It gives me  hope to see apple be the most valuable company on earth.. that's as it  should be..&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Steve and Apple represent the best in American and world ingenuity and this at a time when it seems America forgot how to create, and what  it means to build with passion and quality. Thank you Steve.. Thank you  for reminding us of what we we're and still can be..  We love you! </div>
WE HAVE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW  SAD  WE FEEL BUT WE JUST WANT TO SAY:  THANKS.... AND GOD BLESS YOU. YOU'RE A GENIUS AND WE'LL  ALWAYS  ADMIRE YOUR TALENT.  GOOD BYE... &nbsp;
May Steve Jobs Rest In Peace. His creative mind has touched many and  will continue to change the lives of many around the world. His story  has inspired me greatly and his products continue to be a everyday  essential. Without apple, I don't think I would function the same. My  heart goes out to his family and friends dearly.
It is a very sad day. The world has lost an extremely intelligent man, whose contributions to the world will always be remembered.&nbsp; Though he was taken too soon, his legacy is forever. My condolences go to all those who's lives he touched.
 I was slow to come onboard Apple, but I came upon the Stanford commencement that he gave and that did it for me. What a visionary! The whole world has benefited from his ideas. I am many years old but his products made me feel younger and in tune with the rest of the world. Thank You.
An amazing human that simply changed the world. Miss him already.  Condolences to the family. &nbsp;
I don't know who will read this but I just wanted to say you carry the  torch for the Moses of our industry. I don't know who will show us the  way now. Without him a computer would never had been made for a normal  person like me. The mouse, a Graphical User Interface, touch interface,  voice interface. All existed before him, but he showed the rest of us  the way. I'm so devastated. I feel lost and I don't know where to look. All my thoughts and prayers are with you.
In 1986 in High School as a Junior, I used a computer for the first time, the Apple ][e. I learned BASIC and PASCAL on it over two years. That foundatio n gave me comfort and knowledge to comfortably embrace the technology of today.  I bought my first iPhone just a few months ago and I am simply in awe (and eagerly awaiting iOS 5 next week. My life has been transformed by this little  device that Steve Job's and his extraordinary vision brought to reality. Thank you, Steve, for everything you've done for the world. Thank you, Apple, for making his dreams our reality. All of my prayers and love go out to Steve and his family at this difficult time. I know his legacy will live on with all of the innovation still yet to come from everyone at Apple.
May you RIP Steve Jobs. May your legacy continue to serve as inspiration  to us all. Praying the world will eventually be blessed with someone  even half as brilliant and extraordinary as you.
He made a difference. I touch an iPhone, iPad and MacBook everyday. Thank you is all I can say.  Godspeed Steve.
Our condolences to the Jobs family and Apple.  The world has lost a great innovator. He will be sadly missed!&nbsp;
Thank you Mr. Steve Jobs. (An Apple user Ever Since and Ever Will) 
thanks for everything.&nbsp;
Thanks for everything, and to have made our world a better  place...we'll miss you... 
I am a 15 year old girl who is on her Mac BookPro almost 24/7. With it,  I have been able to share my writing and artwork with people around the  world. I chat with my best friends, who happen to live in other states.  I do my homework, work on projects, and enjoy plethora of other  creative outlets. Without my Mac, I would not be the person I am today. Without Steve Jobs  to make this Mac, I would not be me. I had never met the man. I'd only seen his pictures, interviews, and  other types of media. But I looked up to him as an inspiration. He  reinvented the picture that appeared in my mind whenever someone said  'computer'. No longer do I picture a monitor attached to a keyboard and a big clunky  box. Now, I imagine my beloved Mac sitting at home, or the one my Dad  uses, or the one my Mom uses, or the one in our office that nobody uses. I picture sleek lines and smooth keys. Silver bodies and glowing  screens. Webpages, documents, pictures and videos appearing on the  screen in perfect harmony. I see my best friend, the one friend who will never leave me regardless  of the high school drama that I encounter everyday. To me, Steve Jobs is the Mac man. He thought up the Mac. He made it. He  sold it. In turn, he created a world wide phenomenon. Seeing his picture  as soon as I opened my Internet, along with the dates of his birth and  death, I was encountered with a slight sadness. The Mac man was gone. The person behind the curtain had disappeared. &nbsp;Apple, I hope no matter what happens, you still crank out products that  change the way we see the world. Even though the magician has lost his  magic, the show must go on.
In 2005, I was fortunate enough to sit in on a meeting with Steve, while working for AG Edwards. I walked away from that meeting with the same impression that is shared by most...what an amazing and innovative thinker. Those who have had the opportunity to work with Mr. Jobs have experienced something that words could only show a margin of appreciation to. It is through sharing what these people have learned from Mr. Jobs and applying those moments of brilliance, that appreciation can be expressed....this is what would please him the most.  When I think of great American leaders of the 20th and 21st centuries, Steve tops the list. I know that his influence will continue to move us forward for decades to come.&nbsp;
I've never written an email to a company in my 23 years of life,  however, today marks the first time. I want to sincerely thank Steve and  all of the employees at Apple for their amazing dedication, hard work,  vision and simplicity.  from my first iPod to my first Mac computer, purchased this last  April/May 2011, every time I've used an Apple product for the first  time, I've fallen in love.  I would have never imagined that I would look up to a man I never met  the way I have. I have. Thank you Steve for your wonderful work and uncanny ability to be a  leader. Thank you Apple and please continue Steve's legacy. I will continue to  support Apple in any way I can.&nbsp;
 We appreciate your Life and the contributions you made but sadly we have to say goodbye to you. Your life was short but filled with success. Every touch to our iPhones, iPads, and iPods are remembrance of you. They have your pulse and you will be missed!&nbsp;
Steve was an incredible visionary, a driven leader and a passionate individual. His push for the perfect combination of form and function in Apple's products separated him from the masses of other executives. The world is better to have had Steve, and a huge hole has been left with his passing.  May God bless Steve's family and friends as they mourn his passing.  Shalom 
Apple founder Steve Jobs. A visionary, leader and one who defined the very landscape of design as we know it. His lifelong dedication to the pursuit of perfection, the one figure who had inspired me to never look back, to never rest on ones laurels. To never settle for second best.   My current ideals and beliefs can be attributed to the prowess and determination made by Steve Jobs. It was a strange twist of fate, for that I learnt of the news as I turned the corner to purchase an iPod nano from the Sydney Apple Store. For the past few days I had the urge to get the nano today, and it just hit me like a train when I learned he had in fact passed away on the very same day.   Makes me question the fundamentals of the universe. Steve Jobs, you will be missed.  My only true inspiration. 
 Thanks to him, I also think differently .. Definitely thanks for everything Steve I will remember you with every touch on my screen, with each click of my mouse, with each call received and every music playing in my headphones. 
Thank you steve for teaching us all what it is to be a pirate. Thank you for being our hero. The day I got my first Mac was one of the beat days of my life. I felt apart of something that was special. Thanks for making me feel real ad know that dreams are possible. 
Some days the moon dress in black.... Today should be one of this.&nbsp;
For a man that I never knew, or never even met, the news of his passing has left me heartbroken, sad, stunned and speechless. His creativity and apt for innovation and ingenuity has changed how we do things on this little planet that we live on. Thank you Steve Jobs for all that you've done. Your brilliance has inspired many, and you will forever be remembered.
I am not a big computer type person. I have a iPod 5th Gen. But Mr Jobs was Apple to me. I read on a blog the other day where some where that he had retired a while back due to health reasons, so sad. May he rest peacefully, I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;know his&nbsp;religious&nbsp;beliefs but I will pray for his family in these times.&nbsp;
I grew up with the iPod, a device that's defined a generation. Remembering back to using CDs and cassette tapes as a child, I'm proud to have seen the progress the digital music industry has made under Job's leadership.  To say I was an avid, lifetime Mac user would be a lie. I've always preferred PCs, it's how I grew up and how I learned to use computers. But over the past year I've loved dual booting OSx and Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro, it's been the best technological experience of my life.  I'll always look up to Steve Jobs as an innovator and an orator. His presentations were captivating, and regardless of my OS/UI preferences in the past, and my love of dual booting now, he was always the one I'd be listening to. I'll be continuing to rewatch his keynotes for years and years to come. He's inspired me to not only pursue Accounting, but Entrepreneurship as well - so I can hope to have the privilege of working with innovators and world leaders like he was and will always be remembered.   I'm sad to see him go, and even sadder I can only offer my condolences to his family and colleagues. I know the Apple community and those on the outskirts will be mourning.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the type of person I want my children to grow up to be - think outside the box and don't be afraid to pursue your dreams - no matter what the odds are.&nbsp; By living his life like he did, he inspired the people he worked with and the people who purchased Apple products to always dream bigger.&nbsp; His philanthropy is what really inspired me - you knew it wasn't about money - it was about having a passion for something and doing your best and always reaching for the stars. Sending prayers to his family, friends and co-workers - Apple will continue on because Steve Jobs left a legacy and capable people to see that his vision continues on...even after he is no longer with us.&lt;3 
Steve Jobs will be forever remembered for the genius he was. I have owned all Apple products since the late  80's and can't imagine living without them. Words cannot adequately express my admiration and my sorrow. My deepest condolences to his family and co workers.&nbsp;
As contractors for this amazing company, we express our sincere condolences for Steve's family. His legacy will never fade.
This is a very sad day for all of us. He touched our lives in so many ways. We will all miss him. Thanks for changing our thinking and our lives.  
 Dear All, I am truly saddened by Steve's passing. I started my computer career on a Lisa (which no one even knows about now). It was the only computer at that point that made sense to me. I remember mental stimulating and such logical lights going on when I discovered my first spreadsheet as a bookkeeper (Lotus 1-2-3). A few years later I was selling computers to small businesses setting up their accounting systems. I put myself through college obtaining a BS in Finance &amp; Accounting and eventually an MBA, all the while promoting and employing Mac's as a real business tool. My entire self-employment success is a direct result of what Steve Jobs created. I give him all the credit and send heartfelt condolences to the family of the most marvelous man of our generation.&nbsp;
 We must not be sad for the death of steve jobs what we have to do is only say thanks for all your extraordinary products and for being an example for all of us and hope for his legacy remain for ever rest in peace steve jobs.
Oh my!  A true visionary and world leader.  Ideas...  making technology more than the sum of their parts.  Let's all be creative and run with our ideas.  Rest in peace.
We will miss you. You left part of you in each person in the world.  Thank you!&nbsp; 
 RiP Steve. Thanks for sharing and realizing your dreams. You changed the world. My generation will never forget you. iLove!            
Thank You!&nbsp;
I just wanted to say I'm so sorry for the loss of Mr. Jobs. While I did not personally know Steve, he seemed like such a wonderful person, and we are all truly going to miss him.  My thoughts go out to his family and friends at home and at Apple. You are all so blessed to have been around such an amazing person. Truly an inspiration to those around him and many others globally.
I just want to express my biggest gratitude to a man who dared to  change, to live, to transform the world thanks to his vision of a bigger  picture for all of us. Thank You Steve for making a such positive change in the whole industry,  for working towards the customer at all times and making our lives  better.  May God bless you and your family in these difficult times for all the  Good you have done to us.  We will miss you.
Thank you for being the visionary that has changed our world forever. Your legacy has touched and will continue to permeate all generations.  I wanted to share a photo we took of my daughter many months ago. Even at such a young age, she had discovered the genius of Steve Jobs.
Our hearts go out to Steve's family, friends and of course Apple...  The world will truly miss his gifted talent and drive for technology.   I know he will continue to watch over the world, hopefully inspiring and smiling from above.      We are deeply saddened this day, but touched by Steve forever.
Just wanted to expressed my sadness about those horrible new.  I've a vision illness (Albinizum - 7% from normal vision) and thanks to  his inventions I can work as anybody else, and even program apps.  Will you won't  know more sorrow
 Without Pixar my life wouldn't be the same, and Apple changed the world not because of its design or products, but because of it brought a new way of interacting with the arts and people. Thank you, Steve Jobs, for everything. You'll be missed. Only the good die young.            
My first computer was a Mac Centris: it had a 13" monitor, 230 MB hard disk and came with a 2200 bps modem.  There was a certain serendipity, synchronicity, "steve jobsity" about my day today. Delivered a workshop on iPad 2, showed remote control on my iPhone and brought home a Mac Book Pro.  My life has never been the same. Thank you Steve Jobs. 
I am writing this from my MacBook, a product that made lots of  illusions. Buying my first Mac was like buying my first car. It was awesome and  felt like entering to a whole new world. A world that Mr. Jobs created,  to make us feel better through high quality products or high quality  dreams. Every Apple product, improved my life in one singular occasion, that's a  legacy every man on the world would love to achieve.  Thank you Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for showing me to "Think Different."  
I send this email to commemorate the amazing person that was Steve Jobs. I've always wanted to be Steve's predecessor as Apple's CEO when I grow up. I would like to say that i am greatly sad that Steve has passed and this will be the day I will remember forever.   Thanks for the many great years Steve, and bye.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs changed the world and made magic real. Godspeed.&nbsp;
As a long time Apple customer I am deeply saddened by the death of Steve Jobs. He was a brilliant, man who changed the world with the click of a mouse in 1984, and a swipe of your finger on a screen in 2007. He will go down in history as being, not only the man who raised the bar on computing, but built the bar too. &nbsp;He turned Apple into a business institution, that thrived under his command. He will never be forgotten and will go down in history as the man who made a company into a thriving and prospering flagship business. And you stayed with Apple as long as you possibly could have, and that is the motivation behind you as it were.   Rest in peace Mr. Jobs, you will never be forgotten. And with tears welling in my eyes, I leave you with a quote;&nbsp;  Paradise - I see flowers from the cottage where I lie. ~Yaitsu's death poem, 1807
To our dearest Steve Jobs,  You are always our inspiration and motivation. You have changed our lives with your creation and you will always be in our hearts, forever.
Steve Jobs has always been an inspiration. No good to see him gone.&nbsp;
He brought us life by changing our lives, and the way we can live. Thank you Steve! R.I.P. dear friend...&nbsp;
I was saddened when he stepped down from Apple, one because such a profound visionary had left a company I have been wowed by since switching to Mac in 1998. But also, because we all knew it had to mean he was still so sick. If he had run for President, he would have had my vote. He got the job done, always exceeded expectations and was always two steps ahead of everyone else. I don't think there will ever be another visionary like him, but we can hope. He will be greatly missed. He truly was the business man we should all strive to measure up to.
Steve, you have been and forever will be an inspiration to us all. 
RIP Steve. You were a hero and will remain a great inspiration. You will always be remembered.
Steve Jobs was such an inspirational man to me and my family. He got me excited about new products and has truly touched me. I just want to say that I will truly miss his wisdom! I hope that Apple will maintain his ideas and vision towards everything that is to come from such a great company. 
“Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.” -Steve Jobs Words to live by.
Thank you for everything you have done. Wish I could have had the chance  to meet such a intelligent human being. You have evolved the methods of  business management and changed the world of technology forever.
I just want to say thank you for everything. It's because of the work you've  done that my 3 year old son will now live in a better, connected world.
I just want to say thank you. Through the Apple program in school I was able to receive my first computer. Thanks for giving an 8 year old a chance to learn, play and teach everyone in her family how to embrace technology. With that computer it inspired me to make it my career, hobby, and something I can inspire my daughter on. Thanks for giving a girl a chance. 1988 was a magical year for me. Steve you will be missed...
Steve is one of the people who has inspired me greatly in my life. One of the things he inspired me the most about was to start studying Industrial Design with an interaction design twist. I am now finishing my Bachelors Degree and heading towards a Masters degree. He inspired me to want to change the world, his ideas, his innovation, his ideals will keep inspiring em when I make my first steps in the world as an Industrial Designer He was a great innovatour and will keep inspiring me and many more industrial design and interaction design students. He and his fasinating mind will be greatly missed. I wish his family and friends my deepest condoleances and strength to pull through this. I will never forget the inspirational figure he has been in my life.
The greatest innovator of all time. Period. 
He will be missed, Apple and Job’s chanced the world and helped me to develop myself into my profession.&nbsp;
 He was an amazing man I'm actually E-mailing this on my iPad. He created such amazing devises and I'm proud to own one. R.I.P Steve Jobs a true legend
I'm a 21 year old Italian/Turkish guy from Milano with the passion of technology... Especially for Apple. You changed my life and the life of all the people in the world... I will always remember you as a genius. Thanks for all.
I was introduced to  Apple and I realized how powerful these machines really are!  Their  ease of use, intuitiveness and capabilities are 2nd to none!  Steve Jobs  was an absolute genius and has changed this world forever!  Rest in  Peace Steve and know that your legacy will live on for years to come!!&nbsp;
Ever since I was about seven years old, I loved using Apple's products. Like the Mac's that we had at my school. Ever since then Apple products have been the only things that I have saved up for. Every Apple product is a extremely well put together device, I believe that was part of Steve's visions. In his own words, "I believe Apple's brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it." We have all lost one amazing man. My condolences to his family and friends. 
We all love you, very, very much… To our generation, you have inspired us with all your contribution, and we learn big things from you. You mean a lot to all of us, like a hero to a child. Deeply in my heart, you are Apple, and Apple is you. In my heart, you live forever…&nbsp;
Thanks for creating the most amazing phones and computers known to man! Your were such an inspirational human being and I aspire to be as successful as you in life!! lots of love! and sleep well, Steve. warmest regards,
Compartimos el dolor de su perdida, la perdida de un gran visionario, pero mas aun un Gran Ser Humano.
So sorry for your loss-what an incredible man he was!
You changed the world.
As a child, my first exposure to the world of computers was on a Macintosh. It ignited a passion that turned into a hobby and then a career. As a Designer, Steve Jobs and Apple have not only influenced me through the tools they have created, but their commitment to superior design. As a Creative Director and UX professional the strength of their brand and consistency in it's presentation through the user experience is something I admire. You can't have a conversation about branding or UX without Apple being mentioned. Steve Jobs and Apple have changed the world in more ways than just creating innovative hardware they have changed our expectations on how technology can be delivered and the reaches of a brand through user experience and customer loyalty. I know of no other company where the CEO was so synonymous with the brand it is a real testament to his hard work and dedication. Without the technological innovations achieved by Apple in the past couple of decades we would be living in a different world. To say that Steve Jobs was an inspiration would be an understatement. My sincere condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. I may not have ever met him, but I am profoundly effected as is the world by this loss.
Steve Jobs  will be remembered in Cuba too.
"Steve Jobs came into my life and part of my history. Falo here a person who has earned a place in my heart. I am speaking here of feeling and energy that can be felt here on my iPhone or on my Iphone.  I always felt that all that was created by Steve Jobs was just for me.  Power, interaction, feeling ... Inrreplaceable.  A hug to all of the Apple Team.
An amazing human being has passed away.
Good evening,   My heart hurts tonight, not because I lost a boss at work, but because I have lost an inspiration. Steve Job was one of a kind in the world as we know it today. He has walked the same line as other irreplaceable visionaries such as Albert Einstein, Walt Disney and taking a way back Michelangelo.   I've been with the company for 7 and a half years. I went to Cupertino for genius training. On my first day there I saw Steve. He was walking with a couple of guys. Saying hi to people when he walked by. He got in line (He may have butted, I really didn't pay attention : ) , But there he was, Steve Jobs. A man that I had looked up to for years. He was shorter than I though, but he was HUGE. I sat down at a table, he walked by with a the same guys, then broke off across the lawn carrying his sushi. . . Smiling. I remember that smile. I saw him a couple of other times over my time for training and each time I thanked him, for being a visionary, for not stopping when people told him he couldn't, for bringing us where we were.  Tonight I think him again as he leaves us, for giving us a successful foot print and to give us the company we love and the products we love more,  Thanks Steve, You'll be missed.
Steve Jobs was more than a man of thought but a man of family too. Steve  will always be remembered as the man behind apple and the "i" series.  Every time I look at my  iPhone I will always thank him for his beloved  creation. RIP God has brought you home.
the world is shocked by the death of a giant. is difficult to think that until a few months ago resigned from the company he built with great ingenuity and effort. although many people did not have the fortune to meet this giant of the technology we are open-hearted in their sample of what is lost. is now an angel who will be contributing another way for apple. Thanks steve for teaching us that if you love what you do, you can do great things. We Just have to work whit the heart like  you did. We never forget you. you're always in our hearts&nbsp;
I didn't know Steve, but I studied him in college and read his autobiography. I really am very sorry for his friends and family. He seemed like a wonderful person. I wish them all the love and happiness. (I love my iPhone and Mac... Thanks Steve for inventing the tools that helped me graduate college!)&nbsp;
 Steve, certainly remain with us on every call, every homework, every song and your memory in our hearts, Mexico loves you!
My Deepest sympathy goes to Steve Jobs family at this dark time. He will be missed. 
  Can't imagine what the world would be today had it not been for him...too soon, too young. Thanks for everything.
Thank you for bringing the many beautiful things to life. Steve. 
 What an inspiration for all.  My live has been enriched by his creative genius.  He will be missed.  My condolences to his family.
This is a really sad situation, a goodbye for this great human being. We will always miss you!&nbsp;
 Hi Steve, rest in peace. Thank for all of things that you created, I am from Peru, and i hope to some day contribute to the world like you did. You changed my life and you are awesome!. Thanks a lot!!!&nbsp;
I never personally met Steve Jobs but I am a user of some of his products from Apple. I think he truly was a genius and the world really has lost a great visionary today. I pray that his family is comforted and may Steve rest in peace. God Bless Steve.
Thank you, Steve Jobs.Your innovative ideas and designs have been a significant part of my life. It is my livelihood, it's what I've grown into from the time of using an SE30 for my high school science project to supporting Apple computers and deployments as my career.
  Goodbye, steve jobs--the father of apple! I wish you happy in the heaven! The human being will remember you forever for your creative contributions!
In my 3rd year of college, I created a portrait of Steve out of a newspaper article written about the iPhone. I actually won a award for this poster. Steve and Apple have always been a huge inspiration to me, and after graduation created my own Graphic Design and Screen Printing company. To follow my dreams and create something from nothing, just as Steve had done. He will be greatly missed but forever appreciated for every visionary contribution he's made to our modern world!  R.I.P.  Much Love and Apple Devotion for ever!
No words in this tough  world can explain our feelings! 
 I'm very sorry to hear we've lost such an amazing and great human being. The world needs more Steve Jobs in it. I sincerely believe he will go down in history as one of the greatest of all time. I've never owned anything but Apple computers and my next great machine will be dedicated to the memory of the man who deserves so much of the credit for it's greatness. May he rest in peaceful place where there's only Apples and no oranges.  With heart felt sorrow;  One of his greatest fans.&nbsp;
  I am iphone4 user in Korea. My life became prosperous. It was a wonderful innovator. In the morning I feel sad &amp; sorrow hearing Jobs's death. I want him to live peacefully in the heaven now. I want to say to Jobs that THANK YOU, YOU WERE MY BEST, YOU ARE STILL MY BEST. 
With how he changed the world in such a short time just think what he could have done with 30 more years but only he could have knows what could have happened 
I just wanted to say that I've always loved  Steve and all his work he has done! He has inspired me a long time ago, ever since watching Steve in 2000 on all the amazing things he has done I've wanted to be a computer engineer! We will miss you Steve! And you won't be forgotten!
 Our heartfelt condolences to the family of Steve Jobs as well as the entire team of Apple. No wonder a visionary has been lost but we are sure his followers would ensure the continuation of his vision and take up the challenge of moving Apple forward in his absence, making sure that his inspiration will continue to bring in more laurels to the man and his company.
I want to express my condolences to the family and employees of Mr. Jobs. An exceptional visionary and an outstanding leader have left this Earth.  My prayers are with all of you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs gave me an incredible amount of pleasure over the years with  his wonderful products. My best to his family and friends.
 Steve jobs was a true visionary and I will miss his humor and his strength.  His strong well for fighting cancer and still creating fantastic products will always inspire me to never give up and always fight through every situation no matter what the circumstance is. I will always miss you when I use my  iPad and even though I never meet you I just want to say good bye and thank  you. 
  hopefully apple will continue his dreams so we can all be part of it               
Rest In Peace Steve! We will for ever have you in our minds and hearts...You  actually made a real difference to the world...We love you...
Dear Steve     I know now you can not hear and see how people over the world feels about you, the greatest human making human being changed, but I and everyone really sorry for the biggest lost in our life. We always remember you and love you.
Steve was a great man and will be extremely missed. He created many  great products I love to use. He was a legend.
Thank you for all you have given the world with your talent, vision and achievement.
  Steve Jobs, Gracias por ser ese Hombre Inspirador para los Jóvenes Emprendedores que luchan por alcanzar sus sueños y hacer un gran cambio en el mundo. Revolucionaste paradigmas, te arriesgaste a cambiar las reglas y creaste una nueva experiencia de Comunicación y Entretenimiento, a través de la tecnología. Gracias, por que aquí en Colombia también te recordamos. Dios Te Bendiga !!
We wish the family and friends peace and prayers through this sad time  in their loss of a wonderful man.&nbsp;
You shaped my vision of the world.&nbsp;
Our prayers are with the Jobs family, friends and the Apple corporation... 
It is really great to know of people who can dream into reality objects that carry real meaning for people.   Mr. Jobs was a true artist.  
One of the greats of all time, your vision will last an eternity. Thank you! 
This man will be missed greatly!  I feel like I knew him through watching his keynote speeches.  He seemed like such an awesome human being!  Rest In Peace Steve!&nbsp;
  Hope the family just remember that he gave everything. For us and them.&nbsp;
 I was never a user of Apple or Mac. But, since I was a kid, ALWAYS I was amazed with the special manner how Steve Jobs managed the company. I sincerely give my condolences to ALL THE TEAM of the Apple Co., also to Steve's Family.&nbsp;
Steve thank you for bringing us all closer together.  The world is at   out fingertips. &nbsp;
I just want to say thank you, Mr. Jobs. It seems pretty obvious, but these are the only words that can be said to  someone who brought unbleievable innovation in our everyday life and  changed it forever. You will always be missed, never forgotten.&nbsp;
How will we go on without him?  I am an Apple everything customer and I attribute that to Steve's vision.  I am very sad.  He will live on through the ages.  Godspeed, Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I never knew him nor anyone close to him, but I benefited from his  genius immensely. I'm only a high school sophomore and I've never known  an America without the influence of him. His perseverance and dedication  to his work and ideas was incredible. He was and still is a wonderful  role model for everyone of all ages who hope to making and kind of  change in the world. Because he really did change the world. He's like a  modern day Ben Franklin, and I know that he will be remembered in  history. But for now, we mourn and we cherish our computers, and our  iPods, and our iPhones, because we know they wouldn't be possible  without Steve Jobs.
Hi steve,        I don't know say what...god bless you!!!  --&nbsp;
WE LOVE YOU STEVE! YOU WERE A GREAT MAN AND HAVE ACHIEVED SO MUCH. YOUR SPIRIT WILL LIVE ON FOREVER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK!
So sad and sorry!  What an amazing human being Steve Jobs was, who brought us all to a world of wonderment with Apple!  I did not know Steve Jobs, but am Thankful that he was a part of my life through his genius and work! My sympathies go out to his family and friends!&nbsp;
I am sending from my iPad and I am really sad and sorry to hear this bad news, all I can say we loved Steve jobs and he is one of the people who changed  the world almost in every house around the world. RIP Steve jobs.
Thank you for changing the world, Steve. We will miss you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs put his stamp on the world in the way of Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Albert Einstein. A great leader and visionary. Here's hoping that Apple has enough of Steve in it to continue in his footsteps for a very long time.   
From the time I was about 6 years old, I have been on an Apple computer.... That was 1983.  Mr. Jobs has been a huge part of my life and he never knew it.  Without him I wouldn't have become an Apple technician.  I wouldn't have had the career in music, film and video production, my son wouldn't have learned on an Apple computer when he was 3.  My wife would not be a food critic and blogger without her Macbook Pro.  Think of all the CDs I would have to carry if I didn't have an iPod.  There are so many things I want to say yet can't come up with the right way to describe it, so I will leave you with this.  Thank you.  Thank you Steve.   
Through his creations everybody has a little of Steve genius with us, he will be greatly missed 
Finding out Steve Jobs passed feels like finding out that the "Smart Kid" in this giant high school we call the United States has died.  Some of us knew him just by name, some of us knew of his legend, some of us knew him as a good friend.  He was Our "Smart Kid" and his departure makes us  feel sadness for the void he has left in so many ways.  Like Thomas Edison and Henry Ford, his entrepreneurial spirit will forever be a thread in the fabric of our country.&nbsp;
Rest In Peace, Thanks for everything.&nbsp;
Steve,  You will always be an incredible man.  Rest In Peace&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve. For all the wonderful products that enhanced the lives of so many. That brought knowledge, entertainment, and you're own brand of wonder to anyone who experienced an Apple product. You were truly a visionary &amp; will be remembered as a legend. Apple is an iconic company that has set the standard for technology and will continue to do so in the future. May you rest in piece. You will be greatly missed. 
When I think of Steve Jobs I think of one of the few people in this industry who is never satisfied to simply accept what is out there, but instead is always striving to bring us forward.  It is a wonderful quality about Steve Jobs and is inspirational to me in all that I do.  The loss of Steve Jobs just isn't a loss of a visionary but the loss of a mentor.  I would like to send my wishes to his family and friends for their loss.  I hope that everyone remembers when a person dies you don't mourn their death, you celebrate their life.  Blessings to all.
Dear Friends,  We are deeply saddened by the loss of phenomenal human being, a person who could not and would remain satisfied with the status quo, a visionary leader who transcended technology like no other person has ever has. A fantastic  human being cherishing life and his family.  We are sure that Heaven is better place because of his presence. To all the Family, please accept our deepest condolences, we are mourning your loss and offering our prayers. For those who were fortunate to work with Steve, we sympathize and wholeheartedly grieve with you all.  God bless you all.  Thank you.  --&nbsp;
May you rest in peace Steve!  Thanks for Apple! &nbsp;
Steve Jobs. You are someone that was able to visualize the future with your  products. My first laptop was a Mac and I will never stray away. I, along with millions, will always be loyal to Apple. Your ideas revolutionized the human life . My iphone has done so much for me, from helping me finding my way around  the city when I first started driving, to paying my bills on time, to face  timing with friends and family with the push of a button. Your brilliance will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
Think different, and that is all. 
No amount words in any language is enough to convey the loss of Steve  Jobs. I feel like losing a family member. My hearty wishes to Steve's  Family and Team Apple!
To all Steve's family.  We lost a Genius today, an inspiration, he was a live legend, a century icon, we all will missed today her ideas and inovations. But we cannot forget about you, sons, wife, parents, in this terrible moment, please accept my deepest dolour.  Remember: He lives in each startup business, in each mac computer in each iPhone, in each Apple Logo!  Thanks Steve, many thanks.
I will use products you created heartily. We love you. Rest in peace.&nbsp; 
The Genius of our times - his life was a quintessence of Einstein's  saying "Imagination is everything".  Mr. Steve...... I solute you!
Thanks for making the 21st century worthwhile.&nbsp;
I'm never seen Steve, I'm leave so far but since i look for a reference in my life it was Steve. It's not only because technology, it's not about a mac or a iphone but because he was a visionary. A man that ever single person admire.  It's so strange. I'm not spiritual, but i can feel Steve right now when i look to my mac and write this mail as a message to say.  Thank's Steve. You don't know me but you're part of my life.  REST IN PEACE.
a great man, putting the world all at the hand.rest in peace.never forget you.
Strength to his family and closest loved, God bless you all. My humble feelings.
Thank you for the vision and courage.   
I just heard the sad news of Steve Jobs' death today. I'd just like to share how much I've appreciated Mr Jobs' determination to make the best computer products in the world. My family have been Mac users since the first Mac.  I would also like to pass on my condolences to Mr Jobs' family, friends and colleagues.&nbsp;
Steve was an amazing person, a master innovator, and the greatest thinker in the entire technology industry. He wanted simplicity, he made simplicity. He was focused on making sure everything Apple made was perfect. He has done so much for the world, and his legacy will live on for years to come I'm sure Steve had many more products and theories in mind. It is terribly saddening that his life ended so early. He could have done so many more things, if only given the time.  Rest In Peace, Steve. You will never be forgotten.
The world will not be same. We loved your  vision, you make us in love with Apple we will never forget you.
We will miss u dearly and you were a huge influance on the world and the people around you. We loved u and i will miss you.
Dear friends,  God provides to super geniuses for some time to revolutionize our lives and leave their legacy tools showing that dreams are possible and achievable. Rest in peace Steve.  
Not to be simplistic or repetitive, but I will say this because I feel it: Steve was obviously an incredible human being.  An individual without equal in terms of his creative genius.  Although I never met him, I will miss him knowing that he is no longer with us.  I hope his Apple family and his nuclear family will continue on.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs first helped me when I purchased my first piece of Apple Hardware  in the form of a power book G5. He helped me with my studies, my coursework  my revision and exams. He then helped me to listen to my favourite songs at the touch of a button wherever I may be and cheer me up or make me dance. He has helped to me to stay in contact with people easily, see friends and family from afar with FaceTime, and made me put the right clothes on everyday  when I check the weather on my iPhone. He has made travel so much more enjoyable as I am able to catch up on movies  I missed on my iPad. For a man I've never spoken to, or met, he has helped me through some of the  most fundamental moments in my life and his company will continue to do so.  I thank him for that. I am so sorry to hear of his passing and my thoughts are with his family and all employees at apple.You have lost a great visionary but he will never be forgotten. As I sign off on my iPhone... RIP Steve.&nbsp;
Thanks for your enthusiasm and your passion. &nbsp;&nbsp;
There are no words. 
In 1984, I purchased my first Mac: 128k, with a dot matrix roll-fed printer. It revolutionized my work as a freelance writer, permitted me to grow my business, expand into a small advertising agency, then a marketing firm, grow financially, grow my family, educate my children, look after my relatives, see the world. Technology so intuitive there was no learning curve, just instantaneous understanding; design so flawless, it made you smile. Steve Jobs imagined the world we live in; in many ways, he invented the 21st century, and we are all saddened that he was able to experience, and share with his family, so little of it.&nbsp;
The iPhone, in a small but significant way, has changed my life by adding productivity and joy.  I literally sleep with my iPhone.&nbsp;
thanks alot for inspiring and your wonderfull ideas, good bye steve 
Like the whole world I am devastated to hear that Steve Jobs has passed  away. I send my unconditional Love to his wife, his family and to all  who believed in his great qualities. Thank you Steve for being you, thank you for all the wonderful gadgets  that only you and your great team were able to provide us with and set  standards that others were only able to wonder at. You being a Buddhist have a great understanding of life and people, you  came here to achieve and you did while choosing to endure the frailties  of the human body. May the ocean of goodness from our practice return to the world to  fulfill their purpose. May the world rest in peace and the wheel of the Buddhist Law revolve. May each being that is born rest in wisdom and never fall back. May this wisdom be as fierce and courageous as a Buddha's. May we attain the fruit of great awakening.... God Bless you Steve - We will all miss you, in the knowledge that we do  not die - we just Ascend - you have left a great legacy that will live  on.
Thanks for everything you have done. May you rest in peace. 
Even if I have never met him, his innovations made me feel I lost a family  member.
Deepest Condolence to Steve Jobs ... We Still Remembering You Forever ... Bye Steve
I just want to thank you for everything you have done for the world. Working for Apple has been the biggest blessing in my life and I will continue to convey your vision of Apple to the world. Rest in peace...&nbsp;
Please accept my sympathy on the loss of Steve Jobs.
The word lost a true superhero today.  Mankind is blessed with a person of Steve’s brilliance, talent and vision all too rarely.  I never knew him but will miss him as if he had been a friend.  He will be missed by millions throughout the world.  Those of you who knew and worked with him must be truly devastated.
The best memory he could leave me without knowing me, is in my hands.&nbsp;
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs, you have made today the future. You will be early missed.
He was a visionary, a creator, a legend. a man who survived cancer, a hero in everyone's hearts. a man with great dreams. a man who will always live in our gadgets..   Rest in peace STEVE JOBS, u will always live in oue lives.
Jobs has been and always will be the best. He made the difference and the world will not be the same without him. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Finding it quite hard to believe he's passed away, he did great things for our generation, and his a huge source of inspiration to me. He originated, he innovated, he was one of the good apples. RIP Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Hi I never had a an iphone or any devices from Apple, but i dont know why i love that, I think its because him. R.I.P.
Steve IS a great man...and that's all I have to say about him. RIP 
Steve will always be with every human being and remembered as usual.  iMourn after hearing the loss, but will live with his creative  brilliance and gift he gave us. Thank you! May the Almighty bless his  soul in peace!
Steve Jobs has been called a modern-day da Vinci, and I benefited   from it just by having the good luck of being born when he was alive. Rest in infinite peace, Steve Jobs, and thank you. You are my hero.&nbsp;
dear steve jobs, thank you for changing the world thru your BRILLIANT ideas throughout the years. life has been amazing with your inventions. you are an inspiration to the young generation and we admire you greatly. may Apple continue to prosper. im a proud user of the iphone. love you steve
. . . I will miss your amazing intellect, your energy, your passion, your strength.
I can't believe Steve Jobs has passed away, he is truly a great human  being. He has inspired me on so many levels, he was an exceptional role  model. Apple has a great place in my heart as i love the products, today  i feel that i have lost a part of myself. RIP Steve Jobs. A modern  great. As i type here on my MacBook Air, i think to myself 'you will be  truly missed'. 
Dear Apple, Steve Jobs was an amazing person and changed the way we are entertained.&nbsp; My condolences are for all of Apple. Thanks Steve Jobs for giving the world years of tchnology and advancements.
When I bought my iPhone 4, and when I heard about the news for the new iPhone 4S, I didn't realize that these would be the last iPhone milestones that Steve Jobs would see. I'll treasure my iPhone. R.I.P. Steve Jobs. You'll always be our innovative hero. &nbsp;
Thank you for your imagination, innovation and sharing your dreams.  Steve you will be missed.   
Dear families,   This is Steve's admirer from China. It is hard to imagine the sorrow and loss you are suffering right now. I sincerely hope, with Steve's bless from HEAVEN, you will pain less and memorize more. Steve has made his mark on earth. He belongs to HEAVEN now. God bless you all.
It's really simple. My two and a half year old daughter Olivia can barely speak but she knows how to take my iPhone, chose the iPod app, and pick one of several episodes of her favourite cartoon which I have downloaded at the Mac Store and she can watch it again and again either in her bed, in the car or just simply on the living room couch. I wonder what she will be able to do with an Apple product when she turns 18. Thanks Steve. Say Hi to Elvis for me.&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened by the loss of Steve Jobs.  His in-person approach to computer customer service was brilliant and the computers he created have helped me improve as a leader, an artist and a writer.  I would be nothing without Apple.  It took me several years post-graduation to finally afford a Mac and when I did, I wasn't disappointed.  The computer was practically tattooed to my hip until the day it finally needed to be replaced (with another Mac).   I will be forever grateful to Mr. Jobs, for his dedication it bred mine and my creations are now top notch because of it.  The world will not be the same without him.  I offer my most sincere condolences to his family and to his colleagues.  I feel just awful for their loss.
I watched every keynote that he did just because I admired him so much.  What a captivating, interesting, and important person the world has lost.  I've never missed a person I never met this much.
My first computer was an Apple II e. I remember the floppy disks and the black screen with green font. It was revolutionary! Changed the way I interacted with and thought about computers forever. What a tremendous loss. The world will miss your vision and genius, but your legacy will live on. Rest in peace. 
Thank you very much Steve Jobs for all the amazing ideas and inventions! We'll always remember you!
Steve Jobs shouldn't not be commemorated for what he did in Apple, but  what he did as a human being. 
Steve Jobs wasn't just the Apple best CEO or just a normal creator... He was one of the greatest inventors of history... Thanks to him electronic music is possible (for exemple David Guetta with the MacBook Pro), movies at Pixar, or simply the best computers like Macs... Now, when I'm going to see a Touchscreen, I will think of Steve Jobs, when I will listen music with my iPod, it will be him the guy to who I'm going to say thank you... Ok, I'm just a teenager, but I know that he made in more that 30 years an evolution like no one has done in 100 years!!! Thank you Steve Jobs, and Rest In Peace 
i have been setting as one of my life's goals is for me to be able to shake your hand steve... perhaps, in after life? be at peace living in a 'world' much better than ours. you are surely missed. until next time...
For over 25 years now I've been a believer, a follower, a user, an  evangelist, a fan, and a creator. I owe so much to Steve's vision, dream, unwillingness to compromise and  world leadership. It's truly amazing how one man changed the world an had such an impact  on so many people, industries and lifestyles. Forever in his debt. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs you truly made our lives more better. God   bless you.
Thank you Steve - You did this for me and countless others. 
Sorry to hear about the untimely loss. To the family, my condolences. To the people at Apple, keep his memory alive by keeping his vision alive.&nbsp;
Thank you for making my life easier with your extraordinary products.  Your vision has made it so easy for me to get my creativity out and to communicate  in style.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve and Apple, Wanted to let you know, now im getting an iPhone. Haven't had an apple product since the first ipod (the black and white one). True inspiration and effort in all your products, one day I will like to have the inspiration, drive and commitment that you have.
My condolences to the Jobs family. His genius changed the world and had an enormous influence on my life. I am saddened by his death but we all should celebrate his life. God Bless you Steve!&nbsp;
just want to say thank you steven. apple never be the same but you  are apple. i will be always be a fan and customer. i know you are in  heaven looking down on us your fan customers. thank you.
Rest In Peace Steve, thank you for all that you have done for this world.
My  Big condolences for Steve Jobs, one of the most intelligent Men ever!
My wishes go out to the family and friends of this amazing man.  I never thought I'd be able to switch over to Mac, but as soon as I bought the original  iPhone in 2007 I became a fanboy immediately. I now own an iMac, MacBook Pro, Apple TV2, Airport Extreme, this iPad 2, this email address, and every iPhone since launch. That's not including my fiance's Apple products either.  Steve has made a believer out of me and millions of others.  I also wish  Apple the best of luck, as without Steve, it will be hard to maintain the c ompany that everyone has come to love.&nbsp;
Hi there, I was lucky enough to be chosen as the phone voice of Apple some years back,  and it was always an honor to be associated with Apple. It's impossible to think of Apple and not think of Steve. I sit here typing this letter on my iPad after having received the news of Steve's passing via a text to my iPhone  sitting right next to me. Steve made me a more educated person by making it  a pleasure to surf the web anywhere and read about things I would have never known about without my ever-present iPad. I think he's changing the world for the better as we speak because of that ease of access, which is nothing new for a guy who constantly re-shaped our worlds both individually and collectively.
Rest in peace MAN!!!!! God bless!!!!
 I just found out that the co founder of Apple, Steve Jobs has passed. The man was a genuis of which we will never see the likes of again. He based his work and products on the one thing that works the most and sells the best, SIMPLICITY.   He was my hero. He was my idol. I looked up to him, but like all other legends or icons, that is all we can do.   I guess he will never know how he affected us or how he helped change the world. But, i bet he must have had an idea of what he done.    Apple or the world, will never be the same again.    RIP STEVE JOBS.    THE WORLD MISSES, LOVES, AND WILL NEVER FORGET YOU            
RIP Steve Jobs..  been my idol &amp; role model for the last 15 years  and always, you'll be my role model &amp; idol forever..  We'll miss u sir,  your spirit will always be with Apple and inspire the way I live.  You are the best leader..  SALUTE sir!&nbsp;
Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.   The world   has lost an amazing human being.  God Bless! 
This goes out to the one of the greatest innovators of all time.  Steve  Jobs transformed how we communicate and has left a legacy that cannot be  replaced.  You're in a better place, Pal.  We will forever remember you. 
I've always believed that the simplest measure of a man's legacy is to answer the question, "Was the world a better place while he was in it?"  In the case of Steve Jobs, the answer is clear.  Rarely in my life have I felt the loss of a person I never actually knew so acutely, and with such a powerful sense of helplessness.  It's a dreadful feeling, but it speaks, simultaneously, to the remarkable effect that Steve had on so many of us.  To say that he will be missed is perhaps the greatest understatement of all time.  Thank you, Steve, for all that you've given to so many, and thank you for being a genuinely fine human being— &nbsp;there are so few of them in the world, that the loss of even one is tremendous.
A man who brought life to devices and whose devices brought life to us.  Thank you Steve. May you rest in peace.
As a past employee of Apple and a current member of the consultant's network, I owe a tremendous amount of what I have and have accomplished to Mr. Jobs.  I  have experienced great financial success  over the last several years due completely to Apple's rise at with Steve Jobs at the helm.  I owe the quality of life I currently enjoy solely to the strength that Apple has demonstrated in recent times and more specifically Mr. Jobs vision as he lead the company to the top of the technological world.  I started using Apple computers in 1984 and have never owned a different company's computer.  Thank you Mr. Jobs for what you have helped bring to the world.  Thank you for the opportunity you've given me personally in my life.  Thank you for changing the world.&nbsp;
The only Apple device I have ever owned is an iPod, but Steve Jobs was an inspiration for me. His personal story. The commencement address. I watched the iPad launch live on the web. His 'simple' conviction, passion, determination, style. An icon of our generation. And I already feel almost physically the void he has left.  
We all knew it was coming.  Well when they broke into regular  broadcasting....I got nervous, with everything that is going on in the  world.  We I heard that Steve Jobs passed away, I was stunned, shocked  and saddened for his family and the world.  I do not know of anyone  his  demise will not affect.  He was one of a kind.  God Speed  
So very sorry what a MAN 
Thanks to your dedication and hard work every single Apple product I have owned since 2008 has been a true delight to use. (Macbook, iMac, iPhone 4, 3GS, and iPad2). So much of a pleasure in fact, that I have decided to pursue a career in Graphic Design.  Here's to innovation. Steve, you will be missed.&nbsp;
eu  nao consigo acreditar que ele tenha morrido. Um homem de garra,  determinacao como ele, com certeza nao poderia ter acabado assim.  que a alma dele esteja entre todos nos...    Steve, you will never been forgoten 
Thank you Steve for giving the world a reason to care about Computer, Music, Phones, Tables again. Your ideas are not just some of the best in consumes computers and electronics. But have successfully brought back the one thing PCs have been missing for so long. Community.  Your Macs/OSX are truly the peoples PC. No longer are PC just a "Nerd thing". But now a part of all our lives. And it's a good thing.   Love you Steve.
I can remember being deployed to the Middle East, the heat, the tedious assignments, having tower watch through the endless night. One thing that took me away from it all was my Ipod. I escaped from it all with my 30 Gigs of music. It made me feel at home and brought joyful memories.      Thank You Mr. Jobs.
Thank you for your job. 
You have changed our world and brought us closer together. You allowed us to  dream, explore and conquer. You have touched and enriched our lives.  My deepest condolences to your family, friends and colleagues.
 Dear Steve,  Rest in peace. Your visionary genius did not go unnoticed! I am grateful to have lived to witness your visions become reality. You will be greatly missed.
It's funny how one man can have such an incredible impact on so many people. The world itself feels like an emptier place without Steve Jobs. We should all strive to be a little more like Steve to help fill that gap, together.&nbsp;
I worked at apple for 5 yrs, and i loved every minute of it; Steve made that  possible. He taught me that it's never about the institution of school, but  what you strive for when you're there. He is the definition of cool. I will  miss you Steve!!!
The man had a dream and followed it. He impacted and touched so many people.  He battled cancer bravely and with dignity. He will be missed. RIP Steve Jobs.   
Steve has been a part of our lives even if we don't own a mac, an ipod, iphone or ipad. Truly one of our most creative &amp; greatest minds of our time. We will miss you.&nbsp;
You've inspired me to create the life I have right now. 
You will be sorely missed. I'm in tears. I named my cats Mac + Tosha. I spent my working years as a Macintosh Administrator. I love Steve. Bless the family.
 Sorry to hear......My prayers go out to Steve's family. May GOD bless  and be with his family in this great time of need. Condolences&nbsp;
 You have really change our life in so many ways that I couldn't imagine life without Apple products! Thanks, and may peace of mind be with your family and friends! You will be missed.....  Lots of love.&nbsp;
I liked it when Steve Jobs announced new Apple produces. He did a really good job giving those keynotes.  Even if I didn't know Steve Jobs, he was a great mentor to me. I think the world will miss him a lot.&nbsp;
Thank you for changing the world, Steve. You did an amazing job.  I grew up watching Pixar movies, and it became the main influence in my  decision to become a 3D artist. Toy Story was so amazing and I  remembered the name Pixar  and the Luxo lamp logo when I first saw the  movie in the theater when I was six years old. After graduating from high school in 2007, I bought my first macbook  pro, which I am using right now to type this. The product itself is a  bridge between technology and design to make an amazing product.  Without Steve, Apple and Pixar would not exist, and I probably would not  be where I am right now, I would probably somewhere else trying to get a  job as a business person, or a lawyer, or a doctor, but not an artist.  For that, I thank you, Steve.  I will stay foolish and stay hungry. Thank you for making the world, a better place.
RIP for someone that gave the world music to our ears, revolutionised the way we communicate and work. RIP Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
<kaykhoosroo@gmail.com>Not all of us has everything he created, but we definitely have one, in our pockets, in our backpacks when we are outside or at home. We all have a piece of his heart with us.  May God Bless Him&nbsp;</kaykhoosroo@gmail.com>
My household consists of an iMac, 2 MacBook Pros, an iPad, an iPad 2, an iPhone 3GS, an iPhone 4, an iPod touch, an iPod shuffle &amp; an AppleTV. Many of those were to replace older Apple products also. To say my household has been affected by Steve is an understatement. All of my iDevices will be flying at half-brightness in memory of a genius. I never thought I could be this moved and inspired by a man I have never met. He has built my generation and changed the world. Steve Jobs, you were a brilliant man. Rest in peace.
It's such a shame. He was such a genius, and it probably is really hard for all those who were close to him. It'll be hard. I know I'll think of him whenever I'm using my iPhone and iPad.
The world has truly lost a visionary genius. Love you Steve.&nbsp;
 God bless! You have touched our lives in many ways. We will always remember you.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs was a rare visionary, his innovative genius has made our world a better place. May God bless and keep him, and comfort his family and friends. He was much too young, such a terrible loss.  With deepest sympathy.
I admired and respected the genius of steve.  I felt through his products that I had a connection with him.  May he rest in peace.
Dear Apple,  I don't know what to say. I am heartbroken. Steve Jobs and the company he created have been an inspiration to me since I was a young boy. I cannot find  the words to express my gratitude and utmost respect for his genius and passion.  My sincere condolences to Mr. Jobs family, friends and all employees of Appl e for your tremendous loss. &nbsp;
As an IT student and passionate lover of gadgets and technology, you will be missed.  The mark you left on my world will help guide and carry me.  The world is different with you gone but what you have left behind will last a lifetime.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
So very sorry to hear about the passing of a tech world icon Steve Jobs,  my prayers are with his family.
Steve Jobs was a a modern day genius!!!  It is very unfortunate that the world has lost such an innovator so suddenly! One can only hope that his legacy  lives on with those who were fortunate enough to have worked with him. God bless his family and those dear to him. Rest in peace Mr. Jobs.
Dear Steve,  You are no longer with us but your time here on Earth was incredibly memorable. &nbsp;I just wanted to thank you personally for not only the great products you have provided but showing the incredible spirit that you possessed. &nbsp;I would have loved to of met you but never got the opportunity. &nbsp;I am a college student and I try to model myself after that great spirit that you displayed. &nbsp;It has showed me to shoot for the stars and never settle. &nbsp;I plan to attain my Ph. D eventually and will remember your words forever. &nbsp;My condolences to your family. May God be with you.
It's not often that one person gives the world so much. Rest in peace  Steve Jobs.
Steve inspires me...teaching me to look at the same thing differently, turning the most complicated things to something that even my 2 year old child can experiment.  You free our minds, makes all of us a creative person.  That's who you are, Steve Jobs.  I won't miss you because you are all around us.
 I wish I could say "let's celebrate Steve's life" but the heart feels "let's  mourn Steve's loss". &nbsp;We will ask the heart to join the higher mind and honor the memories by carrying the torch of believing in a better tomorrow and the limitless power of the human mind and determination. &nbsp;Respect and admiration to Steve and what he was able to enspire and drive Apple and others to accomplish. &nbsp;To Apple: please please please stay on the path of no compromise and be the best leaders you can be.&nbsp;
It is sad to know that Steve Jobs has died.  He brought an exciting world of computing to those of us who were not technical yet saw the possiblities of this new technology.  Steve Jobs changed the world of computing for the better.  He has been an inspiration to all of us you love Apple and its innovations.   
My heart goes out to your Wife, family and friends. Thank you for sharing your vision with the world. You have touched and changed so many lives and will truly be missed.
I was born in 1991, and chose to buy apple products for the first time in 2005 with the iPod mini.  My entire family ran on PC's and cd players.  I converted them all to apple products, and now we all use mac's as well as iPhones and iPods (except for my dad, who is very PC, but still has an iPod).  Steve Jobs was an inspiration, and I hope that Apple will continue the incredible legacy he has left behind by making the best products money can buy.
We now live in post-Steve Jobs tech era. You made great advances that once were just possible in our dreams. We thank you. 
He not only brought the devices that change our world to life he gave them a bit of his soul...he will be remembered.. 
I'm sure I speak for many when I say that I could not have done what I happily continue to do today, if it weren't for the wonderful gifts Steve afforded us.  Rest well, dear Steve, rest well.
Our small world is saddened today with the loss of Steve. We will miss your inspirational new creations and your enthusiasm bringing them to us. You changed our world more than most of us can even know. You left us far far before we wanted. My sincere condolences to all family and friends. 
I don't work for Apple, yet I feel like I'm a part of Apple. I didn't know Steve Jobs, I've never met him, yet I feel like I could have gone up to him and just talked. Steve CAN and SHOULD be compared with other visionaries such as Walt Disney, Thomas Edison, Benjamin Franklin and much more. He was Incredible. I truly liked him. I thought of him as my friend. I'm 16 years old. I have jumped into development classes for iOS to learn, and share in the magic. I Love Apple. Love is a term that is used very loosely these days. But I mean it. To Steve's family I say this, I'm sorry, but I'm sure he is in a better place where he can truly rest in peace. May Steve look down and continue to influence the tech industry.
Today we have lost a great, smart, amazing  person. Steve thanks for these  wonderful inventions that changed our lives. Rest in peace Steve and long-life Apple.
R.I.P. Steve. 56 years of age is too young to go and leave us alone. All my condolences and my thoughts are with your family. Thank you, Mr. Jobs. 
"World is a better place because of you" Rest in Peace Steve !!  
All I can really do is express my thanks and gratitude.  His vision and ideas launched a technology platform that closed the gap between the tech-heads and the average "Joe".  His story is as inspiring as the products he has created.  Thank you Mr. Steve Jobs, for sharing your beautiful mind as we are truly better as a result of your vision.&nbsp;
Steve is now in a better place,but Steve will live with us forever! 
You have been such an inspiration, Steve Jobs.  I'm deeply sadden to hear the news of your pass.  You have made such an great impact in my life with your amazing inventions.  My condolences to your family and friends for we have loss a great man but he will never be forgotten. R.I.P. Mr. Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  I saw this heartbreaking news soon after I got up. Thanks for introducing me  the amazing world of Apple and I will cherish everything I've learned from you to make the world better. Thanks again Steve. You are really my inspiration and I will remember you forever. &nbsp;
May you rest in peace Steve.  In so many ways you helped usher into everyday use the technology that helped define the world my generation grew up in during the 1980s. You were one of those special people that helped change the very shape of the world we live in. I, like countless others, have been inspired by you, followed your career with fascination and will miss you. I know I am but one anonymous voice out of millions whom you never met in this life, but it is with deep sadness that I bid you farewell and extend my sympathies to your family, friends, and colleagues. May your "insanely great" spirit always live on.
Dear people at Apple,  I have always admired Steve's vision and passion for creating great products, they are inspirational for my company. I am deeply sorry for your loss which is ours too.&nbsp;
 Died a brilliant mind that has marked forever our lives.  RIP Steve Jobs
May God Bless him. He touched millions of people. And I could imagine him sleeping in peace and feeling proud.  Love and Respect
I am deeply saddened, knowing I will never be able to shake Steve's hand and spend even 5 minutes listening to his words of vision in person. He inspired me to think beyond what I thought I was capable of. What an amazing person. With deepest sympathy to Steve's family, friends and all those whose lives' he has touched. May his memory always bring a smile to your heart.
My thoughts and Prayers to Mr. Jobs' family and friends. The world has lost a GENIUS. And even though I'm just a loyal Apple customer  and follower, I'm sure he was a GREAT HUMAN BEING.
Steve Jobs, you were a great man who was not afraid to undertake new things and deliver them like no one before.   Keep up the good work, Apple, in the spirit of Jobs' legacy
Dear Steve, We never met, for that I am sad. You are gone, you will be in our prayers. However, I am happy and thankful for all you have done to make our world a better place.
We appreciate the spirit of Apple and all things about Apple.        We feel so so sad to hear the news that you... we will miss you forever!            
I'm not really sure what to say other than thanks. Steve was my personal hero, a man not afraid to have a vision and see it through to execution. His passion and confidence in his ability to do something meaningful was truly inspirational. He will be sorely missed. Thanks Steve. 
I'm not an Apple fan or enthusiast, but I am a believer in Steve Jobs' vision and perseverance on giving the world a status-quo-reversed innovation! Jobs will be remembered by many generations to come. We should all celebrate because we were here to witness his great works. &nbsp;
Dear Mrs. Jobs: I am a girl who is from china. I don't speak english well but I still want to tell u that he is our hero. In china, these is a saying that god wants to see the best dance, so he takes M J away, and now he wants to use the best handphone, so that Mr. Jobs was taken away. I don't think death is a kind of end, instead, it's a kind of start, a start of a new life. And this start is not only for himself, but also for u. I really don't know what to say but I hope u don't be sad too much. Just Yesterday, when I knew that iPhone5 hasn't  been launched and iPhone 4s has been launched, actually I was disappointed.  Until now, I knew that iPhone 4s stands for "iPhone for Steve". I am sorry for being disappointed. Really. I am sorry. And at last I want u to know that we love you. Take care madam. Remember, we love you.
I think many of us who have had an Apple computer in their lives since  the 1980's feel a real bond that goes beyond product.  We relate on a  personal level with the company and Steve Jobs.  When Apple  achieved...in some small way so did we.  Just like R2D2 and C3PO our  Macs and iPods are more than a sum of their parts.  We have Steve Jobs  to thank for that. So Steve, may the force be with you...&nbsp;
I'm just in shock.  Never have I discussed one man more than Steve Jobs. Thank you Steve for what you gave the world.
My thoughts go out to Steve's family. Steve revolutionized technology with his amazing talent, dedication, and devotion. He will be severely missed. R.I.P. 
He changed my life for the better and for so many others, My thoughts are for his family at this difficult time. We have lost a great man.&nbsp;
R.I.P Steve, you were one of men on earth who i really wanted to meet  and work with. God bless you.
Wish I could find better words than your tribute, but I can't.  Rest in  peace Steve. 
Dear Steve Jobs and the Apple Family, Thank you for being the constant innovator who changed our world forever.  My family and I have gotten closer and smarter due to your brilliance.  Children all around the world have benefited from the products that Apple has created.  You will be missed and may Apple computers keep thriving on the foundation you created.
 As people gather to protest the ruination of our country by bankers, Steve Jobs stands as a unique figure who personified the tremendous potential of our capitalist system. He showed how the creativity allowed in a free market lead to products that could enhance the human experience in ways most of us found surprising. I remember the day it hit me that my little iPod, with it's huge store of music packed into my palm, changed the place that music could occupy in my life by making so much of it accessible in so many different circumstances. A simple concept perhaps, but executed with an elegance that somehow made it more than a "product."   But of course, a key reason for Mr. Jobs success was: he understood that a company should always be run by designers, and not by bean counters or Wall Street bankers.&nbsp;
Thank you. To you, Mr. Jobs, for inspiring younger generations to take on the world, to address major issues, to utilize the connections you helped build around the world. Your relentless dedication has pushed me to work hard for both a better self and a better world, and that gift will stay with me forever. &nbsp;
My 85 years old grandmother that lives alone in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has an iPad and we can see and talk with her everyday  on FaceTime, thanks to Steve Jobs amazing creativity and vision. She never used a computer in her life, and never attended school. And the iPad 2 and FaceTime has changed our lives and the way we communicate. She doesn't know how to use her cellular phone, but she uses FaceTime on a daily basis! I believe that she is an example of what he dreamed of. Thank you for bringing my family closer together, for your hard work, dedication and creativity. Rest in peace, and be assured that you achieved your mission.
Before Steve Jobs computers were the size of a single family home. Before Steve Jobs we couldn't fold our computers and take them anywhere with us. Before Steve Jobs animation was drawn by hand and considered cartoons. Before Steve Jobs we'd carry a limited music library in bulky CD folders. Before Steve Jobs smart phones was something that some business man/woman used because it had a calendar. Before Steve Jobs access to the internet wherever you went was limited to the size of your phones screen. Jobs, was ahead of his time and I can only hope that he's left us with beyond comprehensive ideas for us to develop and open new doors long after October 5, 2011. Rest In Peace Steve, it is an honor for all of us to have lived in your lifetime.  My Deepest Condolences.
I am so glad Steve was here during my lifetime, we are all so fortunate  to have been witness to his vision.  He was a candle in the dark.   Thanks for everything Steve.&nbsp;
Struggling to find the right words, there are not enough to describe how Steve Jobs took part of every single day of my life since I first discovered Apple and Steve's wonderful life. I might be pathetic, naive or just a passionate fan but it hurts to know that I will never see him on a stage again, sharing such a passion for his job, the same passion someone may call magic.&nbsp;
As I write this message on my Macbook Pro, I have no words to express just how grateful I am for the innovation and inspiration Steve Jobs has given The people I've met in the Apple community, the amazing apps that people create for the platform, and memories that I've created have been through the very things that were birthed from a company that a man co-founded and would lead from the depths of doom to greatness. Thanks Steve, your company and products help shape my past, present, and future. A true genius.&nbsp;
thank you for enriching my life, may you rest in peace&nbsp;
I was just an ordinary employee of an Apple Dealer here in Kuala Lumpur,  Malaysia. Steve and Apple Inc. moulded the early years of my working  life, where thinking out of the box was certainly the culture we lived,  even till today. I don't see the iPod, iPhone and iPad as 'products', in  fact they are part of our culture and part of our life and Steve Job's  Apple Inc. was just that. The Apple Culture will live on, long after  him. RIP Steve.
...The world loses one of the brightest contemporary minds. Thanks for everything Steve. 
I can't believe this has happened... May god give the courage to  Steve's family and friends to pass this difficult time... May his soul rest in peace. This is heart breaking.
From my first 1MB Apple to today, I have always been inspired by Steve Job's mastery of interface. He has shown the world that beauty and simplicity are craved by the masses -  that given the opportunity, everyone will rise up and touch perfection. Thank you, Mr. Jobs. And thank you for for falling, only to pick yourself up and follow your bliss. You are an inspiration to us all - perhaps more so to those who express themselves in your quiet, aesthetic landscape. We who kern, skew, and sharpen the world one keystroke at a time salute you.
 I'm so sorry for your loss, it feels like I've lost a big piece of me, we are going to build a shrine in our backyard.
There are no words that can make us feel any better during this time but time will help you understand the meaning of life. Thank you Steve Jobs for giving me the opportunity &nbsp;to &nbsp;enjoy the best computers in the world. thank you.
 My heart goes out to the family and friends of The Late Great Mr. Steve Jobs.   What a great role model and visionary.   The world has lost a hero! We will miss you but will always remember you!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a remarkable human being and innovator.  When people say names like (i.e.) Edison, Newton and Einstein I guarantee that the name Steve Jobs will also be included in that company. He was that important to the world! There will never be another one like him, but I celebrate that we at least had him - even for the short time that we did. What a impact he has made on mankind! Steve may be gone, but the evidence that he was here is something I saw everywhere I was today. How many other people know how that feels? Not many.  My heart goes out to your family with well wishes. Thank you for changing my life Steve, and the way I conduct it on a daily basis with everyone I love and know.&nbsp;
I was fortunate to have been part of the amazing Apple story, having  worked at my brother's Apple store in Memphis back in the late 70's and  80's. Steve was always the inspiration to do great and different things. He will be missed and he will be remembered. Thanks for the greatness.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs was one of the greatest human beings the technology world has ever seen. Who knows where the world would be without the technological revolution that began during his amazing and yet heartbreakingly short life and career. Steve, you will be sadly missed by all. I, and world, salute you.My condolences go out to his family and friends.            
Apple If ever it has been possible I would give to him a part of my health Steve Jobs is a model for me and for everyone who has a dream. RIP in peace. May your dream stay alive. 
I wanted to first send out my deepest condolences to the Jobs family,  Tim Cook and the team at Apple for having the vision to touch everyone's  lives in a profound way. Your wisdom has allowed people to sing, learn,  and create. I owe a tremendous amount of gratitude for all that you've  done for me. I, like many, am part of the developer network, which has  opened many doors in my own life. It allowed me to take my wife to Italy  on our anniversary, visit the Amalfi Coast, and allowed me to create my  most cherished innovation while there: my dear son, Preston. Thank-you a million times over.&nbsp;
God bless your family. Very inteligent, you have changed the world, the way we communicate with people.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will be remembered forever in history for contributing greatly to humankind. Unlike so many in our society, Steve created things that enriched the lives of countless people, worldwide. &nbsp;He improved life, created jobs and inspired generations. I admire and respect him greatly and I raised a daughter who appreciates his contributions just as much.  Thank you Steve. You will be missed.
You really changed the world Mr. Jobs. Thank you very much. RIP.
Dear Apple, I've been a graphic artist since 1984, using Apple products since 1985.  While working at an agency, one of the Senior Art Directors pulled me  aside to show me an ad for the Mac Classic. Smugly, he boasted "That's  going to put you out of a job." Without hesitation, I told him "No! It  is going to make my job BETTER!" And did it ever. I started my career in graphics back when one had to build spot color  overlays by hand and printing full color brochures took 3-4 weeks. Now,  almost 30 years later, I can create in an hour what might have been a  semester project in college -- all due to the innovations brought about  by your company. In addition to operating an Apple Lisa II, and a whole host of other  Macs at my various places of employment, I personally purchased a Mac  Classic, (2) LC III's, (2) of the early Power Macs, a G3, an iMac, a  Mini, and an iPad. And it has been a fun ride from the very beginning. As soon as I opened Safari today and saw Steve's image, my heart sunk. I  feel fortunate to have had a career entirely impacted by two kids in a  garage with a grand vision. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
You did good here Steve!  Thank you for bringing magic to technology. You gave mojo to my creativity. Rest in Peace!
As your soul journeys back to the true home, may you sit in council with the enlighten ones we call Buddhas and as you reflect on your life works may you be satisfied. Steve, your vision and spirit has shaped my world since 1986. Live long and prosper my soul brother.
I will be wearing my Black tee and Blue Jeans tomorrow! 15+ years as a Graphic Designer...I used and will continue to use Apple computers as my tool.  Thanks Steve
I would like to thank Mr. Steve Jobs and all of the people at Apple for  giving me the opportunity to make a difference. While working for the  company I enriched many lives and connected people to the world outside  their homes through the amazing devices that Steve and all the  innovators at Apple presented to the world. It is because of the people  at Apple that I continue to study art and design and why I strive to be  the best person I can be. I grew up watching Apple commercials,  unknowingly watering and nurturing the seed of innovation they sowed  into my mind and my heart, until one day it bloomed and sparked my  creative ability. Apple changed the world and Steve Jobs changed its  people. The light of the world seems a little less bright, but it burns  with the intense passion for innovation fostered by Steve Jobs. Godspeed  Mr. Jobs. Mission accomplished.
Mr. Jobs was one of the greatest visionaries of our time. I am proud to say that I was an employee of Apple during its' rise to superiority. Mr. Jobs' vision for his company, his passion for perfection and his openness to think different help me with my own life. Mr. Jobs was never afraid to say "why not." he personifies the definition of  stretching boundaries. I am saddened today because the world has lost an amazing human being. If he  would had lived to be one hundred he still would have past too soon. Mr. Jobs will never be forgotten. He gave us choice when the world was being  threatened by PC dominance. His message of innovation and perfection will live on in the millions of minds and hearts who have had the courage to think  different.
steve,  the world is sure to miss your talent, your mission and your mind; but i'm sure we, who have followed your life and followed your vision, will miss your dedication and your heart.  you have touched so many lives by sharing your blessings with all of us.  from our "apple" family (my husband + me + golden retriever) to yours, our sympathies to your loved ones, friends and colleagues.  rest in peace, steve.
Rip steve, thanks for your courage to build great products!
A very sad day!  However his Spirit will will surely live on in Apple and all of his loyal patrons.  And they are many. Steve you will surely be missed. RIP  xoxo
My deepest condolences go to Steve's family, friends and co-workers.    His revolutionary thinking has marked my student life for ever.  I   still own the very first Macintosh!  I went through school and my   professional career only owning Apple computers and accessories.  His legacy will live on as we all with be using the fruits of his   extraordinary genius and innovative style.  May God bless you Steve.
The world is truly a better place with what you have achieved and we are thankful for your vision and persistence.  Some would say you lived a short life but it is fair to say that most of us will have less of an impact in a lifetime compared to the impact you made each day.  Your legacy is the inspiration you leave behind.   
Steve  I always wanted to work with a genius like you and thought that I would be lucky if I could communicate with you at least once through email, but I was not lucky enough. You are an amazing person, Different Thinker, an Icon, Inventor and Great Leader. I love all your products and think about you at least once a day while I am with them. I always admire you and wanted to be like you, but things like you only happen once in Earth's time. Your life is a good example of what a human can achieve.  Really love you for what you have given us. You will be remembered for generations and we will continue to remember you and will tell about you to the next generations.  May your soul rest in peace. Miss you forever.
You have changed the world forever.  Your genius will live on. Rest In Peace!&nbsp;
Sincere condolences!!! A big loss to Apple and this world!!
goodbye mr. jobs. you were taken too soon.  rest in peace. thank you for your dedication and for giving us some of the most wonderful electronic gizmos the world has seen. 
Steve will always be remembered as a pioneer in the development in technology!  Rest in peace!!!  You put out outstanding products to the world!
Dear Steve,  I would like to say thank you very much for your  extremely great accomplishment.  Steve, your great jobs and thoughtful words make my life so good.  Thank you very much again and may you rest in peace.
Surreal to think that Steve is gone.  No person on this planet has shaped the way people conduct their lives and communicate with one another the way Steve has.  Thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Jobs family and his friends &amp; cohorts at apple.  Amazing person. 
It is with great sadness that I've just heard of Mr. Jobs' passing.  I would like to offer my sincere&nbsp;condolences&nbsp;to his family, friends and&nbsp;colleagues.  He has overseen Apple's return to the heady heights of digital creativity, and has directly contributed to aiding the lives of millions of people worldwide.  May you rest in peace Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs leaves behind his steps an amazing, brave new world. Now he's exploring the last border, but we suffer a great loss. A genius, a man who could see the future miles away from the place mankind was sitting playing with their bones. May the Long Road opens to your new walk, Mr. Jobs! 
Steve jobs was and still is my greatest idol. I Have always thought of him every time I have bought an apple product. I haven't seen anyone so passionate about there work. I will truly miss this man and he will stay in my mind and heart as the greatest person I have ever known. Good luck to his family and everyone at apple.&nbsp;
 I am so sad to hear the news that Steve has passed on. He was a true genius , visionary and a great human being. He'll be greatly missed.  My sincere condolences to his family and loved ones.  Thanks for transforming our lives Steve!  Rest in Peace.
We will miss your charisma and genius; millions of us will remember you  every day. Thank you Steve. The world is infinitely better, thanks to you.
Our thoughts are with the family as we remember a GREAT man and will  forever live in our hearts!&nbsp;
I am speechless and heartbroken at the news of Steve Jobs' passing. I never met him, I didn't know him and only ever even saw him on news clips of Apple launches.  But in the unbelievable innovations he made, he changed my life: the way I communicate, the way I write music, the way I live and organize my work and private life. Apple is at the core of our home, in my car, my work and our family.  Steve Jobs' legacy is about all of this stuff: work, family, creativity, fun. I loved his philosophy and ethics about life that are reflected in the great company he built whose products are at the center of our home and work life.  Without knowing you, I loved you Steve and may the angels spread their wings in welcome.&nbsp;
He will always be alive in every moment I lift my macbook's screen,  every time listen to my ipod, every time I make a call in my iPhone, and  every time I use my mom's iPad to read the news... This day I read the  saddest new in a long time. He has been my inspiration since I know he  created the best software, hardware and the best ideas on earth. I just felt that I had to leave this message, hope he took his new  Iphone 4s to heaven and hopefully will be reading this...  Thank you Steve for all your brilliantness. You were, are and always be  one of my reason to be a better person and achieve my goals.
Thanks for everything you've shared.
God only knows how dull our technology would be today without the vision  of Steve Jobs.  The world has lost a visionary. 
Steve Jobs inspired me for more than 25 years, and I feel a terrible loss at his passing.  Technology will never be the same.
Steve Jobs has always been an inspiration to me. I greatly admire his genius, drive, and perfection. I am so thankful for his work. I love Steve Jobs. I  love Apple. I always will.
Dear Mr. Steve Jobs you were always been the single most important pioneer in Silicon Valley, Bay Area to me ever since my first Apple IIe computer! Rest In Peace!
I am deeply saddened by the loss of Steve Jobs. He has changed the way  many people like myself view the world. Apple has lost their true icon,  but that icon will forever be the foundation of the most creative and  innovative company in the world. My heart goes out to the family,  friends and all of Apple's employees who worked with Steve.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs, you have forever changed the course of this world you have pushed us that much further into the future RIP you will be missed.
Steve:   Thank you for the inspiration and hope.  You and Apple had an unmeasurable positive effect on my life.  I will always remember you.&nbsp;
Although I never met him in person, I feel I connected with his spirit in the products and innovations he brought to Mother Earth.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
May God bless Steve Jobs for what he did - revolutionized the future. No one will ever be able to replace Steve and may his legacy live on through Apple and his Fans. May he be remembered in the future by the next generation.
I would like to extend my sincerest, deepest sympathies to the Jobs  family!!!!  This is a very sad day, and the world has lost the modern  day Thomas Edison!!! Mr Jobs, thank you for changing the world!!!
I'm very sorry to hear that. But I still love Apple products that Steve left to us. Thank you, Steve 
My heartfelt condolence goes to the family of Steve Jobs! A great visionary of our time has left us, he will remain always in  remembrance.&nbsp;
I am a 20 year old college student and PC user, I always have been, I always will be. But its funny that I use the term PC, when I say to people I use a PC they automatically go to Microsoft. But I know that with out Mr. Jobs no one would even use the term Personal Computer, as a geek it is truly great loss, a pioneer of the silicon age, a visionary for the 21st century. I may not have always liked your products, but I have always had an immense respect for all the people that have worked for Apple, and especially Steve Jobs. As a fellow geek I stand by you in your loss.  Thank you Steve 
一个给全世界诠释人生的导师，一个富有激情的创业天才，一个朝死神微笑的大师，他的离开的确值得惋惜，可能，没有一个政界，军界，商界人士能够在这样享受着全世界的缅怀了，这种敬佩和怀念是人类对自我伟大的膜拜   他对我们的影响，不仅仅是手上的苹果手机和电脑，更是他倡导的激情人生，乐观人生和人类自我调整和平静坦然的伟大，怀念steve
    Here's to all the memories, both good and bad, that life throws our way. You will be forever missed. Your legacy will live on through the innovation, dedication, and magic that you created with Apple. Its an especially sad day when someone passes much earlier than they should have. You will go down in history as one of the greatest visionaries of the 21st century. You are so deserving of a Nobel Prize for all your hard work and innovation. Rest in eternal peace, there is no one more deserving of it.&nbsp;
R.I.P Steve Jobs your work will always be remembered 
I didn't want to believe the news!! He created so many amazing products  and inspired so many people!!!! I leave my condolences with you.. :'( 
I send my deepest condolence to his family, friends and all who knew him. I wish I could've meet him before such terrible event happened. Such a great mind and incredible person should've live for many many more years. I'm really  sad and will miss him all of future events. Rest in peace.
Changed not only technology but also made the world think of another  way.&nbsp;
From a student who come from china and study at Iowa State University  Now:  Think different. You did it
I would like to express my condolences for the loss of Mr. Steve Jobs.  He is a creative genius  and will always be remembered.  My deepest sympathies to his family and his colleagues.   Respectfully yours, share the Knowledge 
Steve, you were the inspiration of my life. Thank you for letting us be a part of your extraordinary vision. I will miss you. You will always be a part of my life. My thoughts and prayers go out to your family. Rest in peace, Steve.  
Steve and the company he assembled, as exemplifying the idea that a product can inspire and uplift the human spirit. Your life was insanely great, and we will miss you.  Thanks for a better world. 
 To the family &amp; Co-workers of Mr. Steve Jobs.  May god bless you all.  He will be miss.  Apple is #1.
Steve was an unbelievable visionary and took the world of computers and  technology to a new level. What a shame for him to leave our world so  soon, at such a young age. May the world he began continue. May his  vision continue. May he rest in peace.  He will be missed, for sure.   
 I am so incredibly saddened to hear of the passing of Steve Jobs. Mr. Jobs will be immortilized through the unmatched contributions he made to this world.  RIP and may God bless Steve and his family.&nbsp;
May your heart and soul find peace and comfort, Steve Jobs, 1955-2011.&nbsp;
Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, Love leaves a memory no one can steal.   
You will be missed!!!!&nbsp;
Dear Jobs and Apple families:  I'm sorry for you personal loss.&nbsp;  And I'm sorry for the world's loss... in a consumer sense that has made a deep personal impact. The world will never be the same... but that is Steve Jobs legacy. He kept inventing and changing, foreseeing&nbsp;opportunity and success,&nbsp;so that we could create our own opportunities and succeed in our own endeavors using his brainchildren.&nbsp;  Steve Jobs will be greatly missed. We will forever remember him. We will forever be inspired by him.&nbsp;
We were lucky to have him walk among us!  
It always looks so simple when you look back. Sure the iPod is just a  music player and the MacBook Air another laptop. But when you had the  chance like me to live and follow every step of Apple's development  under Steve Jobs and knew the world before and after, you understand the  power a visionary and one of the best entrepreneur can have on a  generation. I will live to tell his story to my kids and grand kids on how a vision  combined with a lot of work can change the world.  Thank you Steve. See you on the other side.&nbsp;
 Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. From to the Apple II, "The computer for the rest of us", to the iPhone, you have contributed not only to technology as an inventor, but a role model to many students. I was very inspired by your Commencement Speech in 2005, "Do what you love", and you will keep on inspiring people for generations with your story. Thank you for the legacy you have left to us.&nbsp;
I am so sorry that Steve Jobs has died, someone who didn't deserved it,  did so much for the world and failed to overcome this disease but was a  worthy example of struggle, perseverance and humanity. Reach these words  to his wife and children and all who were fortunate to meet and work  with it, I had no such luck. All I can say is that I am a MacAddict and  change my life. RIP&nbsp;
I was saddened to hear of the passing of Mr. Jobs. I have been an educator for 13 years and have used Apple products since I began my teaching career. Apple products have truly shaped my teaching and the way my students learn in a positive way. I have Mr. Jobs to thank for that. He will be missed. <br>
Dear Steve,  I'm just one of your fans worldwide. I follow every step that you made to change the world, with my most sincere admiration. I hope that your inspiration will flow in Apple to make more incredible changes, as you've done!   Rest in Peace!
 Thanks for the apple of the knowledge... Steve Jobs, you were who taught me to believe in another future.&nbsp;
Steve  You always amazed me and the whole world.  I was obsessed by your all creations from the age of 14 (Now i m 22!)  I miss you and your black old sweater and 993 trainers haha.   Rest in peace&nbsp;
Thank you for creating the best company and for sure we all love you company, you always surprised us with your unique designs and products we are sad that you left us at such an early age  RIP.
But I send this out to all the apple staff, from all of the apple   users of the world.  We whole heartedly embrace you all... and say goodbye, as one, to a   man that not only made a difference in the world, but did it with style.  Goodbye Steve. Some of may have never known you personally, but the   world will never forget you.&nbsp;
Steve, you  a idol to me, you were such a great person and you will  always be remembered in my mind as the person who interested me in  technology. Your ideas and creativity has made what technology is today,  and i want to thank you for what you have done for the world. You will  be missed and you will always be one of the greatest people that walked  this earth.
Steve,     Rest in peace.  Thanks for helping me feel like a kid on Christmas  Eve with every product launch!  My condolences to your friends and  family, but at least you're in a world without pain now.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will truly be missed by all of us who use and love personal computers, especially those of the Apple Variety.  His genius and creativity brought some of the most enjoyable and functional products to all of us.  I truly enjoy my iPod, iPad, and iPhone.  The quality he demanded is to be truly appreciated.  His vision of what we want and how to make it the very best possible for us will be misses.  God Bless you Mr. Jobs.  My thoughts and prayers go out to your family and all the friends at Apple.&nbsp;
R.I.P. Steve Jobs. Your visionary work has touched many             lifes, including mine. You changed how we perceived technology.             You are extraordinary and will always be remembered.&nbsp;
Prayers and hope that his last months were full of joy and peace in the presence of all he loved. I am thankful for all the ways he has contributed to my everyday life - my phone, my laptop and imac.  The beauty, and how they just do what I need are an incredible gift. May God bless and honor the imagination and creativity of Steve Jobs that will continue to inspire and be with us in the ways our lives work.  In your Mercy O Lord hear our prayers. Amen. 
Im just a Mac user, I discovered them in 1991, from that point on it  never occurred to me that there was an alternative. Everything that was  brilliant about MACs came from Steve Jobs. Having often listened to him  when he gave a presentation, the guy was pure genius and best of all he  knew how to communicate that genius to the people, to me. His legacy is  staggering. Im just so sad, I get this happens to us all and one day it will be me,  but not many will ever have made the impact that Steve Jobs did!&nbsp;
No words can describe the amazing person Mr. Jobs was... and always will be as a person and a mentor!!!! Deeply condolence to his family, friends and all who knew him...May he always rest in Peace!!!&nbsp;
I am a physics student (American) living in Jerusalem.&nbsp; We are saddened to hear about the loss of such a unique person.&nbsp; Best wishes for Apple!&nbsp;
I always looked up to steve for inspirations and watched his video clips on youtube over and over to feel the tremendous confidence and vision he shown over the years. I am very saddened today. We love you Steve from our heart. Miss you so much.
Just like to say that you so much! You literally changed the world. You will  never be forgotten.&nbsp;
Steven Jobs, I have been very thanks you for your all the works you've done for me and people in the world. I think i-phone is the best product I've ever met in my whole life because it changed many ways of my life style. I will always think and remember what you've done.   I can't hide saddness for your loss.    Be happy at the top and I hope APPLE will make more greater product for our human lives.   Thank you Jobs, and be peace.&nbsp;
Pioneer, visionary, humanitarian.  You will be missed.  Rest in Peace. 
The world lost a legend today, he will however live in spirits, via the  work, the humans and the lives he touches now and will continue to  touch. My condolences to him family.&nbsp;
We who love Apple will miss you Steve and I hope we will always keep  your vision and care you had in Apple.&nbsp;My thoughts are with your  family.....Until we all meet again
I had the privilege of having worked with Apple as a local distributor in Chile. Thus I could visit the Apple headquarters in Cupertino where I met Steve Jobs. A computer for the rest of us was his legacy to the world. With Steve Jobs an extraordinary innovator has gone. We will continue being Apple users with iMac, iPod, iPhone, iPad, iTunes. Steve is dead, long live &nbsp;Apple.&nbsp;
To Steve's family and friends, I was very sad to hear this! I will forever remember how Steve Jobs change our computing life. Let's continue to leave his dreams, his leadership by keeping the Apple Culture alive and strong! Rest in peace! Steve - We love you.&nbsp;
RIP.  We will miss you.
From my Apple IIe in high school to my iPhone 4, I am the generation of Apple. Thank you, Steve Jobs, for leaving thus world a better place.
So sad, I'm feeling empty inside.  I think it is safe to say that Steve Jobs changed the world. He was a genius and left as so early. My thoughts go to its family and friends, and employee who lost a mentor. May you rest in peace.
Mis condolencias  a la Gran familia Apple por la perdida de un Gran Creativo Hasta pronto Steve........ 
 Dear Steve, To hear that you have died on this rainy October night, I feel as though I've lost a friend. I take solace in the fact that I'm writing you this first, and final letter on one of your  beautifully constructed Macs, and I hope that you have left your company in the right hands. The future needs Apple. The shroud that currently surrounds your death will be lifted in the coming days, but I sincerely hope you died surrounded by your loved ones, in a painless way and happy with the legacy you have left behind. You were a living legend, and now your legacy will live on. Rest in peace, Steve. We are lost without you, but will look to your visions in the dark times head. Goodbye, you will be sorely missed.
There are a little group of people that really have a big influence in the world  and even though you'll never get to meet them you really think you know them  because they make our Dreams come to reality, one of those people is our dear steve. Rest in peace. I'll never thought i would buy a Mac much less an iPod but my first iPod I've had for nearly 8 years i cant get enough now i have iphones, iPod, iPod touch, iPod n ano, and iPad thank you steve for making a lot of geeks and not geeks&nbsp;happy!!!!&nbsp;
I love iphone, i love ipad, i love ipod, i love apple, i love  STEVE
Rest In Peace, Steve, from this former child who loved playing all those cool games on his big brother's Apple IIe, the college kid that wrote tons of term papers on his Mac Classic, the young professional who ALWAYS held-out and chose an Apple as his personal computer even when his company issued him a PC, and the 37 year old who now FaceTimes friends and relatives on an iPhone.&nbsp; You directly and indirectly helped shape my life and a whole generation in SO many ways. Thank you, Steve. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs and Apple changed my work life as photographer literally overnight, from darkrooms with chemicals populated with strange enlarging contraptions to a keyboard and screen. Then you added iTunes and the incredible iPhone plus the iPad and more how you plugged into and imagined what could be, then you were able to realize it. Simply amazing,  thank you for the journey so far . Blessings. 
Thanks for all you have done. I feel lucky to have been alive and part  of the amazing excitement you created with Apple and Pixar. You are already a legend... we are all going to miss you so much.&nbsp;
A terrible loss, my condolence to his friends and family. The world will miss him. Peace.
To the family and friends of Steve I am truly sorry for your loss.  I  learned some things about Steve this evening that I was not even aware  he had a anything to do with.  I have admired apple products since a  young teenager and still do. I hope that the company will continue on  doing wonderful creative and inspirational work.  I am glad to have  learned and I truly do feel that Steve was really passionate about his  work and he was happy in life as well!  I hope that he didn't suffer so  and that he truly is in an amazing place living on another dream. May peace be with you.&nbsp;
We will miss u steve ... May god bless his family and give them support in this tragical moment... You are the best ... We will miss u a lot.
I bought my first apple laptop and I am loving it. Thank you for this amazing piece of technology. You were truly inspiring!!!
I was born in Argentina. When I was a teenager, I read an article about a home computer and his creator. I was fascinated about his vision and how he believed computers will be a big part of our lives. From that moment on, I shared and believed in his vision. That creator gave me what was and still is an adventurous and challenging professional life: from being involved in amazing projects with talented teams (NASA, Homeland Security) to found my own startup in a garage in Silicon Valley. To that creator and visionary, Steve Jobs, I owe all this. Since my teenage days, I'd always thought and believed that some day I was going to meet and thank him personally, I guess I'm too late.  Coincidentally, I lost my mother 10 days ago to cancer as well ...  Rest in peace Steve, say hi to my mom and thank you for leading the way. My way at least.
Apple workers and vice president please carry out steve's amazing work and continue what steve did for us.
Thank you Steve.  You gave a generation a way to discover themselves in a computer. Being called a Mac guy or girl helps define who you are. I like to think it means: You think for yourself, exist in a world without boundaries, and love every second of life.&nbsp;
Thank You Steve,  You are a true master, Thank You for everything,  You created something amazing and you will live on through Apple. &nbsp;RIP Steve.
You will always hear people throughout life say that there will never be a Michael Jordan or president FDR. In the essence of his life I can honestly say there will never ever be another Steve Jobs. Your legacy will last forever!
Steve Jobs: You helped me with my career choice. You helped me organise my life. You helped me beat the boredom of hours on the road. You helped me access knowledge. You helped me stay connected with friends and family. You helped me share my life with those who matter.  Thank you, Steve, you are an inspiration.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I write this with a heavy heart...I was a PC girl for the LONGEST time, until my boyfriend bought me my first Apple Laptop in 2006. I was hooked. My working life and my play life became hella easier. I thank you, Steve Jobs. Then in 2009 I got my first iPhone. LOVE MY iPHONE!!!!! Thanks again for making life simpler. I feel like I've lost a good friend. You, Steve, understood us; your apples. You are our Willy Wonka. And we thank you for your amazing vision. Thank you.&nbsp;
Today I found out that Steve Jobs had passed. It seems almost unreal with the iPhone 4S being released and all talk with Apple Inc. He will definitely be remembered. On a day to day basis we see the great creative inventions that his great mind thought of, from iPods to iMacs. Without him we wouldn't be as advanced as we are today. May Steven Paul Jobs be remembered forever as a man with an incredible mind.
Dearest Steve,  Thank you for being an inspiration. You're a world changer, with a style. The quality of life for many took a beautiful transformation because of your work.  Rest in Peace Steve. Hugs for your family and friends.&nbsp;
Steve, your innovative and epic genius has changed the world for the  better for lifetimes to come.  I cherish meeting and talking with you  years ago - you have changed my life and always will be an inspiration  to me.  God bless you and your family.  I will miss you.&nbsp;
Je viens tout juste d'apprendre la nouvelle! Ce monsieur était un génie un révolutionnaire! Je ne le remercierai jamais assez pour "Apple". Il a beaucoup apporté au monde entier dans le domaine des technologies du iPod au iPad en passant par le iPhone! Dommage qu'il manque la sortie officielle du iPhone 4S et des prochains. En espèrant que vous continuerez dans cette lancée, reposez en paix M. Steve Jobs
I just bought my first Apple Computer yesterday and it's awesome. Now I  understand what everyone used to tell me about Apple computers and why  they are so special. But none of this would have happened without Steve  Jobs and his vision of how a computer should work and I will be forever  grateful. I would like to express my deepest condolescences to Mr. Jobs  and his family.
Thank you, Steve, for inspiring all of us. Best wishes to you.
We will all remember Steve as one of the people who have changed our lives and the way we do things. Without Steve I wouldn't be sending this message right now. He was a an intelligent person and has made Apple what it is today and I'm proud to have an Apple logo in my pocket where ever I am.  R.I.P Steve Jobs 1955-2011
There is no denying what Steve did for the personal computer and consumer technology as a whole.  Steve will be missed and likely never replaced.  Here is to celebrating the life of a man who never forgot about creativity and continued to push the envelope.  Thank you Steve. &nbsp;
Its like a part of me has just died. Steve contributed immensely to the world of technology and designed products which not only look attractive but are the most convenient to use.  You shall be missed by all steve jobs. May you RIP.
We all want go out and make our mark on the world, something for people to remember us by once we leave this Earth.&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;not everyone does, but Steve Jobs surely did! Everyday we see Apple products, use them, so everyday we will see his mark and never forget him. He changed this world and he will never be forgotten. &nbsp;
A huge loss to the business and technology world and life in general! RIP.  
Oh, Steve.  You were an amazing person. I'm only seventeen, but I have spent a great portion of my life watching you reform everything we know. You pushed forward the human race farther than anyone ever has before. You were a true visionary. Without you, there will be one less incredibly creative, brilliant, and inspired person in a world that is lacking in all of those things.  We'll all miss you greatly. I always loved what apple has done, and I thank you for everything you've done.  Without you, the world is now a little bit less interesting.
I read the news in the morning today and &nbsp;realized that we lost one of&nbsp;the greatest gurus in presentation. &nbsp; Rest in peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you Steve, you sure left a remarkable mark on the world. I am a computer science student and you are my inspiring hero.  I learned a lot with you.  Thank you Steve !
I am Brazilian and a guy who appreciates Apple's products, like iPods and MacBook. These are very nice and useful for our days!!     Today we lost one of the bigger leaders that we have in this time. Steve Jobs left to us a legacy, if we can create something, we must face until the end, and never give up, like Steve did very well during his life!!     R.I.P Steve!! And his determination will be the lesson he left for this world!
The world has lost a great entrepreneur  and visionary. he will be  missed.:-)&nbsp;
Thanks for changing the world&nbsp;
  Rest in Peace Steve Jobs, thanks for all the wonderful toys.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for the wonderful products you designed and for  "listening to your inner voice and instinct".     Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
There's nothing else for the world to say but thank you.   
I was very shocked and saddened to hear the news of Steve Job's passing away. He was certainly an icon figure that left his footprint within the tech, media and cultural landscapes of our modern society. Being a bit older, I remember the Apple I, II and the game changing Macintosh. Not realizing it then, "game changing" would be a constant theme for his work. His efforts revolutionized how we interact with technology, listen to music, and even live our everyday lives.  Personally, he changed the how I think about technology. More importantly, he provide me with so many happy moments of actually owning and interacting with Apple products that are too numerous and intimate for this email.  Thanks for the memories, Steve Jobs. going to miss you. 
World lost a genius! May Steve Jobs rest in peace and look for those who  remain... 
What an amazing, creative force Steve was.  We are saddened to hear of  his death. 
When I first heard the news I didn't want to believe it, assuming it was some crazy internet rumor that was being passed around through Facebook and news outlets that were a little quick to jump on such headlines. After making my way to the Apple website I find myself deeply saddened by the news. I'm nothing more than a loyal Apple user, but my thoughts go out to his friends and loved ones during this time of loss.&nbsp;
Dear Laurene and your 3 cute kids, I’m just an ordinary Apple fan from Shanghai, China. After hearing the death of Steve, I couldn’t control my sadness. I believe you must be the most miserable person in the world. I just want to send you my simple condolence, which may be no use, but I  sincerely hope you and Apple could get through the pain soon. RIP Steve Jobs. You left your mark on our desks, on our ears &amp; in our hands. You didn't impact the world of technology - you defined it. We all believe you will continue your innovation in a new born of life in another world. All my best wishes, and I’m sure to support Apple’s products forever.  Take care!&nbsp;
I would like to extend my heart-felt condolences to the family and  friends of Steve Jobs. The world mourns his passing as a brilliant  innovator who changed... everything. How we learn, work, interact and  amuse ourselves. But I am most saddened for your personal loss of a  loved one. My friends call me a Mac-face. I've always been a Mac. Since my Mom  bought my brother and I a Macintosh Plus in 1986. I remember where I was  working and living over the years based on which Apple product I owned  at the time. There is nothing in my life as consistent as the Apple  brand. It's so very strange to be writing a note of condolence to the family  and friends of a complete stranger who is one of the most well known  people in the world, but we interact with Apple products on such a  personal level that somehow it feels normal in a way. They're part of  nearly every waking minute of my day. My iPhone wakes me up every  morning, and shares the morning news with me. I spend my entire work day  in front of my MacBook Pro and iMac. And even in the evening, my laptop  is never too far from reach in case I need to reach out through the  internet tubes to look something up.  We all mourn your loss, and are thankful for all that Steve has given us  through his creative genius.&nbsp;
Steve gave to his audience, beyond the customers of his ideas.  Steve gave to the world, new vision.  new standards, new paradigms.  Joy is what Steve sought and attained for his audience.  Thank you Steve for the JOY, as i type on my MacBook pro.  Thanks for changing our life.&nbsp;
My deepest condolences to Steve's family and everyone at Apple. I met Steve in 1978, a young kid in blue jeans, a white tee-shirt, and sneakers. If anyone deserved a Nobel Prize, it was Steve. His creative spirit, uncompromising demand for quality, and his sense of aesthetics will be sorely missed.
Our condolences to the family and company for losing a husband, father and brilliant and gifted man. God has taken him to better place. We have Loved the Apple products and have used them for many, many years. &nbsp;Steve lives on thru his products now and he is admired by all.
We will miss his brilliance, his courage, his creativity and his vision.     
I was shocked to hear the news over radio this morning.  Still cannot believe it.  He's a legend and there will be no one else like him.  R.I.P dear Sir.  My deepest condolences.
Steve means "inspiration" to many entrepreneurs. He is remembered as  just not as a genius but an excellent human being. May he be blessed  with divine light and divine peace.&nbsp;
Many want to change the world, and we all do to varying extents. Some for the better, some for the worse, some significantly and dramatically, others less so.  Steve Jobs changed the world signifuicantly, dramatically and in many ways for the better.  Because of their focus on “Computers for the rest of us” he and Steve Wozniak could have called the company they built “Prometheus Computers.” The Apple II, Lisa, Mac, Newton, iPod, iTunes store, iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, are, in a sense, like the fire ‘stolen’ in the myth by Prometheus and given to man. Jobs, however, while known for being tough, was not known for being pompous.  He will be missed by his family and friends. His ideas will be missed by the rest of us.  Goodbye Steve, and thanks.
Steve's ideas and apple have changed my life. Thanks for everything  Steve.&nbsp;
A man who has gone from building microcomputers with a colleague inside a garage, to directing the largest, and most innovative company on the planet, deserves much more than recognition. He will continue to inspire, and we can only dream of having someone resembling Mr. Jobs.  Without him, we could not define most of our 21st century life.
What a devastating loss for the Jobs family, as well as the entire Apple family.....   I have sung this brilliant man's praises for years. He changed the WORLD with his innovations. He even changed our thought processes. Our minds now perceive things differently because of his products. Features that are constitutional to the infamous Apple products are becoming inherent to our senses.   Just as the wheel-the most important mechanical invention of all time-changed mankind's comprehension and spurred the creation of infinite devices-mechanical and otherwise-Steve Jobs' "i" products did the same.   He was a genius, and is rumored to be an outstanding human being, as well.&nbsp;
I hope Steve rests in peace. He has done a wonderful job and I am very  greateful to him for making the life of millions of people easier (a lot  easier!). Steve Jobs's work has really changed the way I deal with technology and  I am very sad with his death.  I wish Apple all the best. It is by far the very best company in the  world and I am proud to be an iPerson!
 Steve Jobs can be hailed for his leadership, vision and innovation that he brought to millions of people who became a part of his iCulture.  Not only did he bring vision, but he delivered on it consistently.  We can only hope that his passion lives on through future Apple Innovators; his legacy will live on forever.
Steve Jobs, You will be always remembered as the man who brought new challenges to the computing world. You made the best of the best sofware and hardware combined into perfect tools to help us be better users, programmers and so on... We are deeply sorry you left us so early and the world will miss you ever! Thank you for all your hard work!
I may never have met Steve Jobs, but I feel a profound loss at his passing. He was a true visionary and an architect of the modern world. I can very clearly remember sitting down in front of an Apple II computer and thinking it was the coolest thing ever. Steve took the computer, which was initially a simple tool for business, and made it omnipresent. Nothing we do in this age does not have Steve's fingerprint on it. Not only was he a titan of business but he lived an incredible and thoughtful life. My sincerest condolences to his family, his friends and the extended family that were his co-workers at Apple.
I am by  no means a tech geek, I can't fathom trying to imagine how big Steve Jobs' impact on the technology/communications industry actually was. But  one thing that I think I can say, is that the man loved what he did. This  was blatantly obvious to anyone that would watch a small clip of his next p roduct unveiling. This alone was enough to inspire me, and I'm sure many others, to follow our dreams. The world has lost a great human being and he will be missed. It was a short 56 years, but what better way to live it.
    Now an icon turns into a legend. We miss you, Steve. An ordinary family extraordinarily changed by Apple              
I am a proud owner of the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. These devices would not have been possible without the leadership of Steve. As an entrepreneur myself, I have to be amazed at Steve's ability to bring a company from the brink of bankruptcy to one of the largest companies in the world. Thank you Steve and all your contributions to technology. You will be greatly missed by many.&nbsp;
The only technology I could never put down came from his thoughts and perseverance. Thanks Steve Jobs, for all the imagination and wonder you put in my head and many, many others.
We will always remember you in Puerto Rico thanks for all the amazing things  you gave us! &nbsp;
Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. The amazing man who change the world. We love you. 
Hello Steve,  You and I never met but I was to say thank you for introducing Apple  computers as part of the future. Because of you, I was able to buy an  iMac this summer. This computer will be remained in your name forever,  so thank you.  Thank you.
You have given us lots of great products but more than that, you have  and will always inspire us to make our best simply by loving what we do.  Thanks for all.
The world has lost one of the brightest minds it ever seen. although I've never met Mr Jobs personally, I've followed his creations all over the years, since the very first Apple computers.  There is nothing I can say that can represent my feelings, but I know the world lost most of its creativity today.  My sincere feelings to the family and all Apple employees.
I really miss steve. ;(. He was the best founder and created the best devices. I miss you steve. R.I.P. 1955- 2011.  
I remember Steve Jobs coming into my dad's Chevron station in Cupertino. He was always so nice and took the time to talk to me. That was over 25 years ago. He will be greatly missed by so many people. I am greatly saddened by his passing.&nbsp;
  Everyone knows about Steve Jobs and what he has done for Apple, but for those in the disability community, he was a pioneer   of inclusion of people with disabilities in his company, before The Americans With Disabilites Act made it very hip to employ them.     He will also be remembered for making the Macintosh Computer Line very accessible to people with physical and intellectual disabilities,   which enabled them to become a success story in their own rights!     And were it NOT for Steve Jobs, people with disabilities would NEVER have gotten employed to work at Apple.     We would like to offer our condolences and deepest sympathies in the passing of the man who&nbsp;gave a care for people with disabilities,   Steve Jobs!     Farewell, ally of the disabled! May we meet again in the promised land of justice!     Yours In The Fight For Justice And Disability Inclusion.
Steve Jobs did more than anyone thought possible.  He changed things.   He had no respect for the status quo.  Steve Jobs created a company, a  legacy, a technological society, and for this, the world is forever in  debt to him.  Forever Live Apple,&nbsp;
Somehow the death of someone so far away made today so gloomy. Goodbye Steve Jobs. It's now time to meet your genius creator.
Steve is one of those guys who you didn't even have to meet to understand and to have an influence on you. I'm 14 and Steve Jobs has pushed me to try my hardest and to do good and succeed in what I put out to do in this world. The whole world will miss Steve and the world will never be the same without him. We will miss you forever Steve Jobs.
Dear Mr. Jobs' family: My deepest condolences for your loss. Steve was an amazing human being, that was able to change the world, using pure genius in everything he did. Simply put, amazing person. Warmest regards in this difficult time.&nbsp;
To Whom This May Concern,  My Macbook changed the way I viewed computers and operating systems.  Apple's innovation has inspired my perception of business and  development. If I can drive to change the status quo as Steve Jobs and  his company, Apple,  has then the world will be that much better of a  place. Thank you Steve for what your effort in this life and may the  next life hold more opportunity for progression than your brilliant mind  could have imagined!&nbsp; 
Dear Steve,  In 1988 I discovered my Mac Classic as a way to extend creativity among my children of grade six. In 2011, my iPad helps some of my children of grade 4 to do the same but with an approach that they can feel and see. I am a teacher  of 54 thinking that with your vision you opened the world to connect with each other.&nbsp;
I will miss you Steve. I will miss you badly. Thanks for all the inspiration. Rest in peace my friend.
I am writing this from my mac, holding my ipad and listening to my ipod.   Steve has changed so many people lives by inventing new phones, tablets and mp3 devices.  He has made an advance on the world's technology and was an extraordinary person. It is so sad to think that he was only 56 and that he was taken away from us so early in his life.   STEVE JOBS YOU WILL BE MISSED.....             RIP:  Steve Jobs 1955-2011
There are many that make their mark in this world, but not with such   grace, care, dignity and fire in their belly.  May you rest in peace and THANK YOU for your mind and heart!&nbsp;
 May you rest in peace Steve. Your legend will live on. You were a great visionary, inventor and leader. My husband introduced me to Apple products 12 years ago and I will never look back. Thank you for your great products, great  mind and branding the Apple name like no other.
Dear Apple,  I'd like to send all my condolences for you'all and just say thank you for make my life more fun, in a very special way.
I heard just recently about the loss of a truly ingenious individual.  I am sadden by his loss and my heart goes out to his family, including the apple family.&nbsp;
Six years ago I thought of the word apple and nothing came to my mind, but now  it means technology, style, life , music, information. Above all of that it means a dream. From a little picture, to create the greatest company in the world, he teach us we can make our own reality.  Rest In Peace Steve Jobs.
The death of Steve Job is a tragic loss. Such a young, vital,   brilliant man. To those who loved him, I hope comfort will come from   knowing the impact he made while on this earth.  
You have help so many people in this world. God Bless. Thank You.
 I can not express my feelings at the moment. I was in shock when i read this news. We have truly lost an amazing visionary if not one of the most influential human beings to have walked this earth. I send my prayers to the Jobs family and to the apple community. God knows what you all are feeling. to Steve Jobs, you will never be forgotten, you have created an empire and have changed the world of technology as we know it. Rest In Peace. 
Steve will be forever remembered as one of the greatest innovators of   our lifetime. He built the biggest brand in the World! For those that   knew him personally, I'm sure they are feeling a great loss. I met him   once, his vision and the products of his creation have given me a   career I truly love. Steve, you will be dearly missed. Thank you. 
The mortal life is short, but the legacy is immortal. Steve was a great inventor, and inventors will be remembered for generations. &nbsp;
Thank you Steve, for sharing the gift of your creativity, innovation,  and most all of changing our lives for the better. Your inspiration and  creativity will be passed on and appreciated by many generations to  come. Also, thank you for the life lessons you shared with us all, the  lessons of never giving up, believing in one's self and holding on to  your dreams.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a great man a visionary and a genius that lifted Apple to the sky limits. I have a great admiration for him, I am sure he was inspired by God  like all the great  man of old to help humanity toward perfection.
I just wanted to say that Steve Jobs was an insperation to me and alot of others. Because of his ideas he has changed the world in the way of communication and the way that we use devices. He will be dearly missed and may god bless his family during these hard time.
I would just like to let Steve's family know that the world saw him as a wonderful person, he created a company that makes products that are always fun but "just work".     RIP, condolences to his family.&nbsp;
Apple computers have helped me learn, work, and play since childhood.  For me, they have represented and continue to mean wider horizons, new  paths to knowledge, brave nonconformity, uncompromising standards,  dazzling innovation, beautiful form, and the joy of creativity. Thank  you, Steve.
I do not personally know Steve, but everyday I using my Mac, my iPhone,  my iPod, my iPad, I can feel the passion and the creativeness of him. He  is such a genius and he is a benchmark of our era. He made our lives  revolutionary better than ever. When I heard the news today I was so  shocked. I am not an emotional person but I am now in deep mourn of  Steve. Best wish to his family and to Apple!
Not making light of the tremendous loss to the world in Steve Jobs' death, just paying a tribute to his life's impact in the language he gave to the world.
I have had the pleasure to work at Apple for 2 years now. I have taken so much pride in being a specialist and will continue my time for as long as I can.  The things I remember most about Steve would be the videos at every meeting.  Whenever my love for the Apple Store would begin to fade, either from tough customers or long days, we would have the scheduled store meetings in which Steve would always come on.  Between him and the others my pride and love for the Apple Store would be rekindled. Steve's words were always inspiring and showed each and everyone of us that we shared the same passion.   As it has been said many times Steve will be missed, but his ideals will live on as the foundation of this great company.  I just thought I would share this personal memory of him from the perspective of those who worked for him.&nbsp;
A family member is dead.  :( 
Dear Steve,  Thank you for inventing IPOD. Listening to Music has never been so much fun without your IPOD. Rest in peace Boss. Enjoy your journey in heaven.&nbsp;
Dear Everyone.  I send this email to show my gratitude and mourning. As CEO and co-founder of Apple, he gave the world so much vision and revolutionary things. As a person, he is a kind of idol and goal of my life. 56 is too young to leave.  Always in our heart.&nbsp;
You were a visionary. I have but one thing to say. Thank you, thank you, and thank you. You will live on in our hearts. You will never be forgotten. Thank you.&nbsp;
the world would be a far less interesting place without Steve Jobs. people like him are what make our lives interesting, what make our eyes boggle, and people like him made the world a better place and continue to inspire us to do the same. the world needs more people like Steven Paul Jobs. 
 The world lost a person who has impacted our lives in everything we do today.  My heart and prayers go out to his family and may he rest in peace.&nbsp;
This is a very sad day. I would like to convey my condolences to everybody at Apple and to Steve's family.  He will always live in the minds of millions of fans and admirers.
I was fortunate to have met Steve. He was an amazing man who's brilliance has forever changed our lives. I send my condolences to all of you that knew him well and have lost a friend but especially to his wife and children. He will be missed by the entire world but heaven has a very special angel. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
  My sincere condolences to the Jobs family and to his extented Apple family, we all lost a great human being.
I am just one of Apple's many customers but am surprised by how affected I am by Steve's passing, as I never knew the man personally. And yet, in a way,  I did. He gave himself so selflessly to every aspect of Apple and its products that to own a piece of Apple is to know Steve Jobs. Indeed, his spirit lives on with each and every one of us through the very products he  so lovingly created. To own Apple technology is to know Steve Jobs, and I am deeply saddened by his passing. May he rest in peace.
I have never met Steve Jobs, but his ideas and visions influenced my life. We are all connected and we exist only for a short time. I am always amazed by those special few that see what will come with such clarity. Steve Jobs is  special and I will miss him even though we have never met.
Thank for everything thing Steve, your products helped shape my  life! You will surely be missed. RIP 
 Steve will always be my reference for my projects. Since the initial  idea to the finished product. He taught me, through his company, his  ideas and his way of seeing the world, how we can be truly effective.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve for all you have given me.  Thank you for the Apple II.  As a teenager, it let me push the boundaries of  what I could do with a computer. &nbsp;Thank you for supporting me to create one of the first desktop publishing companies in 1985.  It doesn't exist anymore, but that's not the point.  The experience of pushing the envelope with those early Macs, and the experience of Apple supporting me helping make one of the world's first natively compiled object oriented COTS products has forever changed how I view and deal with  technology.  Thank you for letting us live the fantasies.  Pixar brought legendary stories and images into our houses.  Thank you for giving us style.  The iMac not only gave us superior technology, it gave us superior design.  Who knew a computer could be a fashion statement?  Thank you for entertaining us and changing the way we entertain ourselves.  The iPod and iTunes altered the way we think of media.  Apple TV has altered the way it's delivered.  Thank you for showing us what a phone should really be like.  Thank you for changing the paradigm.  We never knew we needed the iPad, and now the word "tablet" is no longer associated with something we swallow.  But most of all, thank you for bucking the trend and following your heart.  Today the world is just a little bit darker.&nbsp;
Thanks for the memories and for the best products out in the market.
I look around and see all the amazing things that I use in my daily life, thanks to Steve. A truly special person. The world is a sadder place without him.&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened by the loss of a true genius, a humanitarian, a guy I could look up to.  Rest in Peace Steve.  We will always love you! 
My condolences, he was an amazing human being, we love you forever Steve.&nbsp;
Our heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Jobs, one of  the great visionary and leader of our times...&nbsp;
Two quotes I believe appropriate I would like to put forward from George Bernard Shaw, "You see things; and you say, 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say, 'Why not?'"...."If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas."... Mr. Jobs not only traded technological comodities; but more importantly ideas and concepts that has allowed enabled and empowered so many people to communicate ideas and thoughts with each other as never possible before.  A driven and passionate unique individual whose altruistic sincerity and dedication towards his life and work touched so many both personally and by way of his vision for technology as an art... the arts of industry as applied to peace.&nbsp;
We have lost a true innovator and an individual who cared so much about his customers and technology. My thoughts go out to Jobs' family and friends. You will be missed, but never forgotten. 
 May you rest in peace, Mr. Jobs. Your were a visionary and a gift to mankind. You have helped us move into the 21st century and beyond. I always had/still have this crazy Star Trek scenario that you came from the future and reversed engineered some of the amazing things that you saw there. But the best part is that you did it for us and humankind, not just for yourself. That's why every Apple product was perfect for ordinary, creative people.  My condolences to your family.
My deepest sympathies for a man who has left an indelible mark on the   lives of many with his genius. He will be remembered in history of   mankind as the mastermind of not just functional but beautiful   products. It is a pity that the "emperor of all maladies" has claimed   his life, but his spirit will last forever. Long live the APPLE! 
I will never forget the best getting better every time I saw Steve at work.
Remembering a soul who was inspirational, intellectual, and an ever  reminder of what can be! 
You left Oregon around the time I moved here. I live near Reed College and drive by frequently, and often reflect on  how Apple and The Mac have affected and effected my life. History will show the magnitude of your contribution to the people of  the world. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I'm in disbelief, witness the end of a life dedicated to create and pursue perfection. With much sorrow I'm sending this simple message to family and friends of this bright and talented person.  God bless and comfort to all.
My thoughts are with Steve's family, and the people at Apple.  I celebrate Steve's contributions to the world every time I boot up my macs or use my iPhone/iPad/iPods etc. These are all inventions that combine high technology with simplicity and user experience focused design.  For a man and a company to be responsible for just ONE of these paradigm shifting devices is amazing. For a man and a company to be behind ALL of these is nothing short of legendary.  Steve understood what the world needed, and sold it to the world in an attractive shell at a reasonable price, better than the rest, with a visceral aggressiveness and honest bluntness.  The man didn't compromise and didn't rest until he'd put the best experience  possible into the hands of the user.  I will miss him and his charismatic leadership of my favourite company.  Farewell Steve Jobs, The world's greatest salesman.
Thank you so much Steve for connecting us all and creating some of the best products ever made.  Prayers go out to the Jobs family.&nbsp;
Condolences to Steve's family. You're an inspiration to the world we  live in today, a humble genius and a great inventor! Rest in Peace Mr.  Jobs! <br>
The technology created by Him and Apple is miraculous and his devotion  with his company to the community is all that we could ever ask for and  more. The man was a miracle worker. He won't be forgotten and I hope  that Apple continues as he would have it, that the world pay him the  tribute he deserves for all that he has done for us. May he rest in  peace for we know he is in a better place. 
The world as we know it will never be the same... the Michelangelo of the digital era...   Thank You Steve, for sharing your amazing gifts.
It's been a Trip dude... Steve Jobs RIP I write this on my iMac whilst syncing my iPhone with an iPod blaring on the stereo in the background. My first real experiences on computers where at school on LEIIs, my first time on the net was on a 4500 beige box Macintosh, my first personal system was a 5200/128 A beast Macintosh with 128mhz processor and 64mb of RAM Photoshop 3 and Avid WooHoo, since then I've had about 5 different machines up to my current iMac i5 quad core 27 inch beastie. So yeah I guess he influenced my life in a major way. Deeply saddened by this loss to mankind, innovation and invention.
Steve Jobs was an amazing human being.He was a world leader. He is the leader of creators. His electronic devices are so amazing that almost every single  human being on earth had one of his amazing devices. He is beyond the stars. I wish Apple the leaders of the world good luck.You can do it!
please accept my condolences. it has been a wonderful journey. It all began with your iBook G4 whom helped me with my Law degree, your G5 still give me a pleasant experience on all my works, your Macbook Pro have helped my girlfriend with her Economic degree, your iPad have give me the whole new internet and digital experience, your iPhone had give me the space to remember all your love for us. Thank you for bringing the joy to this world. Thank you for everything.&nbsp;
Thank you Mr. Jobs for forever changing our lives and our relationships with technology, and most important of all, our generation.
Dear Steve Jobs,&nbsp;<div>Thank you for providing the best products for more than 20+ years. My first computer from 1994 was a Macintosh, and my last computer will be too. You are the Thomas Edison of our time. Thank you for founding Pixar, and Apple giving us technology and memories that changed our world forever. &nbsp;</div>
Steve was a guy I never met, from a country I've never been to, who  built a company I've never worked for, but I 'knew' Steve. I knew him  through the products which I see, hear and touch every day, I knew him  from the keynotes and interviews which have captivated and inspired me,  and I knew him because I understand what he wanted to achieve - and what  he has achieved.  I am lost for words, and my sincerest thoughts go out to his family,  friends and colleagues, as well as the computer industry as a whole.  There will never, ever be another Steve...  You will continue to inspire me.&nbsp;
Thank you for all the iToys and the iDreams you gave me. You have a left  an iMark in my iHeart.  Rest in peace Mr. Jobs. You have done a lot for this world.
You made some gadgets, You defied the greatest of competition, You built  your own company, then Rebuilt it. As I sit here and type on my Mac I  can only imagine how each thing I do, is the brainchild of you. YOU have inspired millions, me included. I have began learning Computer  Programming in a hope that one day, ONE day I might have HALF the  success you had. whoever is reading this probably thinks I am crazy for writing to a dead guy; but Steve, if you are up there in  CPU heaven, Smiling at the jaw dropping awe your products have and will  unleash, Thank You. 
Thank you Steve, for making this world a more pleasant place in which to live. For making our daily lives easier to cope with. For always giving us some thing to look forward to. Thank you for sharing your gift with us. Your extraordinary passion, dedication and your vision are truly an inspiration to us all.  May your legacy forever live on in the Magical and Revolutionary products you gave us.&nbsp;
My sincerest sympathies to Steve's family. He fought a courageous   battle-yet lived life with passion even until the end of his life   here. Heaven is gaining a visionary. 
May your family have the strength to carry on, you touched  many lives and your "Apple" legacy will live on.
My thoughts and prayers are with Laurene and the children.&nbsp;
It's strange how something as simple as a computer can profoundly affect you. One of my fondest memories from my childhood involve my Dad bringing home a Mac II. Throughout the years he taught me about computers through numerous Mac's. Those experiences set me on the course my life has taken today. I do what I love because of those experiences.  Thank you Steve Jobs, your vision has enabled me to do what I love. It will live on forever.
A great innovator. A great achiever. A great contributor. One of my mentors. May God's love be with his wife and kids.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,  It is coming up to 3 in the morning in France and I have just heard the  sad news about Mr Steve Job's passing.  It is of course with deep  sadness that I am writing this email.  I would like to send my  heart-felt condolences to Steve Jobs' family, friends and to everyone at  Apple.  Steve will be sorely missed, may he rest in peace.  I have been a mac user for almost 2 years now.  I am a totally blind  person and, thanks to Steve Jobs and Apple, a visually challenged person  is able to use a computer right out of the box without having to install  third-party software which costs more than the computer itself.  I also  have an Iphone and Ipod touch.  Of course I would like to thank Mr Steve  Jobs for enabling  disabled people to use an Apple devise and making the  most out of it, I will never thank him enough for including us in the  Apple experience.  May you rest in Peace Mr Steve Jobs and, thank you  for the wonderful work you've done.  You will be sorely missed and  forever remembered.  Heart felt condolences to his family, friends and everyone at Apple,  thank you again so much!&nbsp;
Thanks for the life you lived and the innovation you left. You will be  missed... 
The world has lost its visionary genius.  He was todays Thomas Edison and Walt Disney rolled into one. My heart goes out to his family and his extended family at Apple. As an executive fortunate enough to work in the television news business for over 42 years, my home and business are filled with Apple products. I will not be able to pick up my iPad, iPhone or use my iMac computers without remembering Steve.
A very sad day for all human kind,  He will remain among us,   His dream changed the world. 
I had no idea what I would use a computer for. When I saw the first Mac in 1984, I knew I had to have it. The look of it without even turning it on enticed me to do more. I looked at the mouse, and thought it was some sort of foot pedal. The sales guy from Schaak Electronics had to gently explain what it was used for. I had no money at the time, so my brother co-signed a loan to get the 128k Mac, external drive and an ImageWriter I printer. Thus started my career in IT, and my understanding of what was needed to "put a dent in the universe." I'm now 48 years old, and still have that Mac in the attic. I'll never part with it. It was the beginning for me.  Thanks to Steve and Apple.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  You inspired me as a leader and human being. I will miss you.&nbsp;
I remember when I was little, hearing about the great Steve Jobs. Now, I  am still young at 14 years old, I hear about his passing. I am a large  buyer of Apple products, each one of them amazing me. Steve will go down  in history as a great innovator, one of the most advanced inventors, and  the man that created modern technology. Although it may sound stupid, I  am going to buy the iPhone 4s in respect of Steve Jobs. I pray for you  Steve, and those who are hurt from your death. You were creative.  Original. Inspiring. You are legendary. 
Thanks for changing the world, for thinking different, for not only creating the technology, but for giving it a heart and soul. For making it just work.   Thanks for inspiring me with your creations and visions...  My condoleances to your family and loved ones.
<div>I'm sure the legacy Steve Jobs created will continue.... it is and always will be a  pleasure using Apple products because unlike most, they just work!  Keep the dream alive people!&nbsp;</div>
 He will be forever in our memories! Hope his spirit stay with all of you and give you power to keep on way! I just can say thanks to Steve and to you to give us the opportunity for the future!&nbsp;
Steve --  You didn't make a dent in the universe. You made a giant hole and filled it with beauty and technical wizardry that has touched billions of people's lives and billions more to come.&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened. My heart goes our to the family and the world. What Steve gave to us all is beyond words. An incredible loss to mankind.  I am honored to have lived in Silicon Valley and to have been a part of its greatness. The world will never be the same. My deepest condolences to the family.
Just heard that Steve Jobs has died,        The world has lost a great visionary.  I've always respected Steve Jobs because he didn't settle for "good enough" in the design of his products.  He had a natural talent for designing products that people wanted, before they knew they wanted them.  He was a natural leader who inspired a passion and loyalty in his employees and customers that few other companies can claim. I just hope he was as good at training his successors as he was at designing fantastic products.  May he rest in peace.
i will be in awe of steve jobs and what he accomplished for the rest of my life. i'm one of the millions of people who loves apple because of its design, its ingenuity, and its thoughtfulness. i credit apple with making me a tech-nerd and lover of things electronic.  as a person, it seems that mr. jobs lived his life with spontaneity and adventure, and for him, that meant realized brilliance.  i will always be inspired by his example.  -
Thank you Steve for the innovative products you made available for a   non-geek person like me; who has enjoyed using an Apple product since   I was introduced to computers. From the Mac Classic to an IMac and   laptop, I use them daily for business, education, and pleasure. There   is always a truth I can believe in when I need the reliability; and   the knowledge and help with a computer issue in time of need. Great   staff, great products, and a great leader. Impressive beyond words.   You will be remembered.     -
Dear Steve   Thank you very much for changing my world, our world.  You will be missed.   May your soul reincarnate in another beautiful human being that also improves so greatly our world.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs, your products and ideas shape the world.  As a 14 year old, I was incredibly awed and excited at having my first Apple product. The sleekness of the design and functionality of my iPod filled me with joy, and I would have no qualms against boasting it to my friends.  My childhood was defined by technology, and by Apple. You have played a major role in my life; directly or indirectly is irrelevant. For that, I thank you.  May the Apple, a product of your genius, shine forever.&nbsp;
Steve how you have changed our vision and reality of possibilities. To You, to Apple I commit to never activating any other type of phone that is not part of the Apple family. &nbsp;Your vision will continue to change and mold our future. &nbsp;A commitment to you our Apple Family to keep faithful to your vision!
He will be deeply missed!!!!!!&nbsp;
I watched his speech to the Stanford Graduates the year he was given an honorary degree and I have to say, hand on my heart, it was the most inspirational talk I have ever heard. It changed my attitude and way of dealing with my eldest daughters applications for College. We have lost such a unique individual.  Thank you Steve Jobs - you truly inspired me. 
America needs more jobs - Steve Jobs that is.  RIP      Master of Inspiration 
I grew up with apple and never knew windows or a pc.&nbsp;You changed my life and you changed the world.You are an inspiration.Thank you for what you did with your life.
Thank you Steve for the iMac, Macbook Air and iPad, which changed my life. Apple teaches me to become a better man, through it's design, motto and way of doing business.  I'm so sad the iPhone 4S is the last creation of Jobs and will be my first iPhone. We love you Steve, and Apple. You are with us forever.&nbsp;
I just want to express my deepest condolences to his family friends and the people of Apple, without doubt, Steve was one the most important figure of the centuries (XX &amp; XXI), the world has lost a brilliant human being. Rest in peace.
Thanks for share your ideas with us!&nbsp;
 When some friends of mine call me at the middle of the night (in France) to tell me the death of Steve Jobs, i don't believe it! i'm a mac user, a pro Apple, a Apple's fan for many years, and i feel devastated  Thank you Steve Jobs! you made the world better!! you made my life better! .. a greatest visionary, a genius is dead! You will be missed....Rest in Peace "my friend".... it's a very very sad day! ;( &nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your wonderful products.  You are a true visionary and your imprint on all of our lives will remain.  God bless you and your family.&nbsp;
The man changed my life. God bless.&nbsp;
One thing is certain. He changed the way we see and perceive technology. A remarkable man.  Godspeed Steve... Godspeed.&nbsp;
Hello I am a 15 year old who is obsessed with Apple Inc., 20  I am EXTREMELY saddened by this event. It makes me think about  how he was just so amazing with his innovations. I am just heartbroken  that this happened and it makes me look at my iMac and say, that man has  changed my life with all of his wonderful ideas. He will forever be my  inspiration for everything that I do. He is the reason I am so  interested in electronics. 09      With LOVE,&nbsp;
Thank you for everything! 
It's really sad that Steve is not in this world anymore. But his work and ideas will live forever. I wish i could had had a chance to shake his hand and said thank you.  As a designer and a technology professional, it's really nice to know that I was here when Steve was changing the world of technology, design and communication between humans.  I lost my father for the cancer too. I know how hard it is, and it's good for him that there is no pain anymore. Just peace for him and his family.  I will always be a huge fan.
My daughters and I just got a first Apple product (iPod touch)  this summer.   We really love it and want to thank Apple for  creating those products.   We became  BIG Apple Fan.       Apple came to this world by Steve Jobs.   He gave us great fortune.       He was too young to die.   It's great loss to us, to this world.   I will, we will, this world will miss him.   Thank you for sharing your passion with us.       Please follow the way Steve Jobs creates   And keep running Apple as a top of the world company.&nbsp;
This is a phrase from the movie Serendipity:  "Greeks didn't write obituaries. They only asked one question after a man died: Did he have passion?" Steve Jobs definitely had it. RIP.
My deepest heartfelt condolences go out to Steve's family. We have lost a visionary who changed the way people interact with technology on a daily basis.  You will be missed.
Just wanted to express my sorrow over the loss of this great man and   visionary...truly a sad day. God bless you, Steve and rest in peace. 
Although i have never met Steve Jobs the news of his passing greatly saddened me. The world will be different without him. He was an inspiration to all business people and entrepreneurs. I am reminded of the lyrics of the song 'Bye bye Miss American Pie'. Today is the day the music died. God Speed Steve, &nbsp;
It is a pleasure working for the company that Steve built.  He brought the world to their knees in awe and back to their feet with a standing ovation with the products he shared with them.  He will be sorely missed. Goodbye Mr Jobs&nbsp;
 "changing the NeXT world by being different!" thank you, Steve...for help making my life interesting and useful.
Steve, just thank you for your legacy. You were brilliant and achieve what few people succeed in life ... admiration, respect, trust. You were a really big man, to transform an apple into an empire and never settle for being the best, simply because you were better than the best. Wherever you are, just thanks from Argentina.&nbsp;
 Thank you very much for your contribution of our world !             
Thank you for the impact you made on our world. My thoughts and prayers are with the Jobs family.&nbsp;
I am grateful that Steve Jobs had the impact on the globe that he did. He is  a hero of mine not because of his success in life but because he was a decent human being. 
You will never be fogotten from all of us in the world.
Rest in peace. I thank you for sharing your brilliance with the world   and giving us so very much.
You let me know what my life should be. Thank you. 
My first memories of Apple go back to my old Lisa and Mac+ computers. I've been an Apple junkie ever since. Apple has lost his daily presence, but his spirit runs through the entire tech community.   Raising a Guinness in his honor.
It is with great sadness, that I learnt today of the death of Steve Jobs.  We will never forget you, Steve. Our thoughts are with you always as well as those you leave behind.  May you find peace on the other side.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs completely changed and revolutionised the modern day computing experience. A giant gap is left with his passing, but his vision and direction lives on through his beautiful products and ideas. RIP Steve, You changed the computing world. 
I am just a know body, but because of the technologies you have brought to "we the people", my life has been blessed. I have enjoyed numerous products ever sense the early 80's and have never regretted my allegiance to this great life changing establishment. I am sure Steve whom we all reverence, has left this great phenomenon, in great hands. My prayers are with the family and you all. My Daughter was a recipient of a Liver Transplant and we have always had Steve in our prayers for the blessing of better health. He is deeply missed.
I am proud that I lived at same time with Steve. Thank you so much for provide greatest thing ever for long time. You are the proud of American, and I thank you so much Steve. Your product gave a so much smile for the nation.
 My thoughts are with Steve's family, friends and coworkers. If a simple fan of his work like me that has never even met him feels so sad, I cannot imagine the sense of loss felt by those who were around him day by day.  And to Steve... Thank you for making the world a better place, for your innovation, thought leadership and passion. You will continue to inspire so many of us... Thank you and Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
At first, shock ...  ... then an emerging sorrow ...  ... finally Pride.  Steve Jobs' thoughts, ideas, plans,... goals ... still with us.  Mr. Jobs has left us .... and yet .... he is still very much at Apple.  Whispering, hoping, sometimes yelling outright.  He walks the halls of Infinite Loop. If we are lucky, he will stay ...  Sincerest Prayers for his family, friends, and colleagues.
I have had Apple computer's for 12 years now and absolutely love them.  I hope Apple will continue to push on as Steve would want them to and be the creative force of the personal computer world.  Good bye Steve.&nbsp;
I wish to extend my condolences to the family, friends and co-workers   of Mr. Jobs. He and his company are an inspiration.
I'm sitting here, a college student avoiding writing a paper, and I'm  amazed at the place Apple's technology has taken in my life. I'm writing  this email on my almost 3 yr old mac as jazz flows from my iPod to my  speakers and my iPhone lights up every so often with text messages and  reminders. All of these things, arguably the most important objects I  own, were all made by the same company, and in essence, by the same man. While Steve's body will cease to exist his mind, his ideas, his  philosophy will always live on. Not only through the technology that he  has taken from cold, and lifeless to something friendly and personal,  but in history as we will look back on the substantial growth of the  tech. industry placing Steve Jobs at the very forefront of ingenuity.  His name will echo for generations like Ford and Rockefeller. Thank you Steve, you are and will always be an inspiration.&nbsp;
Mr Steve Jobs. Thank you for all you have made for human kind. I  can describe you as one of the most valuable human beings in the  world. Thanks for everything.
The world is a much emptier place today.  While I never Knew Steve Jobs  up close an personal he has been in my life since I bought my first MAC  with all of its 128KB of Power.  AT some point I opened the case and  marveled at the insides and all those names with their signatures.  That  told me a whole lot about the man, Steve Jobs.  To get the machine I  went to the bank and borrowed $4500 to buy that machine and a printer.   The banker couldn't quite believe what I was doing as I could have  Bought a new Subaru for  close to the same amount.  Since then I have  bought Mac's IPhone, IPads when ever the need or the can't wait to get  my hands on that feeling Could only be satisfied with the purchase. I've  followed Steve in, out an back into of Apple with his detours in to Next  and Pixar.  His Vision and passion are unsurpassed.  All I can say is  Steve you'll be greatly missed.  For Tim, Phil, etc at Apple all I can  say is Think right Think different but do it right according to what you  think not the press.  And Congrats on the 4GS and SIRI  everyone will  get it eventually.   
While not unexpected, the news of your loss early this morning (in India) reminded us of the inevitable. Your innovative and creative life will continue to be a great example for the youngsters of today world-wide. May you rest in peace, and your family and close friends and associates find solace from the words of your admirers.
Thank you and your team, Steve. You had the guts and the vision to create magic. Peace brother.&nbsp;
My sympathies I want to say good luck at his family, we love you xxx He was an important men and he changed a lot of live with what he did.  (Sorry, I don’t speak english I do my best)
 Steve is the greatest source of inspiration in my life. It is very sad to see him go, but I'm committed to honoring him by working hard doing the things that I love, and making my work and my life as great as it can be. He will live on through us, the people whose life he touched deeply.   Thank you infinitely, Steve.   
Most of us did not know you personally but you  touched every single one of us.
Dear all,  I am so sorry that Steve Jobs passed away. I feel so sad. We lost a  genius, a vanguard and an artist. I am from China, and iPod is my first Iproduct. I got it when I was 15,  and now I am 21. From then on, Apple changed my life style. I got  iNano, iTouch, iPad, macpro and iPhone4. Mr Steve Jobs changed my life.  He made my life much easier.
He is not only a great innovator but a great teacher who inspires millions with his work and thought... RIP.. Steve Jobs.. the world will never be the same without you.
We would still be using DOS and purchasing vinyl records at Tower  Records.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for many, many years of satisfaction and excitement with  the products and the company you founded, and later rescued, from the hands  of lesser mortals. The moment I first saw a Mac, I packed up my Tandy  1000, put it in the closet and ordered a brand spankin" new Mac IIsi97 and  haven't looked back! Gonna miss you!&nbsp;
The world will mourn such a great visionary. His visions and products changed my life for the better. He will be sadly missed. My heart goes out to his family.
In the sixth grade I came across my first iPod. I couldn't believe how such a small device could conveniently store thousands of songs. I immediately put one on my Christmas list. After receiving that first piece of Apple technology, (first generation iPod nano) I fell in love with something more than just an MP3 player. I began looking more into Apple and researching everything it had created. In my late junior high years I used an iMac to produce a student news channel. I did not want to be an anchor on the show or sound person, I wanted to be controlling that incredible machine. I kept up to date with Apple, always watching Keynotes and staying in the loop on new products. Some may say it's an obsession, but it is a part of my life and I'm truly &nbsp;grateful for Apple.&nbsp; Now, midway through my senior year of high school I have decided to pursue a major in telecommunications when I go to college. I want to be able to correspond my career &nbsp;with Apple's innovative technology. Without Steve's amazing dedication to Apple from the beginning in the garage to after his resignation this year, I wouldn't have Apple in my life. Without Apple, I don't know what I would do with my life after high school. Thank you for keeping me motivated Steve. You said you wanted to put a ding in the universe, and you most definitely did. And trust me, we all thank you for it.&nbsp;  You will be missed,&nbsp;
Dear Apple and Steve's family,  Mr Jobs was an inspiration to me, and his company's products and the amazing  team he built have given my life great joy, and my career fresh legs.  This is a great loss for our industry, our country, and the world. His impact will be felt for generations, and his example will be cherished. My sincerest condolences. &nbsp;
I am saddened by this loss  I admired you and I will keep on admiring you for you holistic vision and for your strength, you were an inspiration and you leave big shoes to fill  My heartfelt condolences to the family.   
Thank you for your contribution for making the world a better place for all (the rest) of us.
 Certainly changed my world.  Outside of my immediate people only death that affected me this much was Lennon.  This one even more.  A true visionary as an entrepreneur, a business person-and a hard working visionary.  He changed the world.  Our country, our society, the world has lost someone way to early on par with Edison, Ford etc. All warped into one complex person who not only  saw the future but created it.&nbsp;
This is really sad!!! A big empty space. RIP!!!&nbsp;
All of us, users of Apple products, and also the few that do not have any of its products, share the same feeling as you guys do!  We are all thankful for what Steve and you have been offering to the world and for the new visions that you have been providing to it. Please make sure that you will continue to keep this outstanding work ongoing. &nbsp;
Clearly a legend, and inspiration to millions, this is one man who left the world knowing that he will be forever remembered. 
I am not an Apple product user but I am deeply saddened by this news. We lost an incredible visionary. We lost someone who was brave enough to see his vision through in changing the world. I'm not sure there's anyone else in the business world that I respect more than Steve Jobs.  He was such an incredible human being and I pray his spirit and vision will continue to thrive forward with Apple.  The world will miss you.&nbsp;
You were a great man. We will miss you Steve... rest in peace...
Undoubtedly I've lost a hero and a role model.  But I feel like I've  lost a friend.  Goodbye Steve. 
RIP, Mr. Jobs.   You were the most visionary person and will be greatly missed!  
Dear Apple and the billions of fans,  I am very sad to hear that Steve has passed away. My deepest condolences to your family and friends. You will always be remembered for your creative genius, and the billions of lives you have improved with your remarkable innovations. Wherever you are, I hope you rest in peace.&nbsp;
We will all miss you. Good luck in your next life. Thank you for all you gave.
We will never forget you Steve Jobs. You are a creative genius that has influenced the world in so many ways. May god bless you always. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I was shocked to learn the news, and feel that I have to say something. I am  sending this message with my iPad, an inseparable part of me. My life has changed for the better because of him.
Steve Jobs, where do I start. He was a innovator, trendsetter,   businessman and complete genius. Steve Jobs made me excited about   being part of Apple as a consumer. Waiting to see what the next   product being developed would be and where his vision was taking   Apple. He was a gift to the world. A rare jewel, who was a Superstar   on a global scale. To his family, friends, co-workers I send my   prayers and God Bless. Cherish the good times you had with him and   keep his vision and works going full steam ahead.&nbsp;
I am so proud to be a part of Apple and to have experienced the innovativeness of Steve Jobs.  I am an early adopter of Apple products, raised my children on Apple products and now I live Apple products.  Thank you so much for changing my life.  You will live on, in me, forever!  R.I.P.&nbsp;
Today the technological world lost its Da Vinci, its Einstein, its Lennon. He was this world's 9th wonder. You will be missed Steve but never forgotten, the mark you left on this universe will burn forever in the hearts and minds of everyone you inspired.
Back in 7th grade, I got my first iPod. 8th Grade was my first Macbook. 9th grade, my second iPod. 10th grade was the first time at the SF Apple Store. 11th grade, was my first iPhone. After senior year/first year of college, I got my second Macbook and a iPad. The whole reason I became an Apple fanboy was because of that first iPod, and without Steve, I would be stuck with something that isn't ingenious. On that note I end this by quoting The Onion, "I'll buy anything that's shining and made by Apple."
Mr. Jobs showed us all that your ideas and dreams can become brilliant, shining realities. May he truly rest in peace.
Thank you Steve, because of you my world always walks with me in my pocket...&nbsp;
Hello Apple team- I am very sorry for the loss of your incredible founder. It's true that he will always be remembered for revolutionizing the mobile phone, the way we buy &amp; listen to music, and what we expect from our personal computers. You all had the benefit of working with him, side by side, and the baton has now been passed to you. I think I can speak for many Apple lovers when I ask that you continue to manifest his vision, and carry his spirit of ingenuity into the future.
You will always remain in our memories &nbsp;&nbsp;
You're a Legend. May you rest in Peace! 
Today is a very sad day. May his family and Apple family find comfort in knowing that he has touched the lives of many of us in America. The world is a fun and better place because of his intelligence and he will be greatly missed. It is incredible that I did not personally know him but do feel deeply saddened. May God bless his family and may he rest in peace.
I am relatively new to apple products, but easily got addicted to the  ease of use of these products.  My frustration with complicated,  non-intutive products led me to apple. I could not believe that a  company, led by this "Steve Jobs" was so dedicated to making thing  "better " and "easier", and they stayed ahead of me. I loved it. I was  praying and hoping for a medical breakthrough for  him. Praying he would  get well.for himself, his family, his company and selfishly for  medical technology. I am a physician and with everything going  electronic in healthcare, the biggest frustration was "what technology  can not do" I was praying his team would fix electronic medical records  and hospital ordering systems. I am so sorry to hear of Mr. Job's death.  I can't imagine what those close to him must be going through. I hope  they find some comfort in knowing that there is a little bit of Steve  Jobs with so many of us. God give you peace and strength. God rest his  soul.&nbsp;
Ever since i got my macbook pro i have converted my whole life to using  apple products. Jobs was such a genius and a visionary. He knew what  people wanted. He thought like the general public. Everything works so  smoothly and is so smart. All of apples products are way ahead of their  time and Steve made it all possible.&nbsp;
The World just lost such a great man today... An inspiring genius, from a designer point of view, who pushed the boundaries of design and technology to accomplish so much. He created both visionary products but also the most respected company in the World. I hope Apple employees will honor this great man by continuing working on the track of their mentor.  Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
It is a sad day :(  Rest in Peace Mr Jobs!
Steve has been a blessing to us all. The world has been that much of a better place with his existence in it.   Farewell.
Steve, thank you for caring so much for the end user of technology! Usability and elegance are your trademarks. You and your vision pushed the envelope so many times. It has been one hell of a ride!
 I am a normal person in China. Your great product really changed my life a lot. You have changed the world. We will remember you forever!&nbsp;
My condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.     Steve has been my mentor in my life. You will be always remembered!
*Dear Mr. Steve Jobs, * * * *I just wanted to say thank you for creating the future for us. I don't know why it was you that had to be taken away, but loss happens to those who least expect it. Well, that's what i've figured out in life. I am only 12 years old, and I wanted to thank your parents for birthing you and for everyone in your life who helped you, help us with the next generation. I have never met you, but i have gone trick or treating at your house, and i was crying when i found out. That is how much you have affected this world. I though you might like to know that. My family lives by apple, so i wanted to thank you for that as well. I wish my condolences to your family, because i have gone through a loss before, and am now recovering from it, so i give you all the love that they need to pull through. We will never move on, but we will move forward. Thank you for your life Mr. Jobs. You will be greatly missed, and you are very loved&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve... thank you very much.  -- &nbsp;
 Thanks for changing my life on how i listen to music, communicate, and enjoy my everyday life. You surely will be missed.            
There are not enough words that could be said to  describe such a loss. You have made Apple such an amazing company.  That alone is an understatement. You've touched so many lives, and will never be forgotten. A genius is now in Heaven. I hope you continue to watch over those you love.&nbsp;
He lived his life each and every day. I will miss his  genius and inspiration. Steve was the Da Vinci of our times.&nbsp;
  Thank you for you talent to change the world profoundly, There is no illness in the heaven. Best wish to your families.&nbsp;
I never personally knew Steve Jobs.  The closest I ever came to crossing paths with him was when I was working in the Apple Building on Quail St., Costa Mesa in the early 90s.  However he touched my life in a very profound manner through his products, and every time I am on my computer, I am thankful that an innovator such as Steve Jobs shared my planet.  I have been a dedicated Apple/Mac user since 1997. Steve made sure that every product he created was user-friendly and inferior to no other.  I pray that his innovation will be enough to keep the company sharp and cutting-edge as it was under his keen eye.  Steve Jobs will be sorely missed.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
A very sad day.... he will be missed by many - including those like me   who never had an opportunity to meet him. 
    My deepest condolences. I am so saddened by the news.  Steve.....Thanks for all the enjoyment you have brought into my life with Apple. You will be missed by all.&nbsp;
Why so exceptional? Because the one who understood technology exists to convert simple dreams to reality. Hope this feeling is forever in Apple DNA. Merci Steve 
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone at Apple and the Jobs' family  at this very difficult time. All of us feel intensely connected to Steve each time we pick up our  iPhone, iPad or MacBook - it may be technology hardware, but each one  has the heart and soul that Steve gave it. And we will continue to love that feeling for a long, long time.  Thank you, Steve.
Thank you for changing the way we know technology and how we engage our society, you can finally rest. 
Today, the world is a little sadder, but a LOT brighter - thanks to the amazing drive Mr. Jobs gave to Apple, and the world.  His vision has affected not only Apple as a company, but as an extended worldwide family. Many of us have never met him, but we know him.  He showed us things we never dreamed of. His love of his 'baby' was infectious.  Right now, we all feel as if we lost someone near and dear to us. We have. But, his dream lives on, in us all.  To the family of Mr. Jobs, and to the company of Apple: my deepest condolences, and I'm sure that's going to be said by many others. The thing is, we all mean it.  I think the best way to honor him, is to move forward, keep creating, inventing, designing, singing... Dreaming.  All good wishes.
I was still in elementary school when I first used a Mac Plus. A friend  of the family was a Mac user and let us try his. We were hooked  immediately. My parents went out and bought the family a Mac SE. I  monopolized it. HyperCard was my favorite application. Much later in  life after I had graduated college, lost, and half-heartedly trying to  recover from drug addiction my parents took an enormous chance and gave  me a Power Mac G4 as a gift. It was the focus I needed again but this  time the web and the dev tools became my favorite application. A year  later Mac OS X came along and I was able to find a job working for a  company doing Mac stuff all day long and I haven't looked back since. At  an early age Steve's vision of technology changed my life and at a later  age Steve's vision of technology played a fundamental role in saving my  life. For that I am ever grateful because I am here now living my life,  not someone else's, doing interesting and creative things with  technology for humans every day. I still have both of those Macs.  Thank you Steve.
Steve will always be my hero for being the one to make me think different.  Sent from my iPad &nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your existence. You have been and will stay my inspiration forever. RIP.
Thank you Steve Jobs sir for all that you have done and continue to do  for humanity.
I would like to send my condolences to the family, friends, and  coworkers of one of the greatest minds of the century.  May God be with  you in these difficult times. 
I will follow my heart. I will always remember what you taught us.
Just would like to say thank you. We are the generation that is greatly influenced by you, and without a doubt you contributed greatly to history today. 
We are sorry about Steve Jobs’ death. He is inspiring me to build a company that "think different." Thank You Steve, You are the salt to this world, may God be with You.
I felt I had to write some memories I have in regards to Apple because  I'm really saddened by the loss of one of the biggest visionaries of our  time. I've been an Apple user ever since I was a little girl (I'm 20  now). My first own laptop was the iBook 3G (a blue clamshell) but my  family has a whole bunch of Apple computers, some dating back to the  early 90's. Apple has had such an influence on me growing up. Every time  someone in my family would get a new Apple product, we'd sit down  together and figure it out. We all even have iPhones and love it.  Thank you Steve Jobs for everything you've done for my family and I.  You've really brought us together and showed us a different way of  thinking.&nbsp;
The Beatles changed music forever...  Steve Jobs changed the world forever... 
We are very saddened by this news. The world will celebrate the gift of Mac, Apple and inspiration for perfection by Steve Jobs. Our condolences to the company and his family.&nbsp;
Thanks, Steve, for leaving this world a much better place, making it  easier for all of us to express and share our thoughts, and to keep in  Touch.  Enjoy the "Cloud."&nbsp;
Mr Jobs, I will miss you immensely. You have always been a hero of sorts to me, someone who was able to rise against odds, and find success in the face of competition before even competing. You are an inspiration. You have a good heart.&nbsp;
The genius behind the designs, the spirit of Apple.  This iconic man will be missed, but something tells me, if there is something beyond this life, he'll be running the show in no time, and soon, there will be organization and ease of use in the universe, and it'll look sleeker than ever.   
 You are not dead. Your soul is stock in every apple device and that makes apple even more sophisticated. I would never say bye, but forever I'll say thanks. Thanks for being a such a great influence to my life, you are  one of my inspirations in life. Thank you Mr. Revolutionary Man. 
Thanks Steve.   you'll live forever in our hearts.  
I had feared this day.  I am so sad. We have lost a person that not only changed our lives, but inspired an entire world.&nbsp;
Steve, You were a true visionary. Your products and ideals revolutionized the  world that we live in. As a developer, I will do my best to uphold your  standards of perfection in my own creations. You will be missed.&nbsp;
A creative inspiration to all mankind.  Sent from one of Steve's iPods 
When I heard the news I froze.  I went straight to my room and sat on my bed just motionless, i was in so much shock i could not move.  Right now as i am writing this i am still so shocked.  Best wishes to Apple Inc and the new CEO of Apple.&nbsp;
I'd just like to thank Mr. Jobs for his presence and contribution to life on this planet.  His vision has changed the way we think, play, interact and work.  Steve, I feel fortunate to have been able to benefit from your vision, and you have laid the groundwork for generations to come.&nbsp;
Please accept my deepest sympathies. I am very very shock and  sad. I love Macintosh PC, Mac OS.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Dear All,  I am sad to know that Apple had lost its founder and creative genius. &nbsp;Steve is one of the most admired IT gurus in the world. &nbsp;Founding Apple, NeXT, Pixar and creating a family of innovative devices - iPod, iPhone, iPad, etc.  Steve will certainly be missed, but his spirit and creativity will live forever in our hearts.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was truly a genius. Steve had great vision and brought the company back. Although I personally did know Steve Jobs, we will definitely miss him and condolence from my family go out to Steve Jobs' family.
I have never met steve &amp; he me,but through books &amp; the internet over the last 10 years I did know who he was and what he has done for the apple,the USA &amp; The World.I became astounded at his visionary powers for apple users,his story &amp; periodically i would update myself on his position of influence within the computer industry, and inturn the world.  It was with sudden disbelief I read his sign off date on google, then with sadness his dedication page at apple.Yes what a sad loss as many but at least he got to express and share some of his genius &amp; potential. I hope his legacy continues through his family.   Arohanui to Laurene &amp; the Children. My prayers are with you, God Bless you all and thank you for sharing Steve with us &amp; the World.
You have really touched my heart in so many ways and truly are a visionary of the future, my condolences to your family&nbsp;and friends.&nbsp;
Steve,  The ideas that came out of your head changed my world.&nbsp;
Thank you for dreaming aloud, dreaming in fast forward and for leaving a  legacy for all of us can admire eternally.
RIP Steve. Your pain is over. Our Prayers are with your family.&nbsp;
 The whole world will miss Steve Jobs. I feel so sad using a phone that he created.
I feel like I lost an old friend. Steve, you have been like a mentor to me. Everything you've done, you've done right.  You lived life happy, and did what you pleased.  You are the man Steve, I'm gonna miss you!&nbsp;
Thanks Steve for the magic, the vision, and because of all the dreams you make us to begin dreaming with your genius.&nbsp;
We will all ask the question, "What were you doing when you heard the news that Steve Jobs had died?" And I will always remember how I felt first, and that I was viewing my first video download on iPhoto of my precious animal friend, flipping high in the air over a thrown toy. Joy is companion to grief.&nbsp;
You owned and founded from a garage the richest company in the world, richer then the US government, that make the best computers in the world. Not only that, but you were an amazing person and great human visionary.Thats quite an accomplishment. Rest in Peace. 
Thank you for having the courage to following your vision.  You will be  missed. Condolences to all family and friends; your loss is all of ours.
Although I was only the age of 7 when Steve first announced the iPod, I recognized the revolutionary impact it was going to have on not only the music industry, but the world. Gone were the days of carrying around my portable CD player, where the Spice Girls would loyally skip every minute. Hello to the future.  Steve, you were revolutionary, and will be sorely missed.
My family extends our condolences to Steve's family, friends, and Apple co-workers. Thank you for making our lives better and in such incredibly innovative ways.  Rest in peace.
Thanks for bringing Apple into my life. Rest in peace you genius. 
I send my deepest condolences to the Jobs family and to all his close  friends. Innovation is what distinguishes between leaders and  followers and Steve you definitely showed that to the world. Thanks  for all the the pleasures and joys you have brought to my life and to  millions of others. You will never be forgotten 
 You and your products changed lives forever!  What an incredible legacy!  Thank goodness we know that families will be together forever!&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for your passion and contributions to change the way we live, you will be sorely missed. May God's comfort and peace be with your family and friends.
I would like to express my deepest condolences to Steve Jobs' family and friends.  I never got to meet Steve but am inspired by him and his contributions to the world.  I have always admired him as a living legend in the computer industry.  I made my decision to become an independent iOS developer after watching Steve's Stanford commencement address.  If it was not for Steve, I would not be doing what I love today.  He has made a huge contribution to society and the world and will forever be remembered.  Steve will be truly missed...
It's hard to measure the scope of even a single persons influence, but Steve has profoundly changed the lives of people living around the world. Embracing simplicity and emotion in everything he touched, and through it, everyone.&nbsp;
My ultimate ambition was to eventually work for the man who inspired me to 1. Graduate from HS 2. Attend College 3. Touch people in the way that he did. He will live forever in the hearts of all mankind.
Your dreams helped shape the modern world and even though your body might have left us, your spirit remains in our hearts and minds. The world is a bit poorer today.&nbsp;
His brilliance was unmatched.  I once told my daughter that I was in love with another guy in addition to her father.  With alarm she asked who it was. My answer was simple Steve Jobs.  She chuckled and said warmly, I think you can tell dad.  He would understand.  I have been a Apple loyalist from the early 1980's when I pretended that the G4 I was buying for Christmas was for our then 2 year old daughter.  I wanted to play with the new toy!  Have been playing with Apple toys ever since. To Steve's family, a special thanks for sharing him with the rest of the world.&nbsp;
To the family of Mr. Jobs and the apple family, My heart felt condolences to you.
Steve, You made technology fun!  Thanks for bringing a smile to me when working and playing.&nbsp;
I cannot express how very sorry I was to learn the sad news. I appreciate from the bottom of my heart. Our thoughts and prayers are with you. Thank you very very very much Steve.   
 As I type with my macbook, listen to my iPod, and text people with my iPhone... I can hardly believe that the man responsible for all this innovation is gone. My condolences to his family, friends, and coworkers. He will be missed not just by them and me, but the entire world will mourn him.
iSteve, iAll ipeople iwill iremember iyou iaround iworld. iThank iyou iso imuch ifor idedicated iyour ilife ito iturn iour ilife ibetter!
The vision of this genius of a man will live on with the positive hunger  for creativity and innovation of us who have loved and cherished the MAC  and Apple products since the late eighties. Condolences to his family  and the employees of Apple.
The world remember Albert Einstein because he discovers why the Apple fell down and everyone will remember Mr Steve because he creates with his Apple a product of the future, impressive and much much better than competitors.   
Steve Jobs was a visionary and pioneer in the information technology era. He will be remembered for long-long time... my deepest condolences to the Jobs family and the Apple family Mr. Jobs created.
I just wanted to thank Steve Jobs for his creations. He improved and   simplified my families' lives. Thank you again, our condolences to his family and friends.
Thank you Steve,  For changing our world.  Rest in Peace.
 Thanks Steve, for being among us.  Thanks GOD, to have let me live while Steve was here.  Take care of him. He's a very special guy!!! 
My deepest sympathies to his family.  The world has lost a great man.  If all major corporations followed just a quarter of Steve's morals they would all be better off.  He will be greatly missed by those who knew him personally and those who didn't.  RIP Steve.
I am very saddened by our loss of Steve Jobs  May God Shine his Light on Him.  My Prayers go out to his family and friends.  I will remember his "Brown Bag Lunches" in the Conferance Room on Bandley Drive.&nbsp;
I am a Mac thanks to Steve Jobs. Our prayers are with his family and the whole Apple family. Thank you for everything you do to make our life better. He was truly special.&nbsp;
Thank you for sharing your vision with us. You changed animation, personal computing, customer service and communications for all of us. Your innovation  was the catalyst for change in countless industries and companies that tried to keep up. All consumers reaped the benefits. Blessing to Steve's family for sharing him with the world.  Condolences to all who worked with, knew and loved him. Steve Jobs will be missed.
RIP Mr. Jobs. Your inventions touch our lives every day. You made computers fun and easy to use for not only for children all over world but for grown ups as well. Your legacy and inventions will stay for generations. THANK you for that. &nbsp;Peace
Words cannot express my feelings. &nbsp;Steve and Apple  made our life easy and efficient. &nbsp; RIP Jobs  condolences  to Apple and Jobs family and friends.
I am writing this on my iPad thanks to Steve. The great vision of Steve Jobs  brought the future to us. He invented things we didn't even know we wanted and once we got them in our hands we knew we could never live without them. Thank you for leaving the world a better place.&nbsp;
I am from Guatemala, and even though my country isn't the most developed  one I have been following Apple since I was in 6th grade. I briefly want  to express my deepest condolence because Steve Jobs was one of my role  models (one of the few actually), he was a human being that really  exuded confidence, trust, and most of all a good will to help others. He  will be remembered forever in every generation from now on, his work  will never be forgotten and it will inspire others as it has inspired  me; his humbleness and good intentions will be guidelines for the future  human beings.&nbsp;
My heart just stopped, and I never knew the man. He did a great job of living, didn't he! That so many know of him and have been impacted by his presence. That is success. RIP Mr. Jobs 
as I sit here and type this on my apple computer I realize the true genius of Steve Jobs! It is safe to say he will not be forgotten, truly unfortunate that he passed way before his time! a modern day pioneer and a visionary that may never be matched and or surpassed.
Dear Steve, they say you changed the world.  All I know is, you changed mine.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I was never fortunate enough to personally interact with Mr. Jobs, but  my friends and I would watch his presentations of apple products and be  stunned at what this man accomplished. I was even more impressed with  the quality of his presentation. Nobody could deliver a keynote address  like Steve, and watching has inspired me to be more creative with my own  ideas, and be a better presenter. The world lost a great man today, but  as a friend told me when I lost my father, "God never closes one door  without opening another." I would like to wish Steve's friends and  family my sincerest condolences.
My sincere condolences to all who knew Steve personally, as well to all  those who knew of him by reputation.  The world has lost a visionary. While our thoughts go out to his family  and friends at this time, we are also hoping that his legacy lives on.  The world needs Apple and the innovation it produced.
  I offer all my deepest condolences to the Steve Jobs family. I haven't felt this sad in a long time.   Rest in peace Steve and have fun innovating heaven. &nbsp;
Heaven just got even cooler.&nbsp;
Lost Jobs, technology remains the spirit he left behind. For many people with ease and progress is left grieving Jobs.  Pray eternal sleep. 
...but by the places and moments that take our breath away." Steve did that for many of us!&nbsp;Steve will go down with the greats, he has changed the way we communicate and work. He has made moving forward so exciting, I have watched Steve's growth and he has always amazed me, I know that around the world he will be missed for a very long time.     To his family just know that Steve was loved not only for what he gave us but for who is was and his amazing intuitiveness for the rest of us and knowing exactly what we wanted and what we needed....Thank You Steve for all you have given us.   My last quote on this page say is all...Steve took our breath away  not only once but so many times!&nbsp;
If God sent Michael Jordan to teach us  about the basketball, then he sent  us Steve to teach us about  simplicity and beauty. To me, the world would  never be the same, ever...&nbsp;
I am 54 years old.  In all those years no  public figure has ever inspired me the way that Steve Jobs has.  He was  something different.  Over the past 20 years I have bought many Apple  computers and when I made that purchase I wasn't just buying a product I  was buying something that had life in it.  It always felt as if the  people at Apple poured their life into it.  Steve poured his life into  it.  And all those Apple products connected me to that feeling and made  me feel more human.  Steve will never die because he will live on in the light and energy and  wonder that pours out of all that Apple is and all that Apple will  become. As Steve has said before we are not here forever.   I do believe that  it's about what you leave behind and on that count what Steve Jobs has  left behind is truly magical.
My condolences to his family and a sad hug to all the Apple employees. The TV reports are missing a big one: Hypercard. I remember when it came out bundled with my MacII. It opened my eyes and brain and my life was never the same. It's true that Tim Berners-Lee invented  the World Wide Web, but Steve created the hypertext meme which was prior to the Web and I daresay made it possible.&nbsp;
My prayers go out to all of Mr. Jobs loved ones. It's never easy losing a loved one... He definitely put that ding in the universe! What a wonderful legacy to leave behind...&nbsp;
Hello,  Such a coincidence - I had just finished reading a book about Steve last night here in Okinawa, Japan.  As I closed the book, the news broke in: the story of perhaps the most innovative person on earth ended.  I am not sad at all.  However, I feel this "emptiness" in my heart.  I am not sure what I could do to fill that emptiness, and probably others are feeling the very same.  All I can think of is nothing, nothing at all.  Maybe I am feeling an incredible amount of sadness so my brain is has stopped functioning.  Yet.....I think Steve Jobs will live forever in our heart.  He will keep inspiring the next generation as the most innovative creator of all just like he kept inspiring us for years.  The last thing Steve saw was the release of iPhone 4S.  I call it iPhone for-Steve.    Rest in peace, Steve.
Thank you, Steve For making products, that were fun every step of the way. I am sorry we could not what is next from you but I feel extremely lucky to have lived during your tenure at Apple, Next and Apple again.  Oh and thanks for making the base to my businesses over the years.  I made lots of money and saved considerable sums using your computer over the competition. &nbsp;RIP. No one else could have done what you did.
I never met the man, but always wanted to.  I have had the privilege of watching Steve's entire career, and buying many of his "projects".  In everything I always saw that his vision was his driving force, and very little stopped him attaining that vision.  He changed every market he got involved with and was never stopped by "it can't be done".    I feel there is no question that this spirit will be carried on proudly by Apple for many years to come.  This loss to the world is a big one. Steve and his impact on all of us will never be forgotten.  My sincerest thought and prayers go out to all his family and friends.
 I am 55 years old.  I own and Apple iPhone and iPad. I use both all day long, and it makes me a better communicator.  I take awesome pictures of my grandchildren and immediately post or store.  I would never have the collection I do without my iPhone, it's the best thing I have ever owned.  I have followed Steve Jobs through the years and was beyond impressed.  He was a genius and from what I have read, a really good guy.  This is a huge loss for many, many people.  My sympathy and prayers go out to his family and the Apple Family.  God Bless.&nbsp;
Thank you for all you have done for technology. Our world is a better place because of you and you will forever be missed.
... U are my example for all...  Ever changing the normal thinks to natural thinks...
Hello APPLE family,  Please give my sincere condolences to Steve's family. Steve changed my life with his genius, for life without APPLE would not  be the same. What a great man. What a terrible loss. What a sad day.
No words. Thank you Steve.
I bought my first Apple product, an iPhone 3G, back in 2008 and was so smitten with it that it made me want to learn about new ways of doing things. &nbsp;So I bought Apple's other products like the MacBook Pro. I was so impressed with the system that I had to learn more about how it came to be and so I learned about Steve Jobs. His drive, beliefs and dedication. We were honored to have your inspiration affect our lives.  My condolences to the family. 
Steve Jobs was an idol of mine since I was very young. I have been honored to work at Apple helping to give the great support we are known for for three years now and have loved it. Working for Apple under Steve's leadership and vision has been a privilege and life changing experience for me. The world has lost a visionary and genius and will never be the same. Rest in Peace, my hero and mentor.&nbsp;
1984- my first experience with the 512 k enhanced computer- changed   my working life forever. A truly Great man- a true visionary. As the leader of our Apple   family - he will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
As an iPad user and Apple-holic, I can't help sending this email to you. I'm  so sad that Mr. Jobs passed away. I remember listening to his speech for graduate students at Stanford and I printed out the script and read it again and  again. He is such an influential person not by a fame but by his honest effort and love to his work. He is our family for who made our life better and meaningful. Love you all who helped him and helps him to shine his way.
Steve Jobs was a man with a vision and the future of technology! he was  able to change todays technology so quickly and efficiently! steve jobs  is and always will be in inspiration towards this generation! may he  rest in peace! You will be missed by many! 
 Steve Jobs was both a visionary and a great entrepreneur and inspired many people. In college, he   studied on his professional life and affectionately nicknamed Uncle Jobs. I sincerely hope that the family and the company (Apple company) go through this painful moment, a single day without forgetting who he was and what is represented and for all! My most sincere condolences!
Dear Steve   I don't believe you died, you have changed the life of the world,  and the world has lost an amazing human being.  I will miss you forever.&nbsp;
What a shock and what a loss to the world. He was a visionary.  Prayers and comfort to friends and family. 
 The creativity and love of Steve is a legacy for mankind.&nbsp;
 A rebel, an icon and a genius. My life would be so different without  his brilliance. The world has lost one of the greatest visionaries of  all times. The world will never be the same.
He made the world think different.  
I never met Steve but he has been an integral part of my life and life  as we know it.  The fulfillment of his vision brought life to the  creative visions of this generation and generations to come.  His foot  print in the digital stratosphere will endure and for this I say  ....Thank you.  You will be missed and remembered.
Even though I have never met Steve and know only a tiny fraction of his story, I am deeply saddened by his passing. He has positively affected my life on a daily basis and I cannot thank him enough for his leadership, innovation, and courage. Thank you Steve!
Departure of Steve Job brings tears in my eyes. The loss to the world is not  replaceable. His Contribution to the world is comparable to that of Leonardo de Vinci. My heart felt condolences to Steve's family and Apple family.
Dear Steve Jobs thank you so much for revolutionizing our world. we are better human being because of you. to me, you are eternal. forever thank you. much love.
Steve,Thanks from the bottom of my heart for being an individual. For pushing  the world forward. And for being a shining example of humanity at its  best. You are missed and loved by many.
 A genius will be so forever. Goodbye, Steve.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs put such excitement into buying an Apple product. Our condolences to his family, colleagues and everyone who will miss him. 
Only time will tell how many more millions of people he influenced. A great leader, visionary  that created history. 
Today we lost a Great American.  Condolences to his family and his apple   family. Rest in peace Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve...you were a brilliance of our time and will be  dearly missed by all! 
 Thanks for all the innovation, vision and talent ... but above all, thanks for the inspiration ...  I will continue hungry, I'll still be foolish, I will think differently...  Rest in peace&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the kind of person who will be remembered forever, not only as a  creative genius, but as an amazing human being.&nbsp;
RIP Steve, you left a legacy that will last for many generations&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for your creative ambitions!  You set the bar high.  We will miss you.  I'm not much of an emotional person but I'm truly sad by your death.  I  hope you believed in a higher power and are in Heaven.  I know my heaven has you in it.
一个伟大的人走了，虽然令人伤感，但是要坚强 
 The world is not the same today.Terrible, terrible loss for all humanity.He fought until the very end, like he always did. So young, so many things he still wanted to do, why life is so unfair? My condolences to his family, friends and to his Apple family.            
I will always remember Steve Jobs. He will always have a place in my heart, as the face of Apple. Every time we share the same birthday I'll remember him, and suffer a sweet nostalgic melancholy as I think about what he has done for Apple, and his impact of being this colossal icon throughout my life. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs, you've always been there and you always will in my memory. 
My sincere condolences to the family.  Just today I was reading quotes  from Steve Jobs.  I love his commencement address at Stanford in 2005.   Steve changed the world in BIG ways.  His gift to the human race has  pushed us all forward.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has shaped and affected so much of my life. I don't even know what to say. I am so sorry for his family's loss. Thank you so much for everything Steve. Truly. You have left this world a better place and have changed the world in an infinite amount of ways. 
I'm from china. I must tell you people from china thank you so much. we will miss you forever when we take out our iPod iPhone iPad Touch...Thank you!
Back in high school, we were asked to write an essay on dreams. I wrote about my dream to work with Steve Jobs at Apple one day. Hitherto I was really driven by that desire to achieve, to make an impact. As I read the posts on my dash on Tumblr this morning, I felt like a part of me has died. Steve Job has always signified my dream, my goal in life. Now, his death keeps hammering my heart and I feel like I am slowly falling in a deep dark well of despair and darkness. He was just 56! 
We will miss you steve,  Your  were a genius,  your work will be  remembered through end of time.
To say he changed the world is an understatement. This man changed every  single persons' lives. He was a genius in every way and such a devoted  man. May he rest in peace and continue to change lives.
Steve has served as an inspiration to my generation, a true success story in  that he rolled the dice backed on what he felt was right and what would succeed. From my first apple product at age 11 in 6th grade, to today at 16 as I write this on my iPad, I've been delighted and have admired Jobs. May he  rest in peace.
It is always so hard to lose some one you care about. My thoughts and  prayers are with you during your journey. As a customer I am so grateful  for the work that your company has allowed me to do. I am able to sign  up for internet classes knowing that when I turn on my computer that  glorious apple will appear and all will be well. Thank you Steve Jobs  for the work you did in relieving the stress of thousands of college  students world wide.
My condolences to all involved. We all lost a remarkably innovative man. I was brought up a PC user, had never seen or used a Mac up until about 5 years  ago, Steve single handedly brought me to come to love Apple and all of it's  products. I watched a presentation that he did about the iPod touch and at first it was not even the product that brought me in, it was his presentation . The way that he pitched the product made me want one, and now sitting here  penning this email on my favorite go-to gadget I am surrounded by other amazing Apple products all brought to me by him. Thank you Steve and may you rest in peace.
If it wasn't for Steve I would not be typing on this very computer I am  proud to own. He had such a positive impact on the world, and created a  revoulution for the better. 
Apple has been the foundation of every work I've done since I was 14  years of age. I've been following Steve Jobs career and working for apple authorized  stores in Brazil for the most part of my life and now I manage the apple  labs in a college. I've been pushing apple at people and helping my friends moved from  a  pc to an Apple for 16 years now (or more). &nbsp;I would always say that "I'm giving you my mechanic point of view, and I  know what Steve Jobs puts under the hood of these babies. So go with an  Apple- I can help you." Heck my last xmas present from my fiance was a book about his life. Well, I will miss the man that was my indirect boss for almost &nbsp;years. Thank you for all the inspirations Mr. Jobs and all you cool people at  Apple.&nbsp;
 Dear Mr.Jobs     Thank you for your iPhone.It's changing the world,also changing lots of people's living style.I will always remember what your iPhone bring me,the beauty and the feeling.It's really an excellent production.thank you.I believe your company and successor will bring more remarkable productions to us in the future.     May you rest in peace.
Steve Jobs lived with passion everyday, he will always be an inspiration for all the world. Thank You Mr. Jobs for changing the world, thank you for your passion, for your dedication to make great things and for teaching us how life should be lived. "Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes... The ones who see things differently... You can praise them, disagree with them.. quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they Change Things. They Invent, They imagine, They heal,... They inspire! They push the human race forward. Because the people who are crazy enough to think, they can change the world, are the ones who do." MR JOBS, THANK YOU FOR PUSHING THE HUMAN RACE FORWARD! MY DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO HIS FAMILY.
Steve Jobs made what's impossible possible. His influence and contribution is probably equal or even higher than any U.S. president in modern history. And I am so glad that I have Steve Jobs in my generation. You will be in our hearts forever, Steve!
I just want to say that, I remember the first computer I touched (84') it changed my life. Because of the time and location were I went to school they did not understand learning disabilities, I believe that if it was not for that day I would have never made it through school or been able to accomplished as many things as I have, it has allowed me to help many people like me. Thank you Steve... *RIP*
I would like to express my deepest condolences to the family of Steve  Jobs and wish them the strenght they need in this difficult time. 
My condolences goes out to a man who helped change the world.  His exemplary life is a model for future generations to follow.
We will miss you're wonderful and visionary ideas and you perfect sense of perfection RIP Steve.
We have lost one of the most visionary, cutting edge and creative people who has ever lived, period. All the best!&nbsp;
To the family and coworkers of Mr. Jobs: Although I never had the honor of meeting Mr. Jobs in person, I am extremely saddened by your loss and my condolences go out to you at this difficult time.  Throughout his life, Mr. Jobs demonstrated determination and perseverance, and his work has benefitted society immensely.  From a young age, I have enjoyed Apple products; my grandmother first taught me how to use her Mac LC when I was six years old.  When I have encountered hurdles during my own life and education, I have looked to Mr. Jobs as a role model and source of inspiration.  He truly has had a positive impact on my life and I will always remember him as I learn the art of medicine.&nbsp;
You and your words always in my heart and my mind... rest in peace Steve... we love u!&nbsp;
Only one thing. Steve Jobs was an hero. He revolutionized much more than people have realized. I express my deepest condolences for the person who changed the life of  everyone.&nbsp;
I am very sad to hear of this news, even though we knew he is suffering, we can not accept it. He is a hero, a great leader in IT field in the world. I have knew him for about 8 years since I bought  iPod-nano, we miss him and we will remember him all the time. sincerely the faithful customer.
Not often do you cry for a man you never met. Just did. The world will miss your creativity and vision. May you legend live on... 
You will be sadly missed. You were a great man leading great people to make the world a great place. I felt better knowing that my new born son will grow up in a world where products that you have created will enhance his life and hopefully inspire him to create and innovate the way you have.  The world is a now a little more empty now that you are gone but a greater place for having you in it. Deepest sympathies.
Few will ever shine as bright as Steve did. The world has lost more than just a man. The world has lost a great thinker, a great explorer, leaving behind a great example, a great legacy. This very world has changed, because of this one mind. Stars will come to an end, their light will fade away. Physically Steve may have left us. But unlike stars, Steve will continue to look down upon us, shining ever so bright. Great men may die, great minds will live on forever. R.I.P. Steve
My deepest love and appreciation from Colombia for a huge human being!!!!  R..I.P.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!  God bless you!!! :( :( :(
A true innovator and inspiration to people around the world. Rest in peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I was 15 in 1987, the very first time I saw a Macintosh... and that was it: love at first sight.  Apple computers and the amazing brilliance of Steve Jobs had been part of most of my life. I've used Apple inventions since then. I'm an insanely Apple believer and MacEvangelist. As a journalist and college professor, I've taught thousands of people what Apple products can do, in a country where Macs were the the exception rather than the norm...   But we prevailed because we are not computer users, we're Mac users. My thoughts and prayers to his wife, family and beloved ones. Journalist &amp; Mac user since 1987.
I love what you have done for the world! You have always seem to create something bigger and better for the advancement of Apple and the world. I pray for your family and your corporation; that not only they keep you in their hearts but their minds as well so that they may follow in your foot steps and show the world that we can make a change. Steve Jobs, we will forever miss you... Thank you for sharing with us your knowledge and love!&nbsp;
Hi Apple! He will be surely missed here in the Philippines. May he rest in peace. We will pray for his humble soul. He is trully a great man with a great heart! Thanks steve for inspiring us! We love you!
If it weren't for Steve Jobs, I'd never have become a graphic designer and loved my work so much.
RIP SJ, It was a privilege working for Apple while you were there. Your visionary genius was unparalleled, and you changed the world like no other man I have known.
i didn't know him, (i am only twelve), but i had to do a project on someone who created something and i chose him. i presented it today, and i am just glad that he got to hear the things i said before he died. after learning sooooooo much about him, it was my dream to meet him. when i came to apple.com i started to cry when i saw that he passed. i hope that he r.i.p. Steve jobs, you will be dearly dearly missed.
Thank you Steve and God bless. Condolences to Steve's family and his extended Apple family. He will be deeply, deeply missed.
Steve Jobs' innovation even contributed to the economic development of some developing countries. RIP Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I just want to say how shocked I was to hear this, Steve Jobs was a truly great man, inspirational to all of us and we are  all in debt to him. Condolences to his family and friends. He will never be forgotten, always remembered as the man that changed the world and the way people  live in it.
You are an awesome genius. Words cannot describe the impact you have had. Sad to see you move on into the next phase of your Life, yet happy for what lies ahead for you.&nbsp;
I never was an apple fan but thanks to Steve Jobs, he pushed the boundaries of the technological world. Thanks Steve Jobs and rest in peace. 
He will be missed in this house.  The only computers I have owned have been from Apple.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is not dead, he is immortal. He'll live forever between us.  He was a genius and an amazing human being, his life is an example for  all, he was a fighter.  He'll live forever in our hearts.
To the apple family and Steve Jobs family:  Thank you for all the hard work and sharing your ideas with the whole. I am married and have two little kids, 4 and 2, and there is not a day that goes by that we do not benefit from the products that Apple has created and that Steve has dreamed up. My kids are little. They do not understand how revolutionary the iPhone, iPad, and all of the other products and services that enrich their every day lives. We teach reading, math, science to our kids from the iPad. We teach our kids the Bible and the teachings of what we believe and it's all so easy and exciting with the iPad.   I truly believe that God inspires great men and women to do great things. But so often most of us do not take that opportunity to follow that inspiration. I'm so grateful for Steve Jobs, that he did follow the promptings and ideas that, I believe, came from up above to enrich and bless the lives of all.   I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you and I will continue to support Apple and great innovations that hopefully will continue to come.   Thank you!&nbsp;
Steve,  I will miss your vision, foresight and passion in every Apple product you created. Rest easy and know that your work will last forever.  
Steve Jobs will always be the pinnacle  of what can be accomplished by human  drive. His work and his vision will usher in a new age in innovation even in his absence his legacy will live not only through his work and products but through all the lives he touched creating them. You will be missed
I can't think of many ways that the ideas of Steve Jobs has not touched my life.  As a writer, a cook, a teacher, and a mother,  I use his products every day.  I rely upon them for order and productivity.  The man may have left this world, but his legacy lives on.  Shalom, Mr. Jobs.  Peace to you.
World lost a very "Hungry and Foolish" man today. But he inspired a generation to be hungry and foolish. RIP Steve.&nbsp;
I'd like to thank you for a legacy, unmatched during all time.  God bless.&nbsp;
 Deepest condolences to Steve's family. Steve's impact on all our lives will remain legendary for a very very long time. His Stanford commencement address  has had a profound positive impact on my life. He was true to himself like no one else. May Steve's soul rest in peace.  
I am so very sad to know that Mr. Jobs has died. My deepest and sincerest sympathy to his family and his co-workers. He was a great man of extraordinary vision.&nbsp;
I am very very sorry for your loss.  God bless 
Dear Family, Friends and Colleagues of Steve Jobs, My son who is only 11 years old had tears in his eyes and  covered his face when he heard the sad news. He loves, understands and very interested in APPLE technology!!! He  always watched Steve Jobs' "Apple Event", and he wants to know  everything about Apple. He knows the story of Steve Job's life! If we ask something about the  operation of the Apple Computer or iPhone he answers our question. This summer as we were coming home from a vacation from Northern  California, our son asked us to stop in Cupertino, just to see the Apple  Headquarters.  We are grateful for Steve Jobs!  Our hearts are broken!  We are wishing the best to His Family! <br>
I feel like I lost a friend. You made my life better through innovation.   You'll be missed but not forgotten, ever.&nbsp;
I would like give my condolence to his family and to everyone that has being  touch by the death of a great visionary. May you rest in peace. You will be  miss.
I am proud to say that I was part of the APPLE FAMILY...  I worked for Apple out of the Bellevue Washington store.  I was so excited and thrilled to be part of something that I loved so much. Every customer that walked though the door I could not wait to show them how our products could really change there lives.   When a customer came in frustrated that they could not do something I was just as excited to put a smile on there face.    I learned so much as a Apple Employee but what I learned the most is that there is always a way to make a difference.    My thoughts and prayers go out to this wonderful man and his family.  Once a Apple Family Member always a Apple Family Member.
I go way back with apple and have always been so impressed by Steve his visionary mind set is warm way he spoke in releasing a product. What his ideas have done to this world will always be remembered he truly was one of the greats. He is at peace now with no more pain may he rest in peace for all the rest of the days.
 He was a genious.  A song from a another genious man come in my mind " imagine" from John Lennon.&nbsp;
I had the opportunity to visit Cupertino when I was training to be a Genius at an Apple Store. I saw Steve 3 times when I was out there. The first day, before I was issued my badge. Later that first week when I saw him in the cafeteria. The last time I saw Steve was when I held the door for him. We are close to the same height but in my memory he was a giant. I was gobsmacked when I held the door for him, I nodded and he nodded back. We didn't exchange words, but then I realized he was &nbsp;just like me. He happened to be CEO of Apple Inc. but we were both two people going to lunch.&nbsp;
I originally began using computers back in second grade. I grew up with your systems even into high school when I got a LC of my own.  I moved up and wound up receiving a IIfx from someone my dad worked for.  Even in high school, with access to Windows machines, I still preferred Mac.  I bought an Ipod when they came out and had the thing for almost 5 year until it finally died.  I was upset for days when that happened.  Anyway, Mr. Jobs, you will be missed. May you ascend upon the wings of angels to eternal rest.&nbsp;
Forever "The Game Changer". Thank you for changing the world. He did so  much with so little time. 
We are very sad to hear this news.  Steve Jobs was an inspiration to so many.  In fact, my son and I talked about his illness and hoped for a miracle.  Steve will truly be missed.  We can only be grateful that we were able to share in his vision and creations.  He will be forever in my thoughts.
I can't think of any other person as influential to the world in the  technology than Steve Jobs. The products he envisioned were truly  revolutionary and welcomed by the public. I wish there could be a way  for all of us to thank him for his work, its unmatched.
Steve Jobs has touched my life and affected it in many ways...  May your RIP you mastermind, and thank you for everything you have  done... the world would not have been the same without you  iLoveyou 
I remember watching my first Keynote as an Apple employee. I remember seeing Steve on stage and being captivated by his enthusiasm and pride for what he was doing. It was humbling and inspiring at that moment to realize the incredible opportunity I have working for Apple. What Steve has created has enriched my life, the life of my family and introduced me to some of my lifelong friends. Thank you, Steve.
Thank You Steve Jobs for making my life more Fun at home and at work.  Your contributions to human life will live forever!
I’m a student of engeneering, from Brazil and just want to say that I believe that there's two kind of people in the world: Those who love and know how great was Steve Jobs and those who don't know his history... My condolences
It's amazing how only one person can change the way of life of millions around the world.  We'll miss Steve Jobs. Rest in peace.     
Thank you for everything you made. The World is better because of your innovation.  R.I.P. 
No other man has influenced modern technology or the modern world more  than Steve Jobs.  My condolences to his colleagues and family.
You encouraged many people all over the world.  One of my best friend passed away last year of same disease 39 years old.  I had most hard times for a few years...I admire your courage.  You made consistent efforts to make new things.  I will do my best from now on.  Pray a repose of you..never forget you... 
Steve, thank you for your Genius. You left us too early.   You definitely put a ding in the Universe!!!  God Bless.
We should all be so lucky to live a life full of passion, creativity and  impact.  Steve Jobs was an amazing example that one man can change the  world. Thank you Mr. Jobs, and thank you Apple for inviting others to share.
As I open my MacBook Air to begin work and update my status on my  iPhone, i remember the man that has changed much of America if not the  world by bringing us closer to our music, our work, and each other.  I  utilize an Apple product at least once an hour of every day that I am  awake.  The impact on my life and my patients is enormous.  As we mourn  the loss of a visionary we look to Apple to continue the innovations.   Thank you Steve Jobs. You will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
It will be very hard to find anyone like Steve Jobs. His intelligence is unmatched. His leadership is worth emulating for generations to come. He will be missed. Long Live Steve!&nbsp;
Steve was amazing. He was a revolution of the 20th and 21st century. He did everything we could have only dreamed of. Look at what he has done today. The  Mac, iPod, iPhone, and let's not forget the iPad. These were all made real by Steve.       His passing on is very sad and he will be remembered. He will be in the  history books. GOD BLESS STEVE JOBS!
I don't do this kind of thing, but when I heard Steve had passed, I was moved to share.  The world will miss his creative mind and understanding of design and function.  Having been involved in the computer world for the past 25 years, there are few "true" innovators in the high tech world.  Most focus only on function and not on style....Steve blended the two completely and made people "love" his products.  I was in the IT dept of a fortune 20 company in the mid 80s and tried to get Apple products adopted into our IBM standard world.  We went to Cupertino and caught the vision for how they were building products.  We did not get it.  It was not until Steve came back to Apple in the 90s that he was able to fulfill his vision.  I have always been a big fan and will always keep my Apple II from the 80s and remember how a few people can have a big impact on the many.  Rest in Peace Steve...job well done.&nbsp;
You changed our lives, you changed the world - what more can be said.
Few people change the world, Steve did. My sincerest condolences to his  family, friends and the world.
I was sitting at my Windows PC getting stuff ready for tomorrow when I get a pop up alert from CNN on my iPod to say Steve had passed. I can't help thinking that somewhere Steve is saying, "Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!"     Steve, people will remember you as a genius but it will be the absence of your vision that the world will miss the most.     Heaven is in for one heck of a makeover!&nbsp;
Very said day for our World. Steve indeed will be missed as he is and always will be APPLE!  REST IN PEACE GENIUS!&nbsp;
  My first touch of a personal computer was on the Apple IIe.....thank you for forever changing the way we all interact with personal technology....
Edison invented the light bulb and Steve showed us where to shine it. 
Dear Steve,  thank you for making this planet a better place. Thank you for making my life easier, more intense and more creative. I will miss you!
To all the Apple family and the immediate Jobs family my deepest sympathies.  The world has lost a marvelous human being.&nbsp;
I knew this day would come, but never so soon. A genius taken from us, for reasons that can never be justified. I hope that this day of mourning will become a day of celebration, happiness and joy. For all the amazing innovative and creative ways that he could come up with these technological, cool, artistic devices and concepts, there will be nobody to replace him for a very long time. A true genius, will be remembered forever.&nbsp;
you will be missed.  your vision and ability to reinvent the wheel has  been amazing to watch and be a part of.&nbsp;
It was Steve's spirit of innovation and creativity that drove me to pursue my ambitions with great fervor. My heart breaks to know he's gone, but on the inverse is overjoyed at the thought that he will continue to inspire even in his absence. Goodbye Steve....thank you.&nbsp;
 ...because of you the world of technology is changed for ever. You will missed and remembered forever. May your soul rest Mr Steve Jobs :'(
You will be missed by the millions that you touched. Thanks for all the really cool stuff. I feel like I lost a friend that I never met Rest in peace.
The company statement says it all! You are indeed an visionary and  creative genius that changes a bit of everybody and today's world. You  will be long remembered and remembered as great inspiration to all of  us. RIP&nbsp;
Thank you for creating something so wonderful and allowing me, and millions of other Apple fans, to experience it.  Your wisdom has been invaluable: "Sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith". That's what you once said, and it's those words that keep me pushing forward whenever I'm beginning to lack hope.  Thank you, Steve Jobs. It has been an honour and a pleasure sharing in the results of your vision.
Thanks Steve for making our world more beautiful, and lifting our dreams to the sky. You showed me and many many people that anything is possible. You fought till the end. Keep enlightening us from wherever you are
My thoughts go out to Steve's wife and children as they deal with their loss. Born in 1984, I feel lucky to be part of the generation that has had the opportunity to experience the impact that a person like Steve Jobs can make on the world.
Steve Jobs was a brilliant man. For me, I remember him as the man that allowed me to have my first REAL laptop - a MacBook Pro 2011. It allowed me to finish college and graduate with honors. Although he will be truly missed, his vision will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
"Thank you so much Steve, for everything! this world will miss you in every single minute..."  "Sadly, I had not the opportunity to meet you in this life, but wish to have the opportunity to simply shake your hand, when I go over to the other side!"  "You were an awesome dude!"  "See you Steve..."  My condolences to Steve's family and friends <br>
It truly is a sad day. I have been using Apple products now for over 10  years and have pushed the products onto friends and family, and they  couldn't be happier. I would like to pass my condolences onto Steves'   family and friends and to the crew at Apple.
the moment comes for all of us -- and it always seems too soon.  rest peacefully. we'll miss you. 
Steve Jobs was definitely one-of-a-kind man. I am very grateful for have been born in this time of scientific and technical advances, but the world would be very different if we had had only one choice to access information technology, without the elegance, innovation and customer-oriented approach of Apple. The brilliant ideas of Steve will be always in our minds. God bless Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I will always live in deep appreciation to Steve for making human life better. My deepest sympathy to his family.&nbsp;
To keep it short and sweet- working for Apple completely changed my life and  it all started with Core. I can't begin to explain how saddened I am about the loss of our innovator, our mastermind, our Keynote presenter- oh man I don't know what I'm gonna do! Apple is so much more than a "brand"- it's a family and I'm so grateful to be a part of it.
A sad loss for those left behind. May he rest in peace. 
My thoughts and prayers go to his family. He has been an inspiration to millions and he will be missed. I send my sincere condolence.&nbsp;
Just last night I watched a video of Steve giving the commencement speech at Stanford University.  As always, I was amazed at the wisdom, courage and inspiration his words could convey.  He led a truly amazing life and will be missed tremendously.  All the best kind thoughts and condolences to his family, friends and Apple employees. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs will be missed.
Dear Steve,  It's been only one and half years since I bought my first Apple device, iPhone 3GS. However, I have never believed such a small thing would influence my life with this great joy and amazement.  Rest in peace, Steve. You will be insanely missed by everyone.
The world has lost a great man and a visionary leader. Would that each  of us could leave this world having made it a better place. Steve Job  has certainly achieved that in his too short a life.
Having bought one of the first Apple II+ computers in the late 70's I can say we lost the greatest mind of my generation. Steve you made my life better and a whole lot more fun. Rest in peace and may God give your family the strength needed to continue celebrating your life.&nbsp;
A real genius, a great mind and a role model for everyone. We will miss his mind and vision. Thanks Steve for all your lifetime work that has changed the  world!&nbsp;
I never met Steve Jobs.. But I feel a big void. Like I've lost a friend. He leaves behind an amazing legacy.  
Steve,  Thank you for your passion, your vision and your devotion to the company that has brought so many wonderful innovations and products to us, the consumer.   I pray that you,  your family &amp; loved ones have peace and comfort during this time of mourning.
I would suggest that Steve has been the single greatest innovator (or driver of innovation at least) in the history of the PC by a long margin.  I hope that he has successfully transferred his vision to the Apple team and that we can expect his world-changing ideas to continue to flourish.  Thanks for your efforts Steve!&nbsp;
I never knew him, but as a software developer, I admire the way he made powerful machines with the user experience truly in mind.  My generation, the X-ers, and my children's generation, will be forever changed by his inventions.  I think he would be proud of the homepage.  Simple.  Functional.  My condolences to the Jobs' family, and his extended family, better known as Apple.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs seems to be a good example to live your life to the fullest!  He seemed to enjoy his work with great passion that seemed like it  wasn't really work to him but a passion to do what he did.  May he rest  in peace and my prayers and thoughts are with his family. &nbsp;
When I launched Safari on my MacBook Pro I could have never imagined that I would find such tragic news on Apple's Homepage. Since I discovered the wonders of Apple I couldn't help but follow Steve Jobs' news, speeches, products and appearances, and we (my husband and I) started calling him "THE MASTER", because the world has changed for good because of him, he even said his illness was natural trying to stop the fast rhythm of Jobs' evolutionary mind. My thoughts and prayers go to his family and the great company he leaves behind.
You have changed our world and forever will be remembered as the great man you are and always were. We will all miss you Steve. From me, a northern irish kid that has always looked up to you and your ground breaking inventions. Rest in peace Steve.&nbsp;
 Steve was my idol. But I can say that he's still my idol, because what he did changed the world and changed our lifestyle, it had a big impact in the late 20th and in the 21st century and left a mark in the technology, a mark that will be evident in the future technology. &nbsp;He also changed my life, he made me dream and realize that I can make my dreams come true. We'll miss him, but I think he also deserves a break due to all he did for us. &nbsp;Thank you very much for what you did Steve. RIP.
My condolences to the family and Steve's friends. Thank you Steve for making this world smarter and more fun place to be in. 
In November of 2010 I watched a youtube video of Steve Jobs giving a commitment speach at Stanford University. This, along with texts like Think Rich, Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill inspired me to take control of my situation and make changes. At the time I was 25, homeless, without a degree and scrambling to find solutions. I had recently divorced, lost my job, and everything I had trying to stay afloat. I spent below zero nights sleeping in my car. I had a brief stay at my fathers house where I read an article about this speech. After reading that and the aforementioned text I decided to write an article in the paper recounting my experience and expressing my desire for a mentor. That article lead to a career. My opportunities are now endless, as I am a salaried employee at an amazing company. I have since rented a house and no longer have to worry about where my next meal will come from. In fact, my thoughts are on innovation and how to drive my company forward. For those things, I continue to look back on Steve Jobs and his legacy for inspiration and guidance. Steve Jobs will be remembered as one of the greatest innovators and businessmen of our history. His words and thoughts will mentor many in the future. I am so lucky that he was able to share his experiences and teach in the manner he did. It was part of the equation that changed my life. I hope that he rests in peace and that his family understands the impact of his genius.
I will always remember working at Pixar and having the privilege of working with so many great people. Having the honor of working with Steve Jobs is something I will never forget. Before I herd the news my youngest daughter came home today and put on a Pixar Studios shirt that I purchased from the Pixar store when I worked there. One of my fondest memories is when Steve was having lunch with Tim Allen and I was working security and was asked to make sure no one bothered them during their lunch. He was so down to earth he asked me what I was doing and I told him and he said you don't need to spend your time looking out for us. I told him it's my pleasure just doing my job and he said thank you. He was always friendly and kind. The world has lost a great person! My families prayers goes out to his family. Life, Love, and Eternal Happiness! &nbsp; Peace be the journey!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has been an inspiration for over 30 years. Proving time and time again that quality, that doing things right, that doing things with passion, matter in this world. Apple and Steve, both Steves, at their best were, are, about developing products and services that inspire passion; that inspire awe.  My condolences to Apple for losing a truly unique and talented leader. To his family and friends for losing a loved one. My thoughts are with you in your time of loss and grief. Insanely Great.  Steve Jobs. 
The Human Being Will Remember You Forever.
Steve Job, you were a pure figure to look up to you will always be  remember to me as a figure 
I am one  of Apple fans from China, I was shocked by hearing the death of Steve, he was  a  great man that impressed  all of the world, we feel very sad now. To send my regards to his  family &amp; Apple Inc.
I now have the courage to open my own business finally in honor of his inspiration. I needed it :(  I will now "Think Different".
PARA SIEMPRE AMIGO. ERES EL MEJOR. 
I'm sure you guys have seen this, but just in case, this is the best message I have seen so far that sums up the way I feel right now, from the Star Trek facebook page, I couldn't agree more with this:&nbsp;"Thank you Steve Jobs, your impact helped us realize the 23rd century sooner than we thought possible."
Dear Steve, I'll miss you. Every time I use my iPhone, my iPad, and my MacBook Air, you' re with me. You made my life so enjoyable. Sitting at dinner w my wife, sharing photos of our shih tzu on my iPad, or looking for great places to go on vacation by surfing my iPhone at Starbucks, or facetiming w my wife and dog while away for the night. We'll miss you Steve. You made the world a much better place. But you'll always be in our hearts.&nbsp;
like millions of people around the world I never met you but I come to know of you through your wonderful work you are an angel who came to earth with a mission which you have lovingly performed and finish left behind for usnow you are gone but before you went, you left us you family so we can go on with life, yes we will but most of all we (will REMEMBER YOU MR.

 Steve Jobs. You are the great. R.I.P.&nbsp;
Hi Apple.   My name is Michael Pacifico and I am 17 years old. Mr. Jobs has been an idol of mine for a long time now and I was very disheartened when I found out that he had passed away earlier today. Mr. Jobs  has created a legacy that I will never forget and I appreciate you taking the time to put Mr. Jobs on your homepage even after the launch of a major new product. I now realize how great of a company Apple is for caring so much about the person who was a major founder of the company. Thank you so much and I know you will keep strong to Mr. Jobs's legacy.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a true inspiration and one of the greatest minds of a  generation.  While he will be missed, he will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
...Steve Jobs showed that being smart is its own reward.&nbsp;I'm a nerd. I was picked on a lot in school. I was awkward and unsure of myself despite the fact that I always knew the right answer.   Steve Jobs is one of greatest inspirations in my life because he showed me to never be ashamed of being smart, of having a better idea, of seeing through the dross.   Many people point to Presidents, Bill Gates, or even Einstein as being role models for smart kids. Steve is a much better role model because he made it "cool" and SEXY to be smart. He did it so well I wonder if anyone will ever do it better.   Regards to his friends and family.
Today I was thinking about Steve Jobs, wondering how he was doing. Sad to read the headline on cnn this evening, shocked too. Always held out hope that this brilliant man would be the one to overcome cancer. Mr. Jobs and his family, you are in my thoughts and prayers tonight. I pray that technology and medicine will someday rid our world of cancer, that we can stop this disease from taking the best.
Thank you Steve for proving that creativity, imagination and magic are as important as ever in business. Your vision, ideas and drive will be missed.
Working on Mac Pros in post production day in day out. Having a MacBook Pro and iPhone and iPod. Steve Jobs and Apple has been a massive part of my life,  in education and now work. RIP. "You could see it when we couldn't."&nbsp;
I, like most senders to this email address, did not have the opportunity to meet Steve Jobs in person. Although, that is not to say we did not know Steve. Steve Jobs lived and lives on vicariously through everything that Apple has accomplished. He has inspired and changed the lives of millions. I want to be short with this email, but ultimately I want to thank Steve Jobs for creating and believing in a vision that has been so empowering over the last few decades.
My entire family... 3 generations... (my 92 year Father loves his   Iphone, MacBoook, and Ipad) want to thank you  for all  the amazing   songs, photos, movies, and FUN we have all shared because of you and   Apple. You have really enriched our lives! 
You are a hero to me. I feel lost about your news. I will remember you forever. And I will tell my son(he is 6 years old now) that there is ever been a great person like you! Good bye, Steve.&nbsp;
Young  entrepreneur, co-found of Pixar Studios, you will be missed, you  are a true inspiration to many, if not all.
To Steve Jobs, You have been an inspiration and my role model. With a great pain and tears in my eyes, I am writing this. What you have given to the world is priceless. Generations and generations are going to remember you. I salute to your spirit, your trueness, your creativity and confidence. As I read more your articles about your speeches in Harvard and others, more I learn from it. I guess without we would not see such a fast paced computer and mobile revolution. You have created competed enough to make technologies available cheaper. Mac, iPhone, iTouch, iPad are a revolution in itself. We common man would not even dream to have such things and you made those things affordable. I have no words to convey my Thanks to your contribution for this world. I pray from bottom of my heart that may your soul rest in peace. When entire world is having hard time to see you go away, it much very difficult for your family and co-workers to go through pain. I would just like to say I am with you at this tough time.
Sad moment but he leaves behind a legacy and a spirit that will keep his spirit alive for few more decades/century. Anna (i.e. 2.5 years old and already fan of the iPad), Gaelle (i.e. mother and daily user of iphone and MY ipad) and Philippe (father trying to enjoy 5mns per day of his ipad and daily user of the iphone). RIP Steve.
"This is Not the End, The Future isn't Dead, Its Our Time to Innovate, Our turn to change the World." Thank you Steve for all you have taught us.
He is the greatest guy ever&nbsp;
Dear Mr. Steve::     your great invention let the world is full of miracles, hope your spirit, you live in my heart forever.
My condolences to Mr. Jobs family and friends.  The world has lost a  great man today, Mr. Jobs and his creation of Apple has forever changed  my life with his hard work and dedications.  He'll be greatly missed and  never forgotten.&nbsp;
As a "new" (age 68!) Apple purchaser, I am a very recent admirer of Steve Jobs and find his products to be AMAZING. I am learning through the one to one product at the ONLY Apple Store in Iowa! Genuflected on his patented glass staircase in the SF Flagship store 2 weeks ago and took free Apple I-phone lesson there. It seems he understood his customers and wanted his products to be embraceable for all types, not just for geniuses like himself. He set up a system for learning that is very affirming and welcoming.  Few humans leave a legacy like he has- he was BIG man and will leave a big hole. Deepest sympathy to those whom he loved in life.
 Mr. Jobs is inspiring, having realized his dream in only 56 years. Thats what legends are made of! His life also shows how one life can change so many. His life was a gift to us all.  May his dream continue to be realized. Blessings to his family at this time.&nbsp;
My sincere condolences for those of you close to Steve.   Though I was not fortunate enough to personally know him, I too feel that I have lost a friend. The awesome accomplishment that is Apple, is testiment to his far reaching vision.   Steve not only has helped make Apple into a Legendary Company, in the process he has become a Legend unto himself...  Thank You Steve, for everything!!!
gracias por todo lo que hicistes y por su gran aporte q distes a la  humanidad..  gracias a ti soy feliz con apple... paz en su tumba y mis condolencias mas sentidas a la familia..  cordialmente&nbsp;
Mr Steve Jobs a hero, visionary and Creative genius lives in our heart  forever.
STEVE, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. WISH YOU ARE STAYING HUNGRY STAYING  FOOLISH AT A MUCH BETTER PLACE. RIP.&nbsp;
My dad rarely sends me e-mails. One of the only e-mails I've ever gotten from him was a link to an article with the transcription of a speech that Steve Jobs gave. The speech was so well written and inspirational that even my dad, a man who struggles with English, felt the need to share it with me.  Steve Jobs, you brilliant man. You deserve to be on everyone's conversations, thoughts, statuses, tweets, tumblr posts, and many more. Thank you for convincing me to give you my money, time and time again.  And thank you for reminding us all that you do not have to sacrifice true creativity for the sake of running an effective "business".  RIP.&nbsp;
Steve helped change the world in more ways than introducing a new phone  or computer. He helped usher us into the technoligical world we live in.  Graphic design, movies, photos and music would all be the dark without  the light he provided. He was a true visionary and mentor to more people  than he would ever know. We might have bought his products but it was  the only way we could truly thank him for everything he has done.  His  name will be remembered along those such as Thomas Edison. He still  wanted to bring us the most advanced products and pushed himself while  still within his battle. Unfortunately he lost this battle and we will  continue to fight it for him.  We give our condolences and our thanks to  a Giant in the industry.
I have never felt this sad after losing someone I never actually met.    
Steven Paul Jobs, and the world will remember him forever. He is on the minds of everyone forever. Although I was just someone who has the ability to design I believe in him and he is a role model and inspiration to create my work further."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Rest In Peace. 
Dear Steve,   Apple Computer as as whole has been intergal part of my life since 1998 when I was 16.  Through college my Macbook and iPod were always in my backpack during my daily subway commute to class.    In 2008 I used my iPhone to take the first pictures of my beautiful daughter, and e-mailed them to my family across the country.  In 2011 my three year old daughter is an expert at navigating her iPad and takes it with her everyday on our drive to preschool watching Toy Story 3.  The world will soon realize the talent and visionary you were.   We thank you for all the facets of our life you touched.   Thank you Steve. 
         <meta http-equiv"content-type"="" content"text="" html;="" charsetiso-8859-1"="">           <font face"verdana"=""><br>       I would like to express "My Utmost Respect to the Legend". <br>       <br>       What a sad piece of news to received at my early Thursday morning.       Although I am expecting for the worst since he announced his       resignation, but I am still feeling the great loss. Although Steve       is not someone that I knows personally and vice versa. But       everyday, in using Apple's product, I feel like I am in constant       communication with him. Therefore, he will live on in the form of       the great products and innovations that we get to enjoy.<br>       <br>       All the best in the other world!<br>     </font>     
Steve Jobs was an inspiration to me as a young kid in the early 90's and one  of the reasons I am becoming a computer science major. There will never be another like him, he was the greatest visionary business man we have or will ever know.&nbsp;
The world lost a man who changed the world. Steve is in my heart. Thanks Steve.
...what Steve Jobs did to impact a generation!  He'll be sorely missed!!! 
Dear Steve,  You leave us in a time of great uncertainty, and yet we couldn't have asked more than the courage and life you've shared with us to Think Differently. We now must take up even just a bit of your shinning example of going forwards to shape our world into a better place.  With blessings and gratitude for all you have given us, may your journey be fulfilling.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for the legacy you leave behind.  Thank you for having the vision to change the way I work and communicate and consume content.  Thank you for your relentless pursuit of execution at the highest standards.  Thank you for the positive impact that you made on the world and for firmly restoring the America as the world's innovation leader.  You were an inspiration to a young entrepreneur.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.&nbsp;
I read about it on my Macbook, spread the word with my iPhone, and mourned with my iPod. The fact that the man behind all of these items is no longer with us is truly saddening. Steve Jobs has not only changed the world of PCs but of music, learning, and connectivity. Thank you Steve Jobs for all you have done and may you rest in peace.    
Though I'm only 17, I'm proud to have been a part of his legacy. My sincere condolences to his family and friends. 
Truly lost an inspiring man, his influence on human kind is greater than anyone can imagine. His passion and dedication even from his 10 years absence from his own company aspires us to chase our dream and never give up. He will be sorely missed and be remembered by all following generations as a man that changed the world and humanity.     We all miss you!        
 My prayers are with Steve's family and friends. Be comforted in knowing he is in a place that was the starting point of his genius. He has truly made the lives of millions better. What a legacy.
Today has passed away  not only a visionary, maybe Mr Jobs was the  Julius Verne of our time, creator, designer, enterprenour, a man that  has inspired many people like me in many contries. My deepest condolences to his family. &nbsp;
Its a sad new to know that he passes away, he was a genius. But he leave us a great spirit of effort and many beautiful tech creations. Thanks a lot. RIP.
Steve Jobs will be missed. He changed the graphic design industry. I   was trained on T-Squares and Pica poles and then everything changed.  Peace be with you Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a brilliant visionary who made all of our lives a better place. He will be sorely missed. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones during this sad time.
Thomas Edison. Henry Ford. The Wright Brothers. Steve Jobs. My children's children will read about them all and how they changed their respective world, but I had the privilege of experiencing what it was like to actually watch the world be changed around me by a true original. Gone, but never to be  forgotten.&nbsp;
 Godspeed, Steve Jobs. "We love you, Steve!"   You have changed our lives and will always be remembered.&nbsp;
Words escape me now!  Truly saddened by the news.  Steve, you are and always will be an inspiration to us all.  God bless the Job family.&nbsp;
A genius has passed away. This world would not be the same place without  him. Rest in peace. 
When I read the news, I got very sad. I will always remember Steve Jobs as one of the greatest technology innovators in history.&nbsp;
My prayers are with you all whom his life touched...RIP Mr. Jobs  
Thank you Steve for being an inspiration to all of us.  We will miss  having you with us, and will always remember you. 
To the family, associates,and everyone at Apple. I wish to share my deepest sympathy. Steve Jobs will be missed greatly.
Lamento profundamente la muerte de un grande, quiero dedicarle mi frase inédita y preferida: apoyo y exhorto a las pocas personas que luchan hasta la muerte por conquistar su ideal.&nbsp;
Good Bye Steve.  You led three tech revolutions: taking existing niche hardware devices  and turning them into must-have gadgets for the masses.  You've made my world much better.&nbsp;
   I still could not believe we lost him. There is no words other than "To our hero". We will remember you forever. Everytime we slide right our iPhone, everyday we open Macbook, and every mins when we enjoy the evolution you brought us.  Miss you forever. 
thank you for creating an awesome phone. i've been a user of an iPhone  from the first generation to iPhone 4. thank you. you may rest in  peace Steve. you will always be remembered.
I am humbled. I continue to find inspiration from the legacy of Steve Jobs and I expect the world will continue to for a very long while.  I was a boy when our family got our first Macintosh 128k. What a world of difference - and that was 128k! I have been in love with Apple ever since.  An indomitable spirit, a visionary with a heartbeat ahead of the pulse of social and creative society; the world has lost a remarkable individual. I send my sincere condolences to all who knew and all who will continue to love Mr. Jobs.  Thanks, Steve. What a fantastic journey. What a gift of a promise you leave.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You had lived on borrowed time and  lived it with more vigor and passion than those who live their life  wholly. Such an inspiration and a somewhat distant mentor. Thank you,  it's our turn now, and I hope we do not disappoint you.
Wow, truly saddened to learn of Steve's death. He will forever be remembered  as a true pioneer of technology and his legend will survive through the company.  If it wasn't for him, I'd not have found my love for Apple products.  I think of his family and friends at this sad time.&nbsp;
Without Steve Jobs I would have missed so many happy moments. He gave us these incredibly beautiful products and without them the  world wouldn't be such a nice place. Thank you really much Mr. Jobs - you inspired me and just impressed me. Rest in Peace.
Steve Jobs a true visionary: Steve Jobs was a true inspiration to all the people in the world who have a dream to change the world. We will never know how many world changers will emerge from his inspiration and the changes to the world he leaves behind. We never take into account how much of this world of technology he is responsible for. We all saw this information on some form of personal computing device that you made possible.&nbsp;Whether it&nbsp;was a Mac book, iMac, iPad, iPod, iPhone, Smart Phone, or a Personal Computer, it was Steve Jobs who paved the way for this to be possible. You will be missed by all and I hope the future of Apple continues to change the world the way you did. Rest in Peace &nbsp;&nbsp;
This is such a tremendous loss for the world. Apple changed—no, REVOLUTIONIZED the way we communicate, the way we do business, the way we work and play and live. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. And thank you for your phenomenal legacy.&nbsp;
Apple Staff and Community,   I just wanted to send my condolences to those who knew Steve on  a personal level. I never knew him on a personal level, but I know that  he was an amazing and inspirational figure to many. I am a huge Apple  fan and that wouldn't be possible without Steve's genius and original  ideas. I will always continue to by Apple products when it comes to my  electronic needs/wants because ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ELSE CAN COMPARE!   Thanks Steve for all of the blood, sweat, and tears you poured  into transforming your dreams and goals into the most marvelous,  customer satisfying company that will ever exist!
While i am not a member of your wonderful community, i wanted to take he  time to thank Steve Jobs for the works he's done amongst the people he  mattered to most. As a composer and educator, the products he oversaw, developed, improved  and believed, have been an important part of everything that I do. He will be sorely missed by a consumer of the products he oversaw, that  he never met, but that admired him for the work he did and the work that  his work, allow me to do regularly. My condolences to all of you.  But thank you for allowing his genius to  be a part of my life.
i bought my first apple product in 1983--an apple IIe-- and since then i have been a loyal apple customer.  i loved my apple cube!   i have enjoyed apple's combination of technology, design and the fact that it just works.  i am deeply saddened by steve's passing.   i am sure words cannot describe the emotions of steve's family, friends and co-workers.  he was a true genius and visionary.  he will be missed.  steve was insanely great! 
You have changed humanity for the better.  Peace and Love Steve and thanks for everything.
RIP Steve Jobs,  I will never forget my first Apple product the iPod, in some way it has contributed to my college graduation.  Steve you are an inspiration to many and I am sad that you are gone too soon.  You are leaving behind quite a legacy, you will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
Our deepest Condolences first to his family, second to his friends, and third to his Apple family and fans.  Light and Love &lt;3 You will be missed.
I am fourteen years old, live in Canada, and am currently in my first year of high school. In school, there's always that techie kid. In my school, that's me. Technology would not be where it is without Steve Jobs. Every single computer my family has ever owned was an Apple computer. I have grown up with Apple. It's become apart of my life. It was the way of the past, and is the way of the present and future. Everything we do relies on computers to some extent. Computers are how I check to see what I missed in school one day, how I research assignments, how I connect with people I know no matter what the distance between us may be, how I listen to the radio and the news, how I read newspapers, how I edit videos I make, how I edit photographs I have taken, how I learn, how I create, and how I express myself. When Steve created Apple, I'm sure he had no idea what it was going to come. But I'm sure now, he's completely pleased with the outcome. I can see what he envisioned, and I'm glad to see his dream came true. When I move on to university, I'm going to study computer science. The inspiration came from Steve Jobs. I never really knew what exactly I wanted to be when I grew up, but now I do. I think that was one of Steve's goals... To inspire the creation of what others cannot see. He certainly inspired me to do so. I'll never forget him, nor how much he impacted my life. The passing of Steve Jobs is such a sad loss for the world, but as long as Apple's here, it's almost like he never left.&nbsp;
Hope God bless him.  We will remember him, and his remarkable success. 
I will always remember Steve Jobs as a genius, a forward thinker and a mind ahead of its time. Rest in peace and thank you for transforming your world, my world, our world. &nbsp;
I was never blessed to meet Steve personally, but watching him on stage  i could feel it, his amazing presence he had that affected EVERYONE he  stood in front of. It was him doing what he loved that lit up the stage.  I really missed this presence during the last apple conference and i  know i was not alone in that feeling. But i take peace in knowing that  he was with his family. He was so young and i am praying for peace to  his wife and family in this time of need. I know apple will NEVER be the  same, but i also know that all who remain have the same love for apple  that Steve did, and therefore Steve's touch will be on every future  product we see from apple. I will miss him and am so sad at this news  today! God bless the family and close friends.
Steve will always be an inspiration to many. Being a regular guy made you even greater than any CEO of any company. We will miss you and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
My heart goes out to Steve's family and the Apple team.&nbsp; As a graphic designer for the past 36 years, I can't even begin to describe how much Apple has enhanced my life both in business and personally. I am fortunate to have lived during Steve's time and am sure he will be a great inspiration to future generations.&nbsp;
Thank You Steve for reminding us all that vision is and should always be  the driving force in making our world better. I would like to personally  thank you for bringing my family closer together by bettering our lives.  I would also like to send out my deepest heart felt condolences to your  family and friends.  Thanks again for making the world better, only a true genius could  accomplish the impossible by making the world bigger and smaller at the  same time.
I cannot think how the technology would be in future. Steve Jobs has an amazing impact in our life by founding apple. Yes, we lost an amazing and great man who made our life easier by the devices he was behind. I am sorry for the would for losing Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Give all my sorrow and respect. God is waiting for him in Heaven. 
My very first computer was an Apple, and my last will be as well.   Wish your family the best.&nbsp;
 Even though I didn't personally know Steve Jobs, there is one thing I do know -Everywhere I look on my college campus, I see Macs, iPhones, iPods, and iPads. This man changed all of our lives. We wouldn't be where we are in technology without him. For that, I thank him. Thank you for always being a step above everyone else. Thank you for introducing products that I now cannot live without. You changed the game. You left your mark on this world. Thank you, Steve Jobs.             
The world has lost a friend that practice Mindful Creativity. Condolences to the family.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Les mots manquent toujours dans ces moments lE0. Mais quel Homme Steve  Jobs. Quelle grande tristesse d'apprendre cette nouvelle ce soir.
Thanks a lot. Your intention will be passed on to our children.&nbsp;
To the Families  (personal, work, industry and the world) of Steve Jobs.  Thanks for reaching beyond the established limits and believing in the Possible. You proved that there are no limits  to the imagination. "Dreaming" is what you left as a legacy. We need more people with your courage and passion.   Thanks for being YOU. &nbsp;
Thank you for all of the wonderful years of visionary products.  You have truly shaped our futures.&nbsp;
Every so often, there are those that walk among us, but are not like us. Visionaries, geniuses, prophets... Steve was one of these. He was all of them. He changed my life, and changed the world. What he and Apple built steered the course of the last 30 years. Trends were established, catch phrases coined. Lives forever influenced.
Steve had such a tremendous influence on the entire planet. Technology  is less obnoxious, our lives are richer, and our access to information  is better organized and distributed because of Steve's vision and  passion. Somehow, my Mac and my iPhone feel just a bit less magical. Words are hard to come by. Saying 'thank you' doesn't seem sincere  enough. Steve turned those gnarly, unruly boxes of silicone and  phosphors into devices which ordinary human beings could use. He made  technology "just work." He was my hero, and his passing takes my breath away. We do not yet know  how his absence will truly be felt. Rest in peace, Steve.
I am an Information Technology teacher in New York. I will be dedicating tomorrow to remember Steve for what he has done in the field of technology for the world. We will be remembering him for his innovations and greatness. 
 i got really shock when i hear this, this man was my inspiration in many ways.  i dont really know what to write im 15 years old and from mexico but i give my condolences to the family and i want to let them know this man is my idol thank you for your attention. R.I.P  long live steve jobs.&nbsp;
hello steve jobs was my great mentor, would like to create things and leave as his legacy alive with all, a salute to Apple, a farewell to Steve Jobs&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for changing the world. Not only on the devices you invented but also the good customer service Apple does. You truly a mentor to anyone.  R.I.P Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
When our younger generation think of Steve Jobs, they might only remember the current successes for his line iPhones, iPads, and iPods. However I cannot help but be in awe of his humble beginnings, respect his visions, and admire his propensity to start a company at such a young age. Growing up in NYC and seeing the colorful apple logo everyday on the way to school, I had the opportunity to grow up and be impacted by his beautiful mind.    To his family, his "Apple" family, and friends, I pray that you find refuge in Steve Jobs' force as a pioneer in the technological revolution, our information age. As a human being, may you have fond memories that live on in the legacy of his children, family, and close friends.    Godspeed to you in your time of loss and reflection.&nbsp;
My condolences, the world has lost a man who truly knows and cares about user's experience and requirements. Ever since I have switched to using MAC OS, I have never looked back. It is the most magnificent piece of art, it renewed my impression of computing, seamless and smooth.&nbsp;
Thank you, Mr Jobs, for all of the amazing things that you've given to us. You will be sorely missed. My thoughts and condolences to those you left behind.&nbsp;
We will miss you Steve!!! You made a positive difference in the world.
I own no more than a iPhone 3 and an old iPod, but the greatness I see in the products and the revolution it had made in the industry is really astonishing.  Death of Steve Jobs has created a great vacuum and is very difficult to fill. My deepest condolences for his family, for his friends in Apple and millions other like me.
His work became the archetype for what is possible when one refuses to settle for good enough and his death is proof that any man's true legacy is the sum of the experiences that they create for others. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. 
Back in 1985, when I was in the 6th grade, we had classes to introduce to the idea of using computers. We were taught Basic on Apple 2es. We all thought  that we were so cool. We made newspapers using computer images. I laugh at the idea now. But really, I am more amazed at what he achieved and how he changed the way in which we fundamentally view the world around us. The world will miss you, Steve.
As an artist, designer, art teacher, and utilizer of the creative process I have since the  beginning of this thing called 'Apple' been hooked. There has been no other way. And  there will be no other way. Let us honor Steve Jobs and keep it that way. My condolences to the Jobs Family.
apple product is what the whole world can't do without. you are part of those that makes the world what it is today technologically. thanks for sharing your wonderful life with us. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs, the world will miss you 
 Steve was amazing! The world would be where it is today if it wasn't for him. Rest in Peace.
 Steve was a great genius and I no that he is happy about iPhone 4S is coming  out and his legacy will LIVE ON :"( 
My barely 13-month old daughter started swiping our tv in the first signs that her interactions were being learned from watching her daddy and me use our iPhones.  At once startling, possibly disconcerting, but mostly surprisingly insightful that the technologies brought about from Steve Jobs' inspiration not only are changing the world, but in such a way they're bringing technical usability standards back to base human function and need. How groundbreaking are things so simple a one year old understands and can use. Our hearts ache for Mr. Jobs' family and coworkers. We can only imagine the loss of energy his absence must amount to for those closest to him, given how  far removed we are from him, but how integral in our lives his creations are.
Condolences to Mr Jobs family, friends, and co-workers.  A short life that will last forever. Stay hungry.  Stay foolish.&nbsp;
Tears stream down my face as I quietly thank the person who made it possible for me to go from an average student to a doctoral student. you saved me more than you know.&nbsp;
Steve &amp; Family, Thank you so much for how you have made my life better.  Thank you for inspiring me to seek for perfection, and really find out what a customer needs. My father has been battling pancreatic cancer, so your trials have been very familiar to me.  My heart aches for all those close to you. Your legacy will not be forgotten in my lifetime. You are in my prayers.
Dear Steave, you &amp; your team have been changed  my sense of values, the windows to the  world and my life. Anytime your way of life  encourage me. Your soul is eternal. Thank you very much from the bottom of my heart.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve Jobs. You changed my life.
 Dear Apple,   I heard about news of Steve Jobs this morning (I live in Australia so it took me a while to know). I believe he has been a inspiration to us all, both battling Cancer and becoming the CEO of the world biggest Franchise. I was barely an apple fan before the iPhone 3G came out, I barely new what is is! But now, i virtually got everything. Without Jobs, i wouldn't be able to write this email, I wouldn't of won my class compeition without iPhoto and I couldn't of helped my friend down the road with his school project. Thank You, Jobs for being a inspiration to us all. A person we will cherish forever.,&nbsp;
The world has truly lost a great man, a creative thinker; a man who has changed all of our lives.  I didn't know Mr. Jobs personally, knew nothing about his personal life. I just followed his career as he appeared in the media like most anyone else.  I could probably never hope to be as influential as Mr. Jobs was.  I'm no one, really. just another Apple user. However, Mr. Jobs' death comes at a time when I'm trying to figure out what life holds for me.  I just moved to a new city, recently graduated with a Master's degree - the world should be my oyster, so to speak.  But it wasn't until about an hour ago, when I learned that Mr. Jobs had died, that that actually meant something.  We all have some untapped potential, and Mr. Jobs was living proof that if cultivated, some of us have the propensity to create something great and unfathomable to most.  The life of Steve Jobs will  be celebrated for years and years to come.  May he rest in peace. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs is one of the few who brought progress to humanity. He has set the standard for design, engineering and innovation for years  to come.Thanks for laying out the foundation of the future.&nbsp;
I produced and directed several concert films for Paul McCartney from 2002 to recently.  While on tour in 2006, he made stop in San Jose for a show. Steve came by to see the show and say hello. It was not the first time. I was privy to their meeting being the documentarian/film maker. It was incredible particularly since is was well before Apple and The Beatles reached an agreement for the Beatles to be made available on ITUNES and both Steve and The Beatles were in legal battle. However, this did not inhibit either man from voicing their mutual care and respect for each other. They both walked away smiling from their little get together before the show that evening. In the concert movie, "The Space Within Us", I interviewed Steve for the film that night. There were a lot of other movers and shakers in that film including Bill Clinton, NASA Astronauts, Cameron Crowe, Tony Bennett and others, yet Steve's words were  the most poetic and visual. He drew an analogy of  Paul's show being what it must have been like to gather on a village green to listen to Beethoven or Mozart in their day.  Steve's presence in my film was one of my most significant achievements of my career. A moment I have often spoken of, and a moment I will never forget. It was my brush with genius two fold.&nbsp;
Steve, You were the best. You were a genius. You created the first personal in home computer. Then in 2007, you brought the IPhone which changed the world smart phones for ever. You were indeed the Albert Einstein of our time. Also you were the best business man. My condolences go out to your wife and family. We all feel sadden by the loss of the a legend. Thank You for what you've done REST IN PEACE.
Thanks Steve, I am inspired by you.  You are my role model God bless you.
While watching the keynote last night all I wanted was to see Steve on stage. He inspired me. His measure of quality and his appreciation and fascination with the idea of greatness inspired me. I wish I could see him one more time, say goodbye, and thank him for all his work.&nbsp;
I was never a fan of Apple products, they was just another personal electronic among my plethora of music players, mobile phones, personal computers and home servers. But as I sit in my home office and write this, I realized that without Steve Jobs and Apple Computers Inc. I wouldn't have all these devices in my life. Thank you Steve Jobs, you have been an inspiration to me. Without you, I wouldn't have a personal computer, without you I wouldn't have dedicated my life to computers and electronic entertainment. Rest in Peace, may the angels in the heavens treat you kindly.
Steve: a genius like you, never die. Thank you for making our world a  better place .&nbsp;
No one has had such a huge impact on getting the World together as Steve Jobs.  I did not know you but I miss you already.  Peace be with you and your family.
 My heart is broken for Mr. Jobs and his family.  He had a great impact on the world and was a very special individual.  I will never own another computer or phone that is not Apple thanks to Steve.  RIP Mr. Jobs.            
*Dear Mr. Steve Jobs, * * * *I just wanted to say thank you for creating the future for us. I don't know why it was you that had to be taken away, but loss happens to those who least expect it. Well, that's what i've figured out in life. I am only 12 years old, and I wanted to thank your parents for birthing you and for everyone in your life who helped you, help us with the next generation. I have never met you, but i have gone trick or treating at your house, and i was crying when i found out. That is how much you have affected this world. I thought you might like to know that. My family lives by apple, so i wanted to thank you for that as well. I wish my condolences to your family, because i have gone through a loss before, and am now recovering from it, so i give you all the love that they need to pull through. We will never move on, but we will move forward. Thank you for your life Mr. Jobs. You will be greatly missed, and you are very loved. 
 He was an excellent human being and a creative genius. He will continue to inspire us even if he is passed away. I am deeply saddened with his death and offer his parents and friends my deepest condolences. May he rest in peace eternally.&nbsp;
Steve didn't just change music, computers, cell phones, or technology as a whole, he changed the world. Thanks.
I just wanted to pass on my condolences to the Jobs family, and to the Apple family as well. I remember my first experiences with the Apple IIe and IIgs in elementary school - Apple got me interested in computing.  I was saddened when my school district went the PC route, but became a full convert upon taking a teaching position at a school that went against the norm and staked a claim as "The Apple school" in our district. I have truly enjoyed following the revolution Apple has brought on, and I will continue to be a supporter of all Steve and Apple have in store for the future. I never met Steve personally, but I will miss him nonetheless! Thank you for bringing this company and its wonderful products to the world.
Star bright, star light, a giant star dimmed slightly tonight then shown wit h even more brilliance.You and I are most lucky to have seen it all.Our great, great grandchildren's grandchildren will talk of this night in hushed voices. Who knows the wonders of the world they will live in thanks to t he efforts of one single human being and the wondrous team of dreamers he he lped set on a journey that will last forever.
Apple, I express my deepest condolences to you for the unfortunate loss of former Apple CEO Steve Jobs. I remember just the other day thinking about how I had an iPhone and that if it wasn't for Apple, it seems like the basis of so many products like MP3 and revolutionary touch screen phones would not exist in this day and time. I hope Apple and Steve Jobs both remember that there are so many people that love you and send our best wishes toward Apple and growing. I hope Steve's family can be mourned with the thoughts of warming others surrounding them. I'm only 16 years old, but I hope the company of Apple prosper farther into many generations. Rest in peace Steve, you're a legend.&nbsp;
 All I have to say is thanks for everything, Steve Jobs. All the world will surely miss you. You will always be remembered for your revolutionary work. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
We are heartbroken to hear this news, and simply wanted to express our  deepest condolences.&nbsp;
Hi, Just wanted to say thanks for changing our lives and for inspiring the  World.&nbsp;
Steve, We will remember.  After my 33 years in computer science, your legacy will live on through my students, colleagues, and anyone who will listen.   There is the "Apple Way" -- everything else is a distant second.  You set the bar high, and though many will try, none will reach such heights again.   Rest in peace. 
Steve Jobs was the best, and will always be one of the best. His death is a great loss to the world, but his legacy will remain forever. Deepest condolences, and rest in peace Mr. Jobs. 
What a sad sad day indeed.  We've lost a true visionary who's made a  massive impact on my life and been a seriously huge inspiration to me  and the world. Steve is the one man in life that I've truly looked up to, I've  respected everything he's done and stood for.  He is going to be sorely  missed! Apple is the only company I have an absolute passion and respect for,  Steve did this, no other CEO could garner the love that Steve has.  His  vision has made Apple products truly special and market leaders, and  once you go Apple you can't go back! Rest in peace Steve, I'll be  ordering an iPhone 4S in respect, oh ok and a new Macbook Pro too.
To Apple and Steve's closest relatives and friends, Steve was a one of a kind. His ideas and inventions are things that will live on in this world for the rest of our generation and maybe even forever. The best quality about Steve wasn't that he wanted to make money for himself, he always wanted to make the world a better place through technology, and that is exactly what he accomplished. A man that made his mark in all the right ways, helping others rather than just worrying about himself. He waited as long as he could before he resigned from Apple to make sure that the last of his ideas were able to get out there before it was too late. The world should send Steve a huge thank you for all that he has done for us. He will always be remembered as the creator of the devices of the post-PC era.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for your creative genius.  You have made my life so  much more interesting!&nbsp;
Such a brilliant mind and amazing man gone too soon.  My sympathies to your family.
With all due respect, I would like to open with one of Mr. Job's famous quotations: "Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits, the ones who think differently. While some may see crazy, we see genius." -- Steve Jobs God Bless, and thank you for your contribution Mr. Jobs…. We are all forever empowered and grateful.I am forever touched and will carry the lesson learned only to propagate….
Thank you dear Lord for giving us Steve. we will miss him.  
Best innovator known to present world.  I love the products he has created.  I'm sure he was a wonderful husband, father and friend to all.  I'm so sorry.
So sorry to hear of the loss of Steve Jobs.  May Gods peace fill the hearts of those who loved him.  My prayers are with the family and friends he left behind.  God bless.&nbsp;
  I think that this world is twice as better after Steve Jobs were  here. I'm deeply moved by his recent passing away, and very thankful  for all the great things he brought into life while he was here. I will  work every day to make this world a better place, and know that reaching  at least a fraction of what he made for all humanity, would mean  something very transcendental. Rest in peace Steve.
    My sincerest condolences to Steve's family and Company Family.  You and he transformed the world of technology and because of your innovation, brought the world to everyman.   Carry on.
Thanks for Jobs's amazing work, he has totally changed the world. History will never forget him. Have a nice time in heaven. 
I’m only 15 years old and Steve Jobs had a huge impact on me, i want to follow his steps and i wanted to get to meet him in person.... My idol, my favorite guy in the technology business... Everything he has created made me admire him for his personality and his thinking! He changed my world and i love him for that! The most devastating day in my life yet! Jobs has done my life so easy i truly appreciate him and my life in goal was to meet him! To see him in person and maybe shake his hand! I've been crying since i heard the news! He made me change the way i think, after reading his biography 20 times a day i notice he wouldn’t give up, and because of that he created the awesome thing we use in a daily base! Named them with some unique names that made me want to repeat it over and over again. iPod, iPad, iMac! I worked and worked to accomplish my great short-term goal, buy a MacBook Pro and so i did, no matter what i will keep it and in the future look at and remember my idle! "The Greatest Laptop during that time, and i am going to be proud of it because i bought it before he passed away." I’m still not processing the information that he wont be giving us any more keynotes. That he will not be publicly seen again. That he is not going to be able to say a last good bye in a public form! Steve Jobs you my idol where ever you are, i, one day will be in your place making you proud and following you steps. I LOVE YOU so much for making my life EXCITING, TECHNOLOGIC, and most of all for showing me not to ever give up! I promise to buy any product of your company and i will always be proud of them! In LOVING Memory of Steve Jobs and my condolence for the family. You had such a great visionary dad and/or husband! Love to all hugs and Kisses! HUGE APPLE FAN                                      HUGE STEVE JOBS ADMIRER!                                    "R.I.P STEVE &amp; LOVE YOU STEVE JOBS"
My husband has worked for Apple for 15 years, and Next before that.  I feel like Steve is part of our family, although their paths have only crossed a couple of times.  He's been such an inspiration - especially since we have also had struggles with cancer.    I have a quote from his Stanford commencement speech in my office above my desk, "Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.  And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition - they somehow already know what you truly want to become.  Everything else is secondary."    The world - especially the US - so very much needs to hear those words right now.  We need brave leaders.  Leaders brave enough to think for themselves, forge their own path, and lead people towards a vision.  We will certainly miss this one.  We send our love and truly heartfelt sympathy to family and close friends. Be strong and keep his spirit alive. 
What a sad day…  I only discovered Apple and its wonders last year…how privileged I am.  The world has lost the visionary behind computer and technological genius and future generations will be in awe of him like famous explorers such as Christopher Columbus and brilliant minds like Einstein.  This is a day as tragic as the loss of Princess Diana …i remember where I was then and will remember where I am today forever.  Apple will always be my favourite fruit!  RIP and condolences to his family and friends. Prayers and thoughts of the world are with you.
Steve Jobs RIP and thanks for the great technology you gave the world.
My deepest condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs. On behalf of all the dreamers, the innovators, and the visionaries I would like to thank Steve Jobs for all he has done; he has altered the world in so many ways, his impact will be everlasting. Steve was truly a remarkable man, his ideas have impacted the world; and we will forever feel the effects of all his products and technologies. RIP Steve, you have inspired so many people.  An inspired soul.
Sad, sad news, Steve Jobs was one of life's great innovators and thinkers; truly a man of our times. He will be greatly missed by those of us, by which I mean all of us who have been touched by his vision and genius.  Rest in Peace Dude. 
It may sound corny, but Steve Jobs made me proud to be an American. I mean the iPod, iPhone, iTunes, iPad.....are you kidding me! The world will never be the same. So how can I not be proud that that kind of creativity and ingenuity is all American Born. You will be missed.
World has lost a great human being. Song ended, but the melody will go on for ever. He was surely my hero.&nbsp;
I respect Steve Jobs so much for what he has done... I didn't think my life   would be so affected by a guy I have never met before.   
Thank you for your philanthropy. Thank you for your brilliant innovations. You changed my life as well as others. My prayers will be with your family th at you left behind. You will be missed!  Sent from my awesome iPad 2! 
Some people are put on this earth to change the world and make a difference. Steve Jobs was one of these people, and his life, whilst short lived was a portrait of passion, unfailing determination and accomplishments the average man or woman wouldn't achieve in a lifetime spanning into a gallery of old age.  May the people he has left behind remember his legacy and inspiration for the generations to come...&nbsp;
We will miss a great man with vision like no other. 
I just want to send my warmest thoughts and regards to Steve's family and friends. I have been a devoted Apple consumer for 12 years and I really can't imagine  anyone else doing what he has done in such a short period. I love Apple products, they inspire me everyday andy life would certainly not be the same without them. Thank you for everything Steve.
Please accept my heartfelt condolences on the passing of Steve Jobs.  He  was a true visionary and he will be missed.
We were  deeply saddened by the news about the death of Steve Job . we are so very sorry. This must be very difficult for all.    Steve Jobs  in our thoughts and our prayers.   We will miss you. 
Dear Steve, Thanks for everything, you've completely changed how we communicate and provided us with a variety of entertainment. You will be deeply missed. I also want to send my condolences to the family, who has lost a close loved one and one of the most coolest intellectual beings, us and the computer world has ever seen.  
Mr. Jobs,  I would like to thank you for, indirectly, changing the way I used to act as I professional. Not only for being a user of almost all Apple's products, but for bringing to me the "keep it simple" way of life. I wish you peace in heaven near our Lord. And once again, thank you for everything you have done. I appreciate it a lot.&nbsp;
"One person can make a difference and everyone should try" -JFK  What a difference Steve Jobs has made in the life of millions of people around the world!    Thank you Mr. Jobs for your commitment to creativity and excellence. You legacy will live on.   
To whoever gets this,  We lost an inspiration of a generation and I feel one of the deepest  pains I ever had. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. <br>
I am so sorry to the family, friends, and colleagues of Steve Jobs. The world lost one of its brightest stars today. Just wanted to share my FaceBook post from this evening...  I heard about Steve Jobs' death in a text msg on my iPhone, while getting in my car to drive home listening to my iPod... read about his death on my iPad (which I am currently typing on) and am about to go finish writing a lecture on my MacBook. Talk about leaving a legacy. RIP, Steve Jobs.
it's with a deep sadness that i heard the tragic news Please accept my condolences. and i  Write to share your great loss of the Steve’s brilliance, passion and energy that enrich and improve all of our lives. because of Steve. With deepest sorrow and sympathy. Our thoughts and best wishes are with you. <br>
Steve Jobs was a Titan of Industry, walking down the same halls as Carnegie and Rockefeller. 
Rest in peace! The technology world is nothing without you! 
R.I.P. Steve,  your creativity and what you have done already changed the whole world, you broke all the normal rules and gave us a total new path of life, your contribution is lasting forever!!!  Salute! 
He shocked the world and he changed it for the better.  Mr. Jobs was an inspiration and a guiding light.  To say that he was a visionary is like saying an iPhone can make phone calls.  The man was the most forward thinking technologist the world has known, and probably will ever know.  His legacy is profound; his genius remarkable; his truncated life tragic.  Thank you Mr. Jobs.  I wish it didn't have to end so soon.
Blessed to have lived in YOUR era, Steve. Thanks.... your work changed the world into a better place.  :) 
The world lost a real genius. Rest in peace...&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for taking us to places we could have never been, doing things we could have never done, and making humanity more beautiful.  Your influence on this world has taken mankind into the next chapter. A part of you is everywhere.&nbsp;
Some people have football players, baseball players, pro athletes of some sort as their hero. Steve, you have been my hero for a long time. This is a sad day for all of us. Thanks for making a difference Steve.  May God Bless you and your family.
I just wanted to say that I greatly looked forward to working along side Steve one day. It was my goal. I wanted to become the Senior Vice President of iOS Software (nothing against Scott Forstall, I look forward to working with him too) to have the privilege of reporting directly to him. I am certainly saddened by his death, but his inspiration will live on. If he were to reply to this email, he would say "Well don't stand still, keep moving forward." He would not want Apple or my dream to end because of his absence. Therefore, I shall keep moving forward, and I still look forward to becoming a part of the company that changed the world.<div><br></div>
God bless you, Steve! You'll always be around us.&nbsp;
Today the world has lost a pioneer of the technology industry. He will  be missed. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. 
The World has lost an incredible, innovative human being, a   contemporary Da Vinci, or Edison. I have been an Apple user since 1986   when my father brought home our first Mac. My condolences to Mr. Jobs'   family and to all the wonderful folks at Apple.
Steve made such a huge impact in my life in the past, the present, and still will in the future with your products and services.  I want to send my condolences to both his families: his personal family and the Apple family.
Our sincere condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.
 As I sit here writing this on my Macbook, I remember earlier in the day looking at it. A small white, unassuming square on the floor. But really a portal to many worlds, both creative and practical. There is so much we can do with the technology Steve helped create. We should always remember what is possible with what he left behind. Lets be like Steve and leave behind a world that is better than when we first entered it.  Thank you, Steve!&nbsp;
I have never been a big tech guy. I don't play video games and I'm no artist . But Steve jobs creations have changed the way I do things. I enjoy my appl e technology. I play games on my apple devices. I listen to music and take pics with my iPhone. It's too easy! Pleasure to have lived to see him and his  accomplishments. Thank you for everything.
You have had the best idea in history and you created amazing products. &nbsp;You're the best!!! 
I would just like to say that Steve Jobs changed the world, and always  for the better. His leadership and guidance helped create some of the  most influential technology in the world. His legacy will always live on  in the Apple brand, and every time I open my MacBook Pro from now on,  I'll think of the man that changed the world.      My condolences
"The greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it"  - William James  You have changed the world as we know it. Changed the way we approach technology blending power, simplicity and beauty.
He has revolutionized the way we do things all around the world and I  give my best of wishes to his friends and family.  
You helped me become who I am today.  You will be missed. 
Steve, I've been a Apple user from the beginning when first came out. We love you and rest in peace. Every time I use my Apple products you're with me and never will be forgotten. I will see you one day.  God Bless you and your family.&nbsp;
I built my entire career as a graphic designer on Apple products, starting with the Macintosh SE the latest iMac, with several Macs in between. I am saddened by his passing. I am also optimistic by the legacy he left. Don't let us down. Don't let us resort to PCs.&nbsp;
I think one of the most amazing things that came out of Steve's work was the way he made things more accessible. Whether it was communication, or music, or being creative, he gave people incredible tools (that they love to use) and the power to create something special, or even just make their lives a little bit better and a little bit easier. He has, in fact, changed the world.  Many at Apple have made this possible. So thank you to all of you and thank you, Steve Jobs.  I'll never forget his drive to go out in the world and do what mattered to him. This was a true force.&nbsp;
As I watched the Apple Special Event Keynote last night I wondered   about Steve, and how he felt watching you guys as you handled his   babies the way he would himself...  and then I wondered what he would do next, now that he felt his baby   was safe in your hands.  And here it is. A very sad moment but a vote of confidence and peace   for Steve.&nbsp;
You have brought so many good things to this world that made miracles happen for many people.  You will be missed but most importantly, you will always be remembered..&nbsp;
I have never met Steve but I would have loved to.  His products changed my life and made me become interested in computers.  He did what he loved to do until the end of his life and I find that to be amazing.  He is my mentor a person who I admire and strive to be.  I will miss Steve and I am so sorry that he is gone.&nbsp;
Dear Family of Steve Jobs and Apple employees,  You have my deepest sympathy in the lost of your comrade Mr. Steve Jobs. I have never met him nor seen him in person but he changed the world.&nbsp; I can recall when MacIntosh computers first came to the market along with Commodore 64's. I was in shock and wondered who made this and whoever made this computer ranks up there with Alexander Graham Bell or Thomas Edison. It is amazing how he created the IPad, IPhone, and MacBook (I don't own one yet, saving my pennies). Back in college which was years ago doing graphics, Mac's were the best when it came to graphics and storage. I am sad for your lost but I am also happy at the same time because I know that Mr. Jobs would want you great people at Apple to work harder on creating great products that make people like me wonder and wish that I could be a part of this history.&nbsp; God bless you.&nbsp;
My thoughts and prayers are with you in your recent loss.  Thank you Mr. Jobs for all of your inspiration as well as leadership,  and to his family for being there with him and allowing us to share a small part of your lives and inspiration. No words or thoughts can express the magnitude of the lives that you all have touched.&nbsp;
One of my role models. I always lived to think, I wanna live to be like  this guy one day creating tomorrows technology. Steve made some very big  changes in this world. He's in a better place now. :) I just wish he  stuck around a little bit longer. Steve will always be my model and true  a visionary to technology enthusiasts around the world. RIP Mr. Jobs. 
I am so deeply saddened by Steve's death...   His death comes at a time when the world deeply needs innovation, technical   leadership, warmth, and...a human touch, that only Steve Jobs could bring  to a  company, it's followers and the world.   No one person has accomplished so much in a single lifetime, so many   accomplishments that have become our everyday tools...  tools that no one  calls  computers...they are, simply, tools...you pick them up, use them.   Tools that connect friends, family's, from a local call or video   connections, to a call a world away on your IPad.   These were Steve's inventions, Steve's visions...visions that allow all of   us to share, even when a world apart.   God speed Steve, to your next destination.   The World will  never forget  you.&nbsp;
As you say he was a visionary, someone who gave us a way to go, a view to live. Not only concerning technology but always with the person in mind. Always pushing the limits of technology, always with the users / human beings in mind. So that Technology SERVES US Always and not the way around.... Dear Steve, you will de remenbered always, in our hearts, souls....  Thanks Steve for All that You Have Given Us.
My condolences go out to the visionary genius, Steve Jobs. It was  because of Steve Jobs that I became the biggest Apple Fan Boy, buying  everything Apple had brought out since my first purchase of the  PowerBook G4 to the iPad 2. Thank you for giving everyone around the  world these amazing gifts that you have made for us. RIP. 
My condolences to the family of Steve Jobs. He was a brilliant man that changed our world. I am sad and hurt to hear this news. I can't even imagine the  pain the family is feeling.  Here's to the memory of Steve Jobs. You will be missed.
I didn't know him personally but I will pray for his family. He was a very smart man who impacted the entire worlds way of thinking through his vision which he made possible through technology. Leaves a great legacy. God Bless. 
 So very sorry to hear he's gone. A very important man who revolutionized  the digital world.  Our  deepest condolences to his family.  He will be  missed but he is in a better place, and in peace. RIP Steve we love  You!!! 
Steve Jobs was a great person and it's a huge loss for all of us... He changed the concept of technology and with charisma won the affection  of many users of Apple products and others that know him by best C.E.O EVER! R.I.P Steve Jobs We're going to miss you! 
I'm so sad to hear this.  God Bless you all as you mourn his departure  to eternal life.  We truly are so fortunate to have the technology that  he created!  I love my mac and iPad!!  Take care all of you! 
I just got a VM from my father telling me that Steve Jobs passed away.  Although knowing his health issues, I shouldn't have been surprised. It  has left me with a great sense of loss. I know that during my lifetime  he will be remembered as the greatest visionary of my time. As a  youngster my mother would take me to the mall and leave me to wander  while she did the grocery shopping. While she shopped I would spend my  time at the local computer store in the mall that sold Apple computers.  I would play around with the painting and drawing programs. It was just  so much fun. And then one Christmas my parents bought me an Apple IIc.  Once again I would play and design things. Now 3 decades later I work as  an art director in advertising. I have owned every Apple product  possible and enjoyed every moment with them. Without them I don't think  I would have developed the love and passion I have for design. And I  would never have gone into the career I love so much. For that I thank  you Steve Jobs. You will be greatly missed and will never replaced.
I just wanted to share a quick note.   Apple changed the world...and much of that was because of Steve Jobs. I've never owned anything other than an Apple computer and that will never change.  Steve Jobs was an inspiration and incredible leader.   He changed my life with his visions and I know I'm not alone in that sentiment. Tonight I will use my iPhone and my iPad ... and my MacBook Pro and be extremely happy with my choice in technology. Cheers to Steve Jobs.  He was an extraordinary man.   
He'll be the best forever!!!!!!!&nbsp;
 My condolences to Steve Jobs family, He's a genius who left us too soon. RIP STEVE JOBS!            
Dear Steve,     I am really sorry and sad to lose you. You made a great progress in human history. You were not just a great entrepreneur but also an extraordinary visionary to make different.     Although you left us, you will not be alone there since we will be together with you together with your historic legacy.     May sleep and rest in peace forever!!!&nbsp;
  Dear steve:  Thanks for giving us so much fun, so much technology things.&nbsp;
Steve,  You will be missed, you've inspired the whole world with your innovations and creativity.  Miss you Steve.
Never felt so sad, how could this be? You are always alive in my heart.&nbsp;
Give sorrow words; the grief that does not speak Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.  ~ William Shakespeare, in Macbeth, Act IV, Scene III
My deepest condolences go out to your family and friends. U will be missed
Steve,  I consider your loss as a terrible news for the human being. You are a model for many entrepreneurs, I belong to them.  I hope you don't suffer anymore where you are now.  Thank you for having invented a part of our world.
From my first computer, Apple IIE, to my first experience with the  brilliant simplicity of the Newton(s) and the multiple iMac's and other  Mac's since, I have truly admired and benefitted by Steve's originality  and genius.  We are all better people for his contribution to society.   He set the bar for all of us to follow.&nbsp;
For family Jobs:  I feel like I lost a friend. My sincere feeling.
  My family &amp; I are deeply saddened with the loss of such a genuine, unique  pioneer like Mr. Jobs. He will truly be missed, but never forgotten. His  legacy will stand the test of time.
Steve Jobs lived the exact life he wanted to live and leaved behind the legacy he could only dream of. I heard news on a friends iPhone, saw the news report on my iPad and am sending this message from my Macbook. RIP Steve Jobs, you're in a better place and I'm sure you will bring new innovations along there with you.  My sincerest condolences
I was never a techy, but I've always loved Apple gadgets. With my iPhone and  iPad I never felt like I would press the wrong "button." Thank you, Steve!
From the Uruguay people, My condolences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs. We lost a dear friend and an inspiring mentor. Steve leaves behind a company that only he could have built, and their spirit and intelligence and always is the essence of Apple ... Thanks friend and rest in peace ...
          Today the radio announcer quoted something that Steve had written about life:   Steve wrote something to the effect that what he created didn't change the world that much, that life is short and how having children changed his perspective.  The announcer just didn't get it because she went on to say how much he really did change things as if his quote was about being modest.  Steve's thoughts went much deeper than she could comprehend.           It is apparent from his quote that his love for family ran deeper than all the vision he had.  And that life isn't about vision and all the great inventions.life is still short and relationships are still basically the same.          After hearing his quote, I felt reassured that his faith in God had probably grown as well because he had such a grip of what was truly important in this life.          May his family be comforted.  May God give them a peace that the world cannot understand and hope that they will be reunited with him again one day. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.  My first product of Apple is a iPod 5th generation 30GB Video model, the product changed my music life and I was very impressed from your  product.  Now, I am a user of MacBook Air Late 2010 model and iPod touch 4th  generation. I have felt my life is so happy because of you. I miss you...    
Steve Jobs will never know how much he impacted the world and specifically my life. My first computer was a Mac back in 1989. I crashed, tinkered with, reinstalled that mac into the wee hours more times than I can count. Little did I know at that time it would influence me so deeply and set me on path to what I am today. I am an IT consultant and am fortunate to have my own business and love what I do.  In a nutshell you could say I owe a great deal to him in shaping the person I am today. May you Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. You were one in a million and influenced, impacted and changed the world in more ways than you know. You will truly be missed but never forgotten.
 I remember one time when I was a teenager, that I tried so desperately to find Steve's personal email address - just so I could tell him how much of an idol he is to me. Another good memory of Steve was when I was in High School. The English class I was in required us to contact our favorite companies. I wrote to Apple. I can't begin to describe how much I will miss Steve Jobs.
Steve,   We never met and never will, but that does not change the fact that today was a hard day. You have been (and will continue to be) a huge role model for me and many others. As you said in your convocation speech:  Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.  Thank you, Steve. &nbsp;
steve jobs is the best and will be miss god bless  
I'm 45 tomorrow and when I heard about Steve's death today, it brought back memories of the computer club in high school in the early 80's and my first computer, an apple IIe. I will always be grateful to Steve and Woz for inspiring young people like myself to think different.  Having children myself, it hurts me even more to think of his family without him, so I send my heartfelt wishes to his wife and children. He was taken too early.
I would like to express my deepest condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and friends during this difficult time. As a Mac, iPhone and iPad user, I most certainly see, on a daily basis, the impact he had on this world. His legacy will live on in the hearts of his family, friends, and apple fans worldwide.  While I didn't know Mr. Jobs personally, I was absolutely inspired by him. Who wouldn't be inspired by a man who brought his dreams to life?  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
I wish nothing but the best for the Jobs family and friends.
Really I feel sad, May your soul rest in peace
I'm devastated by this unexpected death. A legend to stay for many  generation, an example of a visionary mind. He not only innovated  beautiful machines, but also the world lifestyle. Steve Jobs, not only a man. A real truly beautiful mind. My condolences.
Not sure who this message might reach, but first and foremost, my  condolences go out to Steve's friends and family that he has left  behind.  I know how hard it is to deal with the loss of someone so  close, but to lose someone like Steve who was in the spotlight must be  even more difficult.  For me, Steve was an inspriation for all dreamers  - those of us who wanted to make life just a little bit better for  everyone else.  Whether it be some new gadget or something less  technological in nature - Steve would have been all for it.  I know  Apple as a company will move on but Steve's legacy of innovation will be  sorely missed. I wish there was something that I could say or do to help those  suffering over the loss of their loved one, but I know there's nothing  anyone can say or do.  My heart goes out to you just the same and may  the legacy of Steve shine bright for the foreseeable future.
Sincere condolences to Steve's family.   The one who brought such happiness to millions of lives will be sadly missed. 
It is truly a sad day for the world.  Steve's perseverance, creativity, innovation, and constant challenge of the rules proves that if you believe in yourself and do what you feel is right you will be successful and happy in the end.  When all others doubted him he pushed onward towards his goal.  Looking back it is so clear that he was decades ahead of his time.  Steve's impact on this world surrounds all of us.  Let his life be celebrated and his legacy be an inspiration to all.
When the Beatles broke up I thought: why the big deal?  Now I know.&nbsp;
He can now truly see the impact he made on the world. And we all can embrace him in our hearts - after all - he connected us all.  One. Amazing. Man.   With so much love
I never had a chance to meet Steve, but he inspired me many times.    Rest in Peace Steve.
Steve is the world's greatest visionary who has changed the world and our lives.  He will be deeply missed.&nbsp;
miss you steve , thank you to bring a lot good thing in our life !   Ray Lau 
I heard that Steve has died and this made me so sad. His inspiration will glow in the dark forever.  And we will miss him forever.
 I´m so sorry: Steve Jobs was my mentor. Simply Steve Jobs was my GOD and he is my best teacher, he will be forever on our hearts. I lost a big part of my soul. Thanks u Steve Jobs&nbsp;
I am only 11 and he inspired me to make an iPhone app...
Steve Jobs drove my diligence in writing tight elegant code back in the early days of Mac vs DOS. My career took a different direction and I have now just started writing apps for the iPhone. We have lost a giant.
You have given the best of you so that I can give the best of me. Thank you!
I have had an amazing long-term love for computers beginning with programing basic on an Apple II+ in high school in 1980. &nbsp;I am now a physics teacher of 25 years in part because of my early positive experiences in science, mathematics, and technology. &nbsp;I have owned Apple computers continuously from 1984 to the present, upgrading every two-three years. &nbsp;It has been 31 wonderful years since my first days of programing on an Apple. &nbsp;Thank you Steve!&nbsp;
The output of your life has always been a part of mine and it always will be.  
I have a business in Australia and this business would  never have existed without Apple.  Apple has shown the way; the way to creative thinking, the way to  inventive vision and creation, and the way to simplify and enhance our  lives.  I thank you Steve Jobs for your gifted mind and utterly dedicated  spirit. And your ability to see things get done. Thanks also for showing us that companies don't have to be consumers of  people. They can help people fly.  It's so sad to hear of your untimely death but a reminder to us all that  money cannot buy life.  Go out and live.  Steve would like that.
Steve Jobs will go down in history as one of the greats.  His influence upon the world thru computers will leave a lasting handprint on human civilization. 
prayers go out to his family and friends. may God bring peace in your hearts. steve will always be remembered  --  God Bless
Steve,  In a world of Chaos you showed us a beacon of simplicity and beauty.  With Macbook Air you made us believe computers can be sexy again.  You have done so much, so well. I wish you had stayed with us a little  longer.  You and Apple will be remembered.
 I just wanted to give my regards to the guy because he did so much for the tech world. One of the forefathers of the first Computers to the Iphone and wonderful Ipad, I thank Mr Jobs and hope the legacy of his ideas and innovations stay with apple for years to come. Don't let him down Apple veterans.&nbsp;
He was "Technology"!.......and.........Technology will never be the same!   Steve, you will be deeply missed
Thank you, Steve. My life changed since have contact with Apple products. Wish you happy and lead a peaceful life in the paradise. Your spirit  will live in our minds! Thank You! 
I have nothing but tears in my eyes since the moment I heard Sreve's passing. May God give peace to the departed soul!  I will always remember you.&nbsp;
My respects and condolences to his family. The world has lost a great man.
This man was and will always be a visionary. a pillar, and a true example to dedication, innovation. and leadership. May our Lord rest his soul and grant him eternal peace.
I can not convey the emotions I am feeling. I knew Steve Jobs only through the news and the keynote presentations, but I feel as though I have lost a friend. The man changed my life with incredible products. If there is a heaven or afterlife I hope to see him when I get there! Thanks Steve for all your ideas!!&nbsp;
OUR deepest condolences to the family..rest in peace..  Reina 
Our family send our sincerest sympathy to ALL of Mr. Job's family, friends and his Apple Family.  We are all Apple product enthusiasts and loved him in a  way as a distant family member. May the Apple brand and all who love him continue to strive in good spirits and much success in his memory.
You proved the world you could run better your company, with sneakers,  jeans and a black shirt, than the suits of the competition could. Jobs there will always be plenty but Steve Jobs there will only be one. Rest in peace. 
 I just wanted to say thank you.Thank you for making my childhood great, with Buzz and Woody. &nbsp;Thank you for giving me one of the best friends I ever had...the iPod. &nbsp;Thank you for making the world a better place. &nbsp;Please, rest in peace. You earned it. &nbsp;Stay hungry, Stay foolish. &nbsp;I learned.&nbsp;
Thank you so much for bringing the incredible Apple products to the world. You are a legend and we will never forget you!  I wish you have fun in the heaven.  Rest in Peace. Bye bye.  -- 
Apple is more than a company, it's a culture. The company's success and brilliance, shown through their products, has revolutionized technology. Apple has made its mark on the world. We all owe Steve our gratitude for creating Apple and changing our lives with his visions. It is with heartfelt sadness that we must say goodbye to him.
Such a visionary and awesome person,  a Genius. Hope His memories and his vision will keep on our devices!  RIP
I am so saddened to hear the news and send my heartfelt condolences to   his friends and family.  He was truly a visionary and inspiring human   being and his stories will continue to inspire me!
We have lost a Genius and a Great Human Being.  The world has changed  because of you, Steve Jobs!  Rest In Peace. <br>
Steve Jobs  You will be aways in my heart, thank you for inspiring me and my life
Steve Jobs a true legend has passed, I thank you for years of remarkable  inovative products.  You will always be remembered
Hi. I am Japanese Apple fan. And I am Steve Jobs fan.  Sorry I can't speak English well.  But, I really meant to say is thanks.   Thank you, Apple.  Thank you, Steve Jobs.  I'm a fan of you always.   Thank you
I have never met Mr. Jobs but he has had a profound impact on my life. His company reflects on how you don't have to conform and it's ok to stand out and push things to the limit. Many compare him to Edison, I would like to compare him to Tesla. Stood up for what he believed in and made it his own.&nbsp;
As I type this from my Macbook Pro  checking my iPhone for messages I am  deeply saddened by the loss of such a great inventor. This man has  changed the world as we know it. We owe Steve so much for what he has  done for society. Our prayers and thoughts are with his family.
This man saved Apple from disappearing to oblivion, revolutionized the all-in one with the candy iMacs, revolutionized the portable player industry with the iPod and led the way for the smart phone revolution with the iPhone. Steve Jobs is THE MAN!  I have been using Apple products for around 15+ years, being a designer, and I could not help but feel I owe this amazing man so much. I still have my WORKING first gen 5gb iPod, gone through G4, G5, iMac, Mac Mini, MacBook, Nano, iPhone 4, etc, etc, etc......  Steve Jobs is part of my life!  I will miss him dearly.  Prayers to his family and friends
Thank you for making the world a better place through your wonderful   product innovations &amp; great movies.  Truly an Apple in the eyes of the people you've touched.  Rest in Peace, Mr Jobs.  Godspeed.&nbsp;
Steve meant so much to me, yet I never had the chance to meet him. When  I was growing up, we had Apple II's in our elementary computer lab,  which sparked a fascination within that has only grown. Later, when I  heard about Mr. Jobs, what he was like, and what he had already  accomplished, a role model was set.  I'm a Computer Science Junior at  Missouri State University, with a job that allows me to do what I love:  code. I have and will always look up to the high standard, who is Steve.&nbsp;
The world lost a great Man... A visionary and responsible for the best creations of our modern world. Rest In peace... Are my sincere condolences to the family Jobs and the world...&nbsp;
I'm so shocked when I learned this sad news this morning, not only because Steve Jobs' death but this world lost a great human being. Steve has changed the way people living in so many ways. In Taipei, Taiwan, you can see 5 (or even more) of 10 people using the iPhone when you walking in the street, taking the bus. Using iPhone it's a lifestyle to me, and I'll still looking forward about what's new from Apple.  R.I.P Steve Job  and  Keep Fighting Apple!
When I first laid my fingers on the keyboard of the very first Macintosh with its tiny little screen, I had no idea how much Apple would change my life. More than 20 years later, myself and my family own or have owned almost every piece of technology Apple has ever produced. We find ourselves lost when we are without a little piece of Apple to get us through the day as efficiently as possible.   What an incredible loss to Apple. What an incredible loss to the world. Steve Jobs changed mine and so many other's lives more than we even realize. He has everyone wondering: "how did we ever manage before Apple came along?"   Our condolences to the Jobs family, the Apple family and all who knew and appreciated what an amazing contribution Steve Jobs made to our world. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Not sure I have ever felt this deep of a sadness for an individual I had never met. I can only surmise that it stems from what I became (an Art Director) due in part to my trusted Macs through the years. From the first Mac in our house in 1984 to this day I have never worked on anything but an Apple computer. My deepest condolences to his family and the Apple community.&nbsp;
you change everything for the better, you gave us dreams. Now we can feel that the world will not be the same without you. I miss you so much&nbsp;
I got a opportunity to work for Apple...when our startup got acquired...the dream of several people came true...  I had to move on shortly ...but just the feeling of seeing this genius ..fight personal tragedy and...go...on is what ..life is all about  If we believe in Steve ...let's not take tomorrow for granted....let's do the next miracle we want today...  Steve .... We wait for u to comeback and make another revolution for mankind&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is not dead, he lives every time a message is sent from my and your iPhone&nbsp;
   Thanks you and good bye STEVE JOBS.....WE WILL REMEMBER YOU ..R.I.P              
With tears in my eyes and a knot in my throat I write this email. I feel terribly sad, Mr. Jobs inspired not only a generation of professionals and the people working with him in Apple, but also regular people all over the world, like me, to achieve our dreams, and dream big. His legacy as one of the brightest minds of the 20th. century, and probably the 21st. too, will live on forever. As I report this terrible news in the fb page of my job, I cannot pick only a few achievements of his life, I cannot post all the wonderful things he did along with the people who worked with him. The world will not be the same without him. My deepest condolences to the Apple family. I wish I could say more, but I just can't, I ran out of words.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for the Great Ideas and Vision that you had. You have made the world a much better place for everyone.   You will be remembered forever!&nbsp;
You are my idol, my spiritual leader, my reason for loving Apple without condition. I still cannot believe this is true. Please rest in peace! Love you forever, Jobs!!!&nbsp;
I sit here recollecting and typing on the first Apple product that I purchased five years ago, the MacBook. You are one of the greatest innovator of our time. Just like this laptop, your ideas, your imagination, your creativity, and your legacy will never be die.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs was truly a man who made a difference by focusing on the Big Picture rather than the petty and the mundane. The big picture was often something the rest of us had not yet seen, and his sense of infinite possibilities should be his legacy to us. I'm just a guy who bought Apple products, but like so many Apple fans, I always knew who Steve was, and appreciated him.     
I am profoundly sadden by the passing of such a visionary man who has touched so many lives.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family.
 He lives and still touches us still in every day of our lives, via every piece of creations he has given us!
Steve was an amazing person and an incredible gift to all of us throughout the world.  A heartbreaking loss to say the least!  Thank you for your incredible input not only in my life but in my world!  You will never be forgotten . RIP Steve Jobs And thank you&nbsp;
I would personally like to thank everyone at the Apple team for truly   making a difference in not only my world, but many others as well. The Apple products I have utilized since elementary school have opened   up doors for me I had once thought impossible. Steve Jobs' creativity, perseverance and genius spawned ideas which   have helped educate and connect so many people on this earth- and   today marks a time of remembrance for such drive, imagination and   skill. I hope to, someday, make even half the difference in someone's   life that Steve and the Apple team have made in mine. Thank you Steve, and thank you Apple. Steve Jobs won't soon be   forgotten. Condolences, thanks, tears and cheers&nbsp;
Dear Steve, Its a sad day to me, Miss you. 
Steve changed the world. 
God bless you! Your soul now is finding a better place. Rest in peace!&nbsp;
I can't believe he's gone!I just finished reading a book written by Jay Elliot about him. Always admired him so much and I'm extremely sorry for this loss. He wasn't only a creator, he was a genius, a very special person. I think this sadness it's extended to the whole world. I'd like to extend my condolences for all the Apple Family, but specially for his wife and sons.
The world has lost a dream builder.  The technology as we know was made by dreamers like Steve.&nbsp;
I was just 11 years old when my father brought home our Apple IIe. I am now a Sr. Web Developer at a major supply company. This man's creations had such a profound impact on me. In so many ways. I can still remember it now...... BRUN (short for binary run) Asteroids. In my opinion, there has not been such a transcending figure in America since Abraham Lincoln. A true American and innovator. He will be missed.
 Steve Jobs...thanks for the Intelligence, Passion, Motivation, and Spirit that you had shown to the world from your life and from your Apple. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs.....God bless you.&nbsp;
I am truly sorry for your loss. I wish his family and his company the very best.&nbsp;
We will remember you for ever. And I will tell your story to my children in the future. Stay hungry, stay foolish, I will always remember in my heart. 
To All Who May Read This, I am very sorry for our loss.  Steve Jobs was a pioneer in an industry  that needed men like him.  His innovation and drive is what has made a  miracle of modern technology so easily taken for granted on a day to day  basis.  He was a man with passion for what he did and it touched those  that invest in and use Apple products everyday like myself.  I can only  hope that our memories of him do him justice and that a piece of him  lives on forever in Apple.&nbsp;
We are proud Apple MacBook Pro owners.   Steve Jobs and his brilliance  made a difference for many others including us.  We would like to send  our sincere condolences to the Jobs Family for the loss of their beloved  and irreplaceable family member.  Our thoughts our also with the Apple  "Family members" as they  mourn the loss of their admired founder  as  well.  He absolutely made our modern-day world a better place as he  graced us with his genius.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a great man.&nbsp;
Dear Apple, Steve Jobs was a man, a husband, a father, an employer but above all a visionary and a genius. He gave people hope, he gave people beliefs and through the plethora of iOS devices produced, he gave people a sense of magic. Words wont express the sadness thousands and millions are feeling but what we look forward to is the knowledge that Steve Jobs live in every Apple products that were and will be produced. 
How fitting that such a great number of us our sharing our mourning through devices created by Steve that have become a part of our everyday lives. Regards, Aaron Apter Sent from my iPhone... that Steve created. 
I'm writing from Germany and it's pretty late here.&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;excuse my simple and bad english... I just heard about the very sad news. Fans never kew their 'celebrities' personally, so like me. But I feel for his Friends and his Family now. For me, he was a real genius. He changed the way how human live.  I mean, it's so unbelievable what we've done in the last&nbsp;Years. We (as the human species) invented things, which are just magic! Thank you, Steve Jobs -  for your work, for your&nbsp;enthusiasm, for your visions... for your great keynotes. Just for everything! Me, and the world will never forget you... &nbsp;&nbsp;
Steve Jobs has been a great innovator just like Einstein or Alexander Graham Bell. His enormous&nbsp;discoveries&nbsp;have inspired&nbsp;many people.&nbsp;Thank you for&nbsp;creating so many amazing gadgets... RIP Steve.
You save the whole world of technology, not only you created the  macintosh, but also brought the technology into a brand new world. You  defined the true meaning of "personal computer." A great innovator has fallen, but no one could ever ease you from our  heart. I just want to cry out loud, You saved the Apple, saved the technology,  and saved the world. But yet no one can save you. Rest in Peace Mr. Steve Jobs, the world will cry for you.
I'm a fan, follower, friend and lover of all things Apple. Steve Jobs was a hero to the geek in all of us; a brilliant visionary who carried his convictions to completion. So sorry to hear he wasn't able to beat his illness, the world has lost a bright flame, a voice who gave us so much.  I have been able to remain self employed in a home office because Steve Jobs gave me my freedom: with computers and other innovations that are fast and easy to use. I fell in love with my first Mac and I've never looked back. Steve Jobs changed the world and he will be missed.  His fire burned out today, but we will keep the flame burning with our loyalty and our hope for the future of Apple. And in the end, it isn't about money, or things, or anything.  My condolences to all of you who worked with and knew this fearless leader.
Thank you Mr. Steve Jobs for changing our world in a supremely positive and exciting way like no other technology creator has! You have impacted millions of people's lives in a brilliant, unequal way. Thank you for making powerful, user-friendly, and beautiful technological tools that set the standard for all technology companies now and forever. God bless you, your wife, and your children. Happy journey in the cosmic eternal light that is our very being. 
He was the one who brought Apple to become the most successful company in the world. Losing such kind of people is the most saddess thing! Hope he can live peacefully in other world. We will remember you and all the things you did for Apple and for us. R.I.P&nbsp;
The world lost Steve. May the world always remember him.
Steve was a brillant man, who inspired me to do many things of my life  and to trust myself. Today the world lost a visionary and a big genius.  Steve leaves today, but his legacy will be forever. I send my  condolences and I am sure that right now he is in a much better place. RIP Steve jobs
Thanks for "pinch to zoom" our amazing world
Thanks for all you have done, we love you. Rest in peace, Steve. 
Thank You Steve!  Thank you for your imagination and your determination to share your vision with us.  You have enriched our lives.  Rest Now....  You will be missed! &nbsp;
Steve Jobs you will be forever be missed..... You changed the world with your vision.
Jobs, You've been an inspiration to my life and the reason I want to be an entrepreneur. You've defined risk taking and how to overcome adversity. And to follow your dreams and drive through it with passion.  Sad to see you gone.  My thoughts and prayers go to your family.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. You have changed my world forever. I will always  remember you as a great person!
The world lost a great man, my inspiration. Very creative, man.  Every time we turn on our apple, we apple lovers, he will be remember!  To his wife and kids, thank you for sharing this great man, with the rest o f the world.  Never had the honor to meet him in person, but every apple gadget represent  him.  God bless you&nbsp;
 Our prayers are with The Jobs Family as well as the Apple Family. We look around our home and owe such  gratitude to Steve Jobs  for his vision and to each of you for your hard work. Apple technology has opened doors in both  educational and entertainment  areas that we could not have imagined when  we were children. Peace to you as you celebrate Steve Job's life and work and mourn his death .&nbsp;
Steve, wherever you are, thanks for inspiring us to believe in ourselves, in our dreams and for encouraging us to stay hungry, to stay foolish.
Thank you for sending us your dream.&nbsp;
I have long appreciated the work inspired by Steve Jobs. It was thanks  to his vision and insight that laid a vast part of the foundations of  what we, today call the IT industry. He always delighted his followers  and challenged his competitors. With him gone, the world will be a  little less... refined.  Thank you Steve Jobs and Good Bye. We will miss you terribly.
Thank you for changing the world. Politics couldn't change it, but you  did. Your in a better place now. Rest in peace
 Steve you have my respect and gratitude, you were a genius, thank you, thank you for having given his love of technology.&nbsp;
It is completely shocking to hear this terrible and utterly disturbing news.   Steve created so many revolutionary pieces of technology that we all use and love.  Two weeks ago I did a presentation regarding Steve Jobs as if he was going to present to my class.  It's scary how such events have unfolded.  We all knew that he was unwell for quite some time, but to actually know that he is gone, is just completely overwhelming and sad.  I shed tears of sadness to his passing but tears of pride of his legacy.  Steve Jobs will forever be missed for most, but truly from my heart.  Rest in Peace Steve.&nbsp;
I send my condolences, he sounds like he was a great visionary and his  passion for apple will be missed. 
Dear Steve's family and Apple, as a strong follower of Steve, it's a sad day for me to learn about this news. Please accept my condolences. Steve Jobs' legacy will forever lives!
What I appreciate most about Steve Jobs' is that he must have had such a strong character that he had the ability to lead amazingly talented people without getting in the way and remained a guiding force.  This rare gift combined with the talent at Apple is the winning combination that produced unparalleled products. 
Mr Jobs, You are an inspirational human being.  The Earth will not be the same place without you.  It is amazing how you and your company have pushed the world into the future.  Everyone should attempt to, but few will succeed in the pace that you set for creating truly incredible products, and technology within.   I think you must have come from the future, because you were years ahead of your time.  Thank you for making many things in my life easier, and fun to do.  Rest in Peace. 
It's strange to feel so emotionally attached to someone I have never met in person, but, somehow I feel attached to Steve Jobs. He touched my imagination, which is the best gift I can think of from another human. Thank you Steve, thank you Steve's family.
I wish to express my condolences to Mr. Job's family, friends, colleagues, and loved ones. I will remember him as a person who knew how to turn his ideas into beautiful machines. I will also remember that the first computer I ever had was the Apple Macintosh. I spent endless hours behind that computer just trying to discover all its capabilities.      Today we lost a great man. May you go in peace, Steve Jobs.         
I was so saddened to hear of Steve Jobs' passing. What makes it so sad is that he had so much to live for. He gave so much back to society and inspired so many. He really enjoyed life and what he did and it showed. He will be remembered in history as a great man of the technology era &nbsp;and a great human being. I am sure his family will remember his as a wonderful husband and father. My condolences to his family and to his Apple family. He was amazing!
Steve Jobs was man of incomparable vision, creativity, and humility. His  legacy lives on!  May his family find solace in the fact that he is now  at peace.&nbsp;
Sem dúvida alguma, posso afirmar em nome de todos os brasileiros que acompanharam a carreira de Steve Jobs, que ele não será apenas lembrado como um execultivo habilidoso, ou um desenvolvedor de produtos de sucesso; mas sim como um idealizador, um homem com uma visão a frente de seu tempo, um verdadeiro dissipador de idéias, quem não se lembra da evolução com a chegada do primeiro iphone, ou seria revolução. Independentemente disso, a mensagem que desejo deixar é a de que o mundo não será mais o mesmo e que nós perdemos acima de tudo um grande ser humano.
I remember the picture on the cover of Time magazine.  I was living in NJ at the time, and had no idea that this one person would have such a profound impact on my life.  Years later, after I moved to California, business caught up with the "computer craze" and it was a whole new world of exploration on how the digital revolution made my job and personal communications easier.  Thanks, Steve, for being so creative and successful.  Best wishes for the Jobs family - they can be proud of his legacy.  I hope that knowing what a positive influence he was and will continue to be with the Apple lifestyle will be a source of comfort.  Godspeed. 
What a lost!!!!  Steve made my life happier than ever with his inventions. We lost not only the Apple's founder, but also a great human being. We will always remember you, Steve, what you did for us!!! Thanks! Go in peace!
Dear Jobs Family:  Our most sincere condolences.   The light of your loved one will forever inspire the world.
The passing of Steve Jobs is a terrible loss for the advancement of  humankind.
What an unbelievable person!! The world is a better place today because of him. He will be remembered for centuries to come and to have known of him is a true honor.&nbsp;
Strange, but the first thing I searched when I heard the news was, "when did Albert Einstein die"...&nbsp;
Steve Jobs had that drive and ambition to make a company such as Apple Computers to be a giant in the computer industry. His lifelong passion to have the vision for Apple was a driving force throughout his life and he never stopped to continually revolutionize Apple even during difficult times for the company. What a giant of a man Steve Jobs was and will always be remembered by Apple and those that worked with him.     Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
steve is a good bloke if it was not for him we would not have all the  apple stuff we have now to respect him i say thank you so much for what  you have built and the work that went behind it all R.I.P
I am so sorry that Steve Jobs has died, someone who didn't deserved it,  did so much for the world and failed to overcome this disease but was a  worthy example of struggle, perseverance and humanity. Reach these words  to his wife and children and all who were fortunate to meet and work  with it, I had no such luck. All I can say is that I am a MacAddict and  change my life. RIP
He taught us to "Think Different", be creative and always be ourselves.  Fighting for what we love, always takes us as far as we're stronger to  keep fighting. Thanks to him, Apple made great things, and so will  make a lot more. From a MAC user, with all her love, to Steve. For Steve, we think  different.
Steve was one of my psychological mentors.  From the day that the  Apple II came out I've been an Apple fan.  I was devastated when the  board forced Steve out, but of course I was ecstatic when he came back.  I  knew on that day that Apple would become a force in the world that  hadn't been seen since the boom days of the industrial revolution. The impact Steve has had on the world cannot be measured.  We will miss  his leadership, his engaging personality, and his visionary mind.  All the very, very best to both his families.  His personal family as  well as his business family.&nbsp;
 "Now it's time to say good night, Close your eyes and I'll close mine. Now the sun turns out his light, Close your eyes and I'll close mine. Good night sleep tight."            
I bought my first iMac when my wife wouldn't use my linux PC in 2000. 3  iMacs, 3 iPods and 1 MacBook Pro later, please keep Steve's vision and  drive for ease of use alive 
Our family will miss him dearly.  We owe most of our household  technology to him, with that we will think of him daily.  Rest in peace Steve! 
GOD BLESS STEVE JOBS!   --&nbsp;
You are a shining example to the world of what hard work, perseverance  and love for people can produce. In a world filled with "greed is good" and "anything goes" philosophies,  you were a rare example of a man with integrity. Rest in peace and Thank you. 
Steve Jobs is the man who inspired me to be an entrepreneur. To seek Innovation through passion in what I do every day. I could listen his speech at the Stanford University a thousand times. He was right when he said that our time is limited, and we should never waste it living someone else's life.  Steve Jobs Inspired me and many other young people to be as passionate as he was. To look after what we love and give some of that to other people. Its a fact that Steve will never be gone, we just wouldn't let that happen.
Profoundly touched by tour brillant life and attitude.  The way you lived inspired us.  Sad to see a chunk of the Apple go away so soon.  My sympathie for the familiy.  You can be proud, very proud of him...
Please accept my dearest condolences. I am in so much  shock, as only a few hours ago I was watching the keynote speech introducing iPhone4S. Throughout the entire presentation, I kept missing Steve's charisma and wished he was in that stage - nothing against Mr. Cook... but Steve's presentations were something to look for.  And now the world has turned. I feel like I lost a family member. I own every "toy" Apple has made in the last 5 years. I looked forward to his big and flashy new product announcements a couple of times a year. Being an Apple owner was like being part of a family. My prayers go to his family and close friends. May God keep him in his Glory. May he continue to watch his company from wherever he is.  Godspeed, Steve, we will miss you!
Because of him I have a phone, music and the Internet all in my hand!!! THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR VISIONS AND GREATNESS!!!! I am truly sorry and my most heartfelt sympathies to all his family and friends.... RIP Mr. Jobs. 
Like many who will send similar messages I did not know Steve personally but as  a business student I had the opportunity to hear and learn about him in many  different aspects. The phrase "they changed the world" is said about so many now  its become somewhat clique but for Steve it is all true. Steve's creativity,  passion, and visionary spirit literally changed the world we live in for the  better!!! My condolences to his family and all who knew him.&nbsp;
<font class"apple-style-span"="" face"prelude,="" verdana,="" san-serif"="">The first time I saw Mr. Jobs was when I watched a press conference for the first iPod Nano. &nbsp;I had seen iPods all over the place but I was too young to really understand technology and tech history. &nbsp;But even then, the work that Mr. Jobs had done was affecting me. &nbsp;Pixar, the iPod, the iPhone, and other technological innovations that Mr. Jobs championed have come to define my generation and, dare I say it, define me. <br><br>Mr. Jobs was the reason that I became interested in technology and the reason I am now pursuing a career in journalism, just to get the opportunity to report on tech. &nbsp;My first media player was the second gen Nano, and my first cell phone was the 3GS. &nbsp;Mr. Jobs and the innovations he pushed showed me just how beautiful and empowering modern technology can be. &nbsp;I'll always thank him and Apple for that.<br><br>A great man died today, and the world will not be the same tomorrow.</font><span id"forward_draft_text"="" class"display:none"=""></span> 
 Today, the world loses the Yoda of technological innovation.  Congratulations on being.  Always Force Jobs  Hugs.
He made great impact to my life by practicing his values. Thanks for change t he world. I send my deepest condolence to his family and Apple. <br>
Steve left the world a far better place than he found it.  That is the best legacy any of us can strive for.  My heart hugs the hearts of Steve's family.&nbsp;
He will be missed and remembered.  RIP Steve Jobs 
Steve: you change everything of our world and our way of life. Your visionarie mind be our friend, our work, our happiness, our past, present and future. Thanks for all, we gonna miss you.&nbsp;
As a "Total Mac Gal" since the 90s, I am grateful to Steve Jobs and his amazing vision, creativity and leadership. I read about his death on my iPhone, just one example of his ingenuity. My thoughts and prayers go out to his immediate family and his Apple family as well. May he spread his brilliance as he continues into his next phase of life!&nbsp;
i am a customer from china and i've always been in love jobs's products. it always bring me pleasure while using them. thanks!!! i will always remember you!&nbsp;
...one of the most inspiring human beings that ever roamed the planet... 
My condolences to the entire Apple family for your loss. I know you're probably getting tons of responses to this but I am truly sorry for your loss.  Jobs was a staple of modern technology, and he will be greatly missed.
I'm sorry. Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs was not only an inventor, he was a man with ideas, with vision, he had decision, he had one thing that most of us don't have; he had will, he  had the will to change, to progress, the view taking technology to a new level, he was capable of improving over and over again, he never gave up on anything he wanted to do, he always inspire us with his ideas, with his creations.... Steve Jobs was a great human being, and will be reminded in the hearts of everyone for the rest of time..... He didn't make his presence showed,  but his absence will be felt in everybody's heart. Heaven got another angel  tonight, cause he left this world behind. Thanks for everything; RIP Steve Jobs&nbsp;
When I know you passed away peacefully I really feel sad. You are a genius. You set up Apple. You create iPhone, iPads I love them so much. They are excellent because of your ideas. I enjoy your videos, the same they are excellent. I really hope that Apple will become better and  better without you. Though I know maybe you cannot see my letter, I want to say I love both you and apple. When I know you have cancer I really feel surprised, in my mind you are healthy and full of energy. When I see you become thinner and thinner, I felt worried. Health is the most important thing, isn't it? Though I am a Chinese, I write the letter in English, because you are a American, I really respect you. I love you.
作为一个中国人。一个苹果产品的粉丝。对于乔布斯先生的去世我感到不能相信。但是事实如此。但是喜欢继承乔布斯先生理念品质的苹果能一如既往的推出好产品。我们也将一如既往的支持苹果。让乔布斯先生的理念能一直传承下去。他是一个改变世界的人 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 一个苹果的中国粉丝 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
Although I've always been a faithful Windows user,  you have never failed to inspire me.     I believe the mobile technology you have created alongside your company will continue to be the face of the future.     I respect you, and I will never forget your wonderful achievements.     You, Steve Jobs, are an amazing guy. Rest In Peace.
Going from a child learning calligraphy to and adult creating a  lifestyle in 56 short years, steve jobs is and always will be a  visionary, rip 
 I came to shocked this morning when i found out that Steve Jobs died today.. Still, till now, my feelings still denying it but it's the truth..

What a great man and a brilliant mind that has passed. He  will live on through this amazing technology he has created for all of us. God bless you Steve and your Family.&nbsp;
Thank you for making me not settle for crummy graphics. Thank you for making me expect more every time you were on the stage. Thank you for integrating the creative with the geek. Thank you for Pixar. Thank you for being the visionary you were. Thank you for everything...  And one more thing; We'll miss you Steve :( 
Rest in peace Steve Jobs, you revolutionized the world and we truly  thank you for that. 
Thanks Steve. You'll live forever in our hearts.  
Although I never met him in person, I feel I connected with his spirit in the products and innovations he brought to Mother Earth.  May he rest in peace.
Thank you so much for all the magical products that you brought to us.  We will all truly miss you.&nbsp;
I am sad to know that this genius has passed away. Apples are everywhere  in my home, from iPod, iphone to iMAC.  People will remember him forever.&nbsp;
God had a blinding burst of Insight.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve, thank you! You've been the example that with courage, determination and passion dreams come true. Rest in Peace!
Dear Steve,   I was there at MacWorld 2005 when you unveiled the "iPhone"   As a designer &amp; feature film editor and loyal customer to the amazing company you built, I also felt as if you were another father to me. In my lifetime, I've watched you touch so many people with your creativity, hard work ethic and dedication to your fans. I'm not very religious, but I do believe there is another life after one passes. My only wish is that you are still watching down to see the amazing new breakthroughs and keynotes Apple unveils in the future. I also want you to know that when I saw your death announced on Apple.com, I saw it in Safari, on my MacBook Pro, while I was listening to my iPod, playing "words with friends" on my iPhone 3GS and (finally) working in Final Cut Pro.   I will always remember you as a pioneer and as a father of the modern computer.   Rest in Peace,&nbsp;
An inspiration to everyone.  He showed us to never give up and always follow your passion.  He changed my life by providing experiences (not just products) that I shall love forever. Farewell Steve: we'll never forget you or what you did for us. He leaves giant iShoes to fill.&nbsp;
Hello, I'd like to remember Steve by working with, playing on, listening to my various Apple devices tonight...wait, I did that last night. And the night before...and the night before that, and the....  So long and thank you Steve.&nbsp;
Rest in peace  we love mac very much.&nbsp;
I feel as those must have felt when they lost JFK or Albert Einstein.  My sadness is deep, for I cannot begin to imagine what truly spectacular future technology we have lost with the passing of Steve Jobs.  God speed.
rest in peace Steve.  The Human race has been indelibly changed because of you.  We will never forget what you brought to us and you live on forever in our hearts.&nbsp;
rip to the worlds genius changed the world in his simple existence may  such a advanced soul rest in peace and now make the heavens have  technology :) love and will miss you apple wont be the same. 
God bless him he was one of the greatest minds of today. I was shocked and was at a loss for when I heard of the loss of the greatest CEO's ever. 
To the Jobs family and Apple staff: &nbsp;I'm a medical doctor. Over the course of my short 25 years I have witnessed a change in the world at a velocity I cannot even begin to measure. It has affected us all personally and professionally. Whether it is how i care for and communicate with my patients, run my business or how i call my mother, the contributions of Steve Jobs and Apple cannot be captured by a simple time line. I feel so lucky having grown up in this technology era and have Mr. Jobs and the Apple team to thank for it. May his innovation and spirit live on with his team and his family.&nbsp;
 IPhone 4S  IPhone 4ever Steve "Stay hungry, stay foolish".  He was loved but God loved him more. Rest in Peace. His legend will live on.            
Mr. Jobs, Thank you. For way you lived, thought, and the way you have held yourself throughout your life. The results of your determination and hard work have become attached to my life, like many others around the world. Thank you again.&nbsp;
dear steve, im listening music through the iPod. i was very impressed for your imaginitive and innovative thinking. it's mourn to me. bye steve. ur the best ceo and innovator in the world.
&nbsp;I have bought my "first Iphone 4" recently. Wow... I remember the "Iphone 4 Launch" in Brasil - it was terrible to find one... So, I need wait almost one year to get mine.  So... I have few words to say "for Steve Jobs" (and his company): THANK YOU!  Steve Jobs: you´ll always be on my mind as in my friend´s mind, my family´s mind, and THE WORLD´s mind.  THANK YOU, Steve Jobs, to teach us your life experience, your knowledge, your life way as "how to live".  THANK YOU!
We have lost someone very special, inspiring and someone who has given so much to all of us and significantly impacted our lives in very positive way.  I can only hope that in some way, we in turn, shared our gratitude and appreciation for the American icon Steve Jobs truly was in this world...  He will be missed dearly.   My deepest and heartfelt condolences to Steve's family, the Apple family and all those that were a part of his life.
Steve, it is hard to imagine a time where you were not changing our lives and bringing technology to enhance and surprise us. Your spirit and person wil l be missed immensely -- you are one of a kind. And one more thing, every time I use my Apple products, your visions and acc omplishments live on.
Steve Jobs is a man who helped lead the world into a new and exciting   place and while his legacy is one of a technological nature, I'm sure   there are many friends and family who have lost a good friend and   ally. My condolences to those who grieve.
Steve Jobs was an inspiration to me. I will not ever forget the first time I  put my hands on an Apple IIe, a Mac, a Lisa, the NeXt, an iMac, an iPod, a Shuffle, a Nano, an iPod Touch, a Mac Pro Titanium G4 laptop, a Mac Pro Intel  Itanium Quad Core, an iPad, a Mac Mini, and my current MacPro Intel Duo Core i7.20 Each one of these devices had breakthrough design, breakthrough technology, coolness, but most importantly groundbreaking innovation at the cutting edge of intuitive conceptual thinking. As an Engineer, a Software Developer, a Technologist and an innovator in my own right, I have nothing but admiration for this man. He will will be sorely  missed.&nbsp;
I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to the great man who have  changed my world and perceptions to technology, Steve Jobs. You will  always be remembered by me every time I will use my iPhone, my iMac, my  MacbookPro, my iPad and my iPod. I will have your picture pasted on my  wallpaper to remember the man who gave the world the better options. May you rest in peace.
I will always remember Steve Jobs the way I remember Newton or Einstein.  
I lived with Apple products for over 20 years, ever since the first Macintosh on which I wrote my college thesis. Thank you Steve for making our lives better!!
Thank you for showing us a little of the 23rd Century today. You were a true  genius and inspiration to so many. I can't imagine my life today without the things you created. You will be truly missed and my thoughts are with your  family during this difficult time. Rest in peace Steve!&nbsp;
I never talk or saw him other than on the news or apple web site, but   I think he has charged the world, for the better. I hope Apple keeps   going the way it is, but I think it will never be the same. 
I'll miss you Steve. Thanks.
Even though I am just a "fan", I felt like there was no better person in the world. Steve Jobs was beyond words, he was simply...... amazing. His ideas were out of this world, they were things no other human could think of. He started the true technology era. Steve Jobs helped Apple conquer the world. With his death, we all lose a leader, more than that a genius. Steve Jobs was the Speaker of my Keynote, the CEO of Apple. He was the Apple of my I and the light of my life.
When I first took a bite of an Apple product I was hooked, when I first  heard a Steve Jobs keynote presentation I was sold. My family extends it  deepest sympathies to the Jobs family, both biological and corporate.  Thanks, Steve, you made better, sweeter, and more efficient our world..  Rest in Peace!
I remember that when I first got my iPad, I was as happy as I ever was. Same  with the other products. Steve was an inspiration and the creator of not just apple, but the high technology age. When I first heard that Steve was dead, I stopped breathing, I dropped my pencil, and I was shocked. He was my best friend: we emailed, facetimed, and talked to each other daily. He will never get out of my heart, and everyone knows that Steve is apple, and apple is Steve.
 My sincere condolences to all of Steve Jobs family &amp; The Apple family, Mr Jobs you more than most people left the world a better place. We now have the greatest example of what being good looks like and we now have a greater sense of community. Mr Jobs because of you we are all better people, we are connected emotionally now.  P.S. My dad passed away at the same age and the same cancer in 1998. I learned most of what I know  because of his memoirs.  Rest in Peace.  My prayers are with all of you.
Thank you for many things. Have a good rest good bye.
Dear Steve, I wish I would have been able to write you this while you were still  with us.  You were an inspiration to me and have truly shaped my life  more than you could have known.  With the introduction of the first  generation iPod I feel like i was raised by the products only you and  your management could dream up.  I was introduced into music, video  editing and an amazing operating system very young and was an early Mac  fanatic, before the company even took off. You have always been and always will be one of the smartest men to go  down in history to me, and You will be seriously missed. I know you're  in a better place and will forever remember you. My thoughts and prayers go to you, your family and your amazing company.
Steve we miss you like a family member. Even though you don't know us  there are millions of fans who likes you and your name will be remembered as long as there is life on earth. Steve Family and Friends...we share your sorrow and pray for his soul. RIP Steve Jobs.
A great loss to all.&nbsp;
It is with great sadness to hear of Steve Jobs passing, to me he was the  greatest innovator of his time. The world has lost a remarkable man. God bless him and his family. 
I cannot believe or accept the fact that my all time hero "Steve Jobs" is no longer living in this world. Personally, Steve Jobs has been my inspiration in many ways. Steve Jobs, you will always be remembered. May your soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
Dear Apple family I am deeply sorry for the lost of Mr. Jobs. He had a remarkable life, a vis ionary entrepreneur and excellent skills as a business man. Apple is a part of my daily routine, when I make a phone call from iPhone,  when I read the news in the iPad, when I check my emails in the Macbook Pro  or when I do some work in the iMac. I would like to thank Steve and everyone at Apple for giving us technologies that have made our lives more connected, faster and easier. At any Apple product I own, Steve will live forever . Best wishes to everyone and may Steve rest in peace.
I was truly heartbroken to learn about Steve Jobs' death, this evening. I would like to say that, not knowing him, his passing has little impact on my life, but I am writing this email on my MacBook (my third Mac), while my iPhone 4 and iPod Nano are charging on the side table next to me. My first paper was written on an Apple IIC when I was ten (I didn't understand the 'delete' feature, and kept having to restart the word processing program (it was a frustrating day). That same computer is where I played Frogger, Lemonade Stand and Carmen Sandiego, and followed me to High School. When it finally died, I got a Lap Top, one of Apple's first, and I loved it four four years. I can't imagine the scope of technological loss that Apple is experiencing. But I also can't imagine the personal loss his friends and family feel. I also lost my father at a very young (too young) age, and he will always not be there. It is a heartbreaking feeling, and I offer my sincerest condolences. Apple, and the Jobs family, have suffered a loss. I wish there was anything I could do to make it better, but I don't know that I can. So I just want to say, I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.&nbsp;
Kudos To Steve Jobs (1955-2011) A Visionary whose Brilliance brought us some of the sleekest most top of the line technology from his head to our Hands!!!!!!!!!!
The world is undoubtedly a better place because of what Steve Jobs did.  He will always be my hero.  Thank you Steve for changing the world.&nbsp;
Although I had no luck to see him once, although i can't afford to buy an iphone, i like apple and Jobs. Come on guys, continue making yourselves outstanding and make him be remembered forever.&nbsp;
Sad about this. Steve Jobs was probably the last superhero.  We will miss him a lot. Hope his legacy perpetuate forever!
Steve Jobs was and forever will be the greatest technological and design  integrated minded man that will ever walk the earth.
Steve, you changed my life.   See you later.&nbsp;
Steve,  The world as we know, the technology we use are indebted to you. You were always one step ahead of all the world of, the world is mourning the great man who lost today. Go with GOD and that HE be with your family.  GOODBYE GREAT GENIUS 
Dear Steve Jobs:     As your name shows "Jobs", you did great job for remained people in whole world.  You are the real hero in the history.  Your spirit will forever!!!&nbsp;
Because of Steve I always see my mother and stay close to my family  where ever they may be.  He brought the world together. Thank-you
Steve, You will be missed as person, leader and "friend" that I did not have the opportunity to become.  The other day I planned to send you a message sharing my get well wishes and prayers for a quick recovery, and prayers for you family and friends.  This is a mute point now.   These opportunities were missed.  I hope and pray that your family and friends find peace without you.  Thank you for the leadership, inspiration and experiences that you provided.  And of course for creating the wonderful products that I didn't know that I wanted or needed, and those that I did and ask you to create.  I am glad you did.  I has been great to experience your (and my) dreams brought into reality.  You have left a void in this world that few if any can fill.  See you on the other side.
You are a true leader and a world changer. 
Goodbay Steve. You will always be a genius and source of inspiration for me. I will never forget your words: "Stay hungry, stay foolish", I will be.&nbsp;
Steve, you have changed the way we live our lives and made it so much better.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve Jobs.  You lived great life, and we will always remember you.  The King of Revolutions, RIP.&nbsp;
You will be missed. God bless!!!
There are people that are born to change the world, you were one, thanks steve for being such a great example.
I pray that Steve is embarking on a fascinating new adventure with the most Creative Genius of all time, learning the fascinating mysteries of our silent, wireless prayers. I hope he hears my well-wishes and supplications for his safe journey to meet up with the God who loves him infinitely more than any of us are capable.  Peace be with you, Steve.
May God bless Steve's family through this tragic time. This world has lost a true visionary, someone who has changed the world. Now he is in a better place and can rejoice for all of the greater good he has done for this world. He is truly an angel and my prayers and condolences go out to his family and close friends. He is gone but surely not forgotten.
Today we lost a visionary genius.
Words cannot effectively express the sadness I feel to this great loss.  My sincerest condolences go out the Jobs family and to the Apple family Steve has left behind.  His legacy and memory will remain forever in our hearts.  Thank you Steve for you're inspiration and showing my children that dreams can be achieved through dedication and perseverance.  God bless and RIP.  Love and admiration.
Thank You Steve Jobs and Apple for simplifying my life and so many   others. Your innovations have changed the way a lot of us live and you  forever left your mark in this world.  Rest in Peace Steve!
My sincere condolences.  I am truly sad to discover Mr. Jobs is no  longer with us. He was a great man and he had great ideas. My media  lifestyle is based on the technology he introduced. Every moment I use  my iphone or ipad, the amazement I still get almost makes me feel like  I'm thanking him personally. Well, I guess thats what this is about. So,  Thank you Mr. Jobs for all you have done. You created products that  matter, that people need. We will celebrate you forever. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Please know that Steve and the Jobs family is in my prayers and thoughts  through this time of difficulty as I hope some comfort can be felt  through the lasting legacy and gifts his vision has given to others.
Steve, you were the greatest visionary of the computer age. We will miss you  greatly. Your design input on all your devices is unmatched! I will stick with your legacy and always remember your greatness!  Rest in peace my friend!
Since there was an Apple with you, my life became pleasant. 
For what he has said I hope to learn from. For what he has done I hope   to accomplish.  
You have changed what we expect from technology.  I will truly miss how  you turned a horse and buggy into a car.  You will be truly missed! 
Thank you for everything. Your work will always be remembered and pioneer the future generations. My deepest condolences to Job's family and friends. You will be missed dearly&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs,  we did never imagine that a single man whom we've never met, would have a profound and lasting impact in all our lives. You have changed what many sought, but no one reached since the invention of the telephone and transistor: The way we interact in the modern mobile world of technology.  Steve, we are deeply thankful for your accomplishments and very saddened that you left this world at such young age.  We are missing you. 
He was a great man. He changed the world and made it a better place. instead of Siri why not have a option and call it Steve. 
I am a student studying aerospace engineer. Though our paths differ greatly, I will always remember Steve Job's willingness to explore the unknown when no one else wants to. His family will be in my prayers.
Im inspired by apple and Steve Jobs so much that since apple posted the news  on apples web site almost everybody I know is been calling me to tell me this horrible news. May he REST IN PEACE.&nbsp;
I am a 50 year old who has lived through the changing world. I've always felt a great admiration and respect for one of the geniuses of modern XX and XXI century, Steve Jobs. His legacy will never die. My sincere condolences to his family.&nbsp;
Condolences to all the family and friends of a true human hero
Steve Jobs was a visionary. Steve Jobs was inspiring. Steve Jobs was an idol. Steve Jobs was an amazing human.  We are going to miss all those things he could have created in the future. We are going to miss his pleasant keynotes. We are going to miss his voice. We are going to miss him.  His legacy will be eternal. We would never forget you, Steve.&nbsp;
 You were truely inspiring Mr. Steve Jobs. It's like I lost a  really close friend. You were and always be inspiring me with Apple. God  bless your family. 
To friends and family of Steve,  I send all my positive energy towards you in this moment and I share the thought that Steve has really contributed to the history of mankind in a good way.  R.I.P. Steve, the whole world loves you.
  My thoughts and prayers go out to you the family of Steve Jobs.  He has created a huge legacy that will be remembered for decades to come. 
It is truly heartbreaking to see Steve pass so soon. He was truly a  great innovator and human being. To me one of the brightest people to  ever live.&nbsp;
My heart goes out to the Jobs family. I hope his family was able to enjoy some of  his greatness.&nbsp;
I was at the Green Hills Mall Apple store today. There was an Apple employee  in a rainbow tutu and silver shoes. Apple let's you be a better, more colorful YOU!  I'd love to work in an Apple store. Helping out Baby Boomers like myself. Is  Apple ready for a 56 year old woman in a tutu?  Thanks to Steve Jobs who encouraged creativity in whatever manifestation.
You will be greatly missed. Thank you for sharing your imagination with the rest of us.&nbsp;
Steve jobs will be sadly missed.  It is amazing what an impact he had made on people's everyday life with his vision /  innovation.  Even though I never  had a chance to meet him, I feel like I know a part of him.  I can not imagine what life would be like without my iPhone, iPad, etc.
Mi mas sentido pésame para los familiares y amigos de Steve Jobs. Se nos fué un grande, espero que el mundo sea parte de su herencia. &nbsp;
I'm not sure I quite understand how a man I never had a chance to meet had  such an impact in my life from the kid with first Mac 512 in 1984 to the jet set consultant who bought his first Newton, MacBook 170, and all the dozens of other devices bought from him over the years. I was always hanging on  his words and singing his praises.  He was a man of endless character and  determination. He inspired me professionally and personally. I already miss  his presence. There will be no other.
The world has lost a true genius! I didn't have the fortune to meet him in person, but every day for the past wow!, almost 30 years, his creative ideas have had a great influence in my life. Steve has slid into eternity, those of us who remain here will pray for him and remain sure his legacy will continue through the company he co-founded.&nbsp;
 Thank you for everything you've done to change the world Mr. Jobs. You are a true legend in the world, and I bet most of the people are using apple's product to share their thoughts. I MISS YOU.
because he was in it.  How many of us can say that about ourselves with confidence?   
Steve Jobs was amazing!  Smart!  and also a best friend to all!  May he rest in peace!  The man who inspired may, and even me! 
We extend our deepest sympathies to you for your terrible loss. He was a very special person. We will all miss him. May you rest in peace.  He changed my life.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs changed the way we communicate with one another. I can't think of a more important contribution to humanity. 
you will be missed as both an awesome innovator and a great person!
Today was a very sad day for me.  Riding down the road with a friend,  feeling my iPhone vibrate, and then having my heart sink. My AP Mobile  app said Steve Jobs had passed. It's a weird feeling, I must say. Having  your heart truly sink when hearing of the passing of a man not I, nor  anyone I know has ever met. However, as one who has used an Apple  product gets it. It's the simplicity, elegance, and true beauty of what  Steve gave the world. Computers, music devices, cellphones, and  countless other products no rival could touch. The world changed today.  But Steve's legacy will live on forever. My sincere condolences go out  to all of Apple, Steve's family, and the rest of the Apple community.  I'm proud to say I get to write this email on a small piece of what this  great man created. Steve, you will be missed greatly, but your spirit  will fill the piece of the apple that's missing. Although I never got  the privilege to meet you, I say with my complete sincerity; rest in  peace, friend.&nbsp;
Steve was truly ahead of his time. His ideas and creation changed the world forever. Always being at the cusp of Change and ready to embrace it. We have lost a brilliant man and a true leader. He will continue to live through his products. 
I don't know what else to say other than that I am one of the millions of people who are grateful for the time that Steve had on this earth.  Peace and comfort to his friends and family. &nbsp;
I am a tech fanatic but I never had an Apple product, always prefered to be on other platforms. However, Steve was somehow a model person for me, for what I most wanted, because he always achieved a tremendous success in every step of his life. Whatever he touched turned to gold. He is the best example of a human being that lived intensely trying to everyday change the world we live on by creating new things. The most inspiring inventor of the modern world, someone who created technology for the others to follow. He deserves my respect.  My dear Steve Jobs, rest in peace. 
I am so saddened by the news.  I had a feeling his time was coming soon, but it is still very sad.  The world has lost a true dreamer and visionary.  God bless him.  I'm sure God is asking him to do something amazing for him up in heaven.  We'll all miss you Steve.&nbsp;
Steve,  I'm brand new at Apple world. I felt doubts about leaving PC utilities  and jump into Mac. Your speech at Stanford University was definitively, even it is not  related with hardware or software decision, the reason why I join Apple  world.  I'm feel so sad see you leaving. I want to believe that I knew you  through Apple products. That's it.  My condolences to your family and all the people that loves you.&nbsp;
A visionary that I've sought to emulate has left us today. For  inspiration, I'll re-listen to his keynotes and YouTube videos. My loss  is miniscule when compared to that of his family and friends.  Condolences and best wishes from a true admirer.&nbsp;
I can hardly believe that an amazing man like Steve Jobs can one day die and leave our world orphan! He had a huge impact on our lives and the actual world and succeeded in innovating and creating new and amazing technologies, by giving us what we want and understand our needs. Hope he died in peace! Rest in peace Steve, may your soul be amount those living in paradise.&nbsp;
 You made a difference, thanks and rest in peace - you more than anyone  deserve it ... you presence will be forever in every Apple product. 
I am the IT Manager. I have had the honour of working with and monitoring an 'all apple' office. All because of the creation of Steve Jobs. Awful news. Our heartfelt feelings go towards his family and the many staff members of Apple who have had the honour of working with him. Our deepest sympathies, from all.
Today is a very sad day for me, my family and friends because Steve was an inspiring man for each of us. We follow his career and his teaching. We are sure that only Steve have the vision to change the (tech) world. Our prayers are with him and our heart and soul too. And the best way to show him is using his dreams, ipod...iphone..ipad...ibook... Live forever Steve!&nbsp;
Steve, you changed my life in so many ways through the years and have  always been a hero to me. thank you so much for all that you  accomplished. I have a t-shirt that says, "I had a Mac before they were  cool".
I am 33 and this is the first death of a person outside of my family  that made me cry. Without his visions and products we wouldn't be able  to live the life we've come to know. Our prayers for his family and  close friends. 
One imaginator went home. A whole new future, missing. Rest in peace, Steve.&nbsp;
Approximately a month ago I went on a trip to Las Vegas and San Francisco by myself. I am not a united states citizen, I'm from Colombia and I was visiting the west coast which I never did before. Prior to starting my trip, I filled my iPod touch 4 gen(which I recently bought) with maps, bus routes, information about sightseeing and a lot of different apps and notes that helped me all along my trip. For all I know I could be lost right now in the streets of San Francisco, or my trip could have been a very confusing nightmare. I want to thank you Steve, because of you, and your great inventions, I was able to have one of the best trips of my whole life, I'm pretty sure that without my iPod I wouldn't have been able to plan and enjoy everything the way I did. Rest in peace master, you are truly a hero! 
Steve, From Apple II to now iPhone 4, iPad 2, MacBook Pro, I have joined your journey all along. It is not easy to change the lives of people one time, but you had made this few times. You had changed the way people interact with computer (Macintosh with GUI and mouse), typing on Notebook (Palm rest on PowerBook), making graphic, books, posters, etc (desktop publishing), listening to music (iPod and iTunes), communicating &amp; interacting with phone (iPhone with multi-touch), reading books and web surfing (iPad), enjoying animation (Pixar)....... You are such a great person and visionary in this era.  We will miss you.  Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
I don't know how express myself right in this moment without feeling awkward, it's hard to express how much a person that I never met in person could mean so much not only to me, but for the world. I think that what I'm trying to say is that, he'll be missed, by me, by many Apple fans and more, of course, by his friends and family. My condolences to Steve's family and friends. And be sure that he'll be remembered forever as a visionary that changed our world.  Stay hungry, stay foolish. 
Thanks for making my life so much better and easier !!
I am enjoying the Apple and my iPhone and they make my life so much  easier...I am a single mother and when I say they made my life easier, I  mean it. RIP I hope that everyone will respect your genius and  vision...so very sad someone so useful has passed...&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was just a generally cool guy even though he wasn't the sharpest  dressed or the most socially appealing he was truly a very smart man and a  genius. - R.I.P Steve 
Thank you for following your dream! It has made it easier for us to   follow ours. Rest in Peace.
It so sad and hard to acknowledge the loss of a great role model, a huge  inspiration, a person who became the embodiment of art. The art of love  to his life, his job and his family. My heartfelt condolences to each and everyone who has Steve in their  hearts 
I got my 128k Mac in June of 1984.  Made my first spreadsheet that afternoon (Multiplan!).  The combination of ui and hardware sold me from the first.  Making micro computing real for the many is a sterling legacy for Apple &amp; Steve Jobs.
Steve Jobs was the most innovative human being who has ever lived. We  will miss you Steve. You are in a better place. From the first ever  mouse to the iPhone 4S. It's amazing how far we've come because of you  Steve. Your name will be known for hundreds and thousands of years. Be  sure of that. R.I.P Steve. 1955-2011 
My thought and prayers are with Steve's family and friends. I know he  will greatly be missed all over the world. Apple was blessed to have  sure a genius to be onboard.
Thanks ! Just thanks !
Dear Steve, maybe too far to be anywhere near your genius - you left your best in our every day life... I love your dedication to quality and improvement in my ordinary life... Never failed to love my MacBook and never will...&nbsp;
I am very sad that he is no longer able to appreciate the result of his  hard work and drive to build products that enhance our live. As a user  of his products I appreciate him and what he has accomplished. I will  miss his presence and genius.&nbsp;
I just want to say that He will always be Steve Jobs. 
It's such a sad day for friends and fans of apple everywhere. I have  been an Apple fan since my first iPod (iPod mini), through my MacBook  and my first iPhone (first generation). I have been lucky enough to  watch Apples products grow through the genius of Steve Jobs. Many  people's lives were changed so much by a man most of us never met. My  condolences go out to Steve's family and everyone at Apple. I am  confident that apple will continue in Steve's honor and will make him  proud.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a great inspiration to technology, my sincerest  condolences - he will live forever through Apple. May his dear departed  soul rest in peace.
RIP Steve Jobs. The Apple world will never be the same ever again :(
Here’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. 
Steve Jobs has changed our lives in many ways. His legacy lives on in the coming days... &nbsp;
I'm very sorry for such an enormous Loss Steve Jobs was responsible for making one of my biggest dreams come  true, the dream of being different, the dream of thinking different, the  dream of acting the way I felt, and Apple taught me, that it is not what  people have the most that is best. Steve created a family where  everyone could just fit in, be happy, and live an original life. Such  things I will never forget. Thank you Steve, You couldn't have done it  better. :) 
R.I.P Steve !! you re the best 4 ever ! you ll never be forgotten. 
Steve Jobs will stay here in my hands! Incredible! The information of everything in the internet acessed by my iPhone. Until the death of this genius came to me by this amazing invention! Jobs is alive because the world is more connected then ever!! He achieved the eternity!&nbsp;
Thank you for giving the world a better description of a "computer".  The future world is thankful to you for this milestone.  At least I am, for the first day I used an Mac almost 15 years ago.
Steve Jobs has shown me that if you do good work and have a vision, you can make your dreams come true. He was a true entrepreneur, inventor, mentor, etc. We will never forget all he has done and he has earned his place as one of the greatest human beings of all time. Thank you for sharing all of your wonderful Apple inventions with us over years, you will never be forgotten. "Steve Jobs is the Spirit of the Apple Co."  RIP Steve Jobs  It would have been an honor to have meet him.&nbsp;
     First of all, I would like to pass my condolences to his family and children.      Secondly, I would like to thank him for his contributions which he directly and indirectly brought about. I may not agreed with him 100% (or even 50%) of the time but I fully supported and admired his strive for perfection and excellence. It showed in the early days of Apple when Steve2 were at the helm. It showed in NeXT which I absolutely loved working with. It shows in Pixar which his vision really brought to life (although George Lucas started it I believe). And finally it showed in Apple again when he took the helm back in '97. I'm very thankful he did have a single mindedness about these things and I'm glad he stuck to his guns. I'm very sorry though that he left so early. Not because I believe all of these things will go to waste, only that I believe he should have had much more time to enjoy the fruits of his labor with his family and friends outside of being the "Steve Jobs" we all saw in public.      Again, my condolences to his family and friends and thank you to them and him for everything they have all given to us.&nbsp;
Dear Apple team, Just heard... Steve Jobs was someone I always admired and dreamed to meet him in person one day.... He was someone that comes to the world of humanity once in a century.... I am so sad for this irreplaceable loss... but I am confident he will find peace wherever he is now...
I cant believe it. He was only 56. We have lost a great mind in the industry and the world.&nbsp;
Thank-you, Steve.  You were and will continue to be the greatest hero and inspiration to my son and so many other wonderful, creative, passionate young people in whose hearts your legacy will live on.  We love you.&nbsp;
After hearing of Steve's death and looking around the room, I see my imac, macbook pro, ipad, iphone and scattered attachments and boxes to all of them in my office. I realize and smile, "this man will never be forgotten". He has made my life and everyone else who loves music, education, games, design and creativity on a technological scale's life so much more enjoyable, care free and aesthetically pleasing. A true genius and creative wizard. I only wish I had one ounce the drive and determination it takes to accomplish what he has.&nbsp;
My sympathies and condolences to Steve Jobs family on a very sad day.  Our world has lost an exceptional member of our human family.
It is really sad to loose someone as wonderful and intelligent as mr. Steve Jobs. He was and still remains a life example to a lot of us human beings. This is a black day in history of apple and will be remembered as the day the father of technology as we know it left this world. He leaves a big responsibility to all of us and I hope we can take it and make him proud. I am sure that the people he left in charge are really capable  to keep the company on that height it already is and always has been. There is nothing more to say. R.I.P. Steve Jobs you have left us a grate gift and we thank you every day. With the biggest of respects.
Have a good sleep!I'll remember you and your contribution to the IT industry!Love you forever!!! 
Thanks for all of these wonderful products Mr. Jobs. I will forever be glad to purchase Apple products. 
As a high school student that is CompTIA A+ certified and an ACA OS X  10.6 integration certified technician, I was saddened today to hear of  the loss of Mr. Jobs. In all of the time I have spent around technology,  no company has been as influential in my opinion as Apple has. As many  know, Apple's survival past the turn of the century, and subsequent  major releases (i.e. iPod and iPhone) were largely attributed to the  work of Mr. Jobs. I think I speak for many people when I say that he  will be missed.
         Mr. Jobs was an amazing inspiration to millions of people, including myself. As an artist I marveled at the beautiful care and craft that Steve demanded from all his products. His candor and precision spoke to all of us who aspire to follow our hearts and dreams and refuse to stop creating. While he will be sincerely missed, Steve will always be present in the global community he created and his numerous innovations that changed the way we all live. Thank you Steve for not just creating beautiful tools but for helping create a beautiful new generation.&nbsp;
You has always been my mentor of my life. I have learnt a lot from you. Hope you rest in peace in heaven.&nbsp;
Thank You Steve, Very Much!  Mac is My powerful and reliable tool, forever.  I remember you, forever!!
Steve Jobs is the inspiration of many people from different parts of the world. My most sincerely  condolences to the family an the Apple Company in my name and all the Cubans. He might leave this world, but his ideas and vision will always remain.
Dearest Steve &amp; Apple,  Thank you Steve.  Thank you for unlocking our imaginations. Thank you for your   entrepreneurial spirit. You went beyond what a product usually does.   All of what you've done, has changed the World for the better. Life is   more poignant, fulfilling, and interactive. I am so Sad to hear of   your passing. A bright light has dimmed for every person you touched.   But I am glad your years of suffering have ended. You were an   incredible man. Among the likes of Walt Disney, Thomas Edision, and   Henry Ford. The integration of technology and the human spirit is   Earth shattering.  So every-time an I-Anything is used you will be remembered as the man   that created a bridge from the ice age to a paradise of possibilities.  You have changed me and my family's life.  Thank you again Steve.
Thank you Steve for all that you have achieved  
My deepest condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and close friends. The   world has lost a true visionary and innovator. His work however will   remain with all of us that appreciate his designs every time we use   any apple product. He will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
From the way I work -   to the fun I have working -   to the way I talk about my life, my work and my world  - Steve has influenced them all.    Thank you Steve Jobs.  My deepest sympathy to Steve's family, friends and co-workers.  His death leaves a hole in our universe.  He will be remembered.&nbsp;
Today we lost one of the greatest Pioneer's of all time.  Thank you, Steve for all of the amazing products and joy that you have brought to my life over the last 18 years that I have been a die hard Apple fan.
Steve Jobs wasn't ONLY a visionary, leader, genius. He was the largest &amp; most-revered living global brand - loved regardless of class, color, race, political thoughts. His name shall remain FOREVER like Henry Ford, John Rockfeller, Walt Disney, Sam Walton who changed the world !! RIP, Steve Jobs. You'll always be remembered 
rest in peace steve jobs you have changed the world  --  bye )&nbsp;
I remember the very first time I saw toy story it changed my life. I had never seen such technology before and that was thanks to steve. then the kpod came along and I thinl I speak for anyone who owns an apple product our lives changed forever. I could not imagine my life without my ipod or iphone. thank you so much steve for sharing your innovations with us. You have made such an impact on the world that will have a life long effect. You will forever be in our hearts or our ears for that matter through our ipods or iphone. You will be truly missed.
Today our world has lost one son one scientific one friend a  visionary . He  never stop of work in his dreams .  I will remember you every time I see an apple logo .
thanks to you, i am who i am, i will make you proud. 
I have no words to describe the size of the sadness I felt when I learned of the death of the brilliant Steve. I'm a fan of Apple, always will be. May his soul may rest in peace. Thanks for everything.
  You cannot replace Steve. His mark on all of us from the Apple II in the seventies to the iMac I use today are the most useful systems of their times. Reading Steve's book, "The Journey is the reward", Steve lived a journey that very few men can match through all the ages!  We will miss your creativity. 
Dear Apple,       Steve Jobs will be missed by everyone, he re-defined technology  and was my inspiration for what I do now, it's sad for the whole world to  lose a person as important as him to technology today. Though I have  never met Steve Jobs or had a chance to get to know him, i would just  like to say that he will forever be remembered by me, I have stuck with  Apple products since about 2004, and I saw how the company rose and  produced great things, which would never have been possible without  Steve Jobs. RIP Steve Jobs, you will never be forgotten.
So saddend to hear of Steve, a battle he could not win, but in his life he has become part of the history  of the world and gained many friends .  Myself, I was one of the very first people in Great Britain to use  Apple 1, in those days not even a manual or a teacher, but after two weeks no problem, I was showing  everyone else at Heinz UK what a fantastic machine it was.  So thank you Steve.&nbsp;
It's like I have lost my role model. I have been grown up reading about his life and his struggles. It has always been my Inpiration to follow his thoughts. "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish". He was a great man, a great master mind, a genius ever born on this planet.  May His Soul Sleep in peace. Amen. 
An amazing human, a creative genius and a true hallmark of what America is and can be.  I personally gained much, both monetarily and creatively from the creations of Mr. Jobs.  I purchased stock in his company which gained me much monetarily, I created albums of music on my Macbook which gave me satisfaction and pride in my own creativity, my children now love Pixar films.  It's hard to express my feelings and gratitude to someone whom I had never or would ever have met.  As tears stream as I appreciatively remember what he has given to all of us, I personally have been touched by his creations and they have improved my life immeasurably.  A truly great person is one in a billion, and that is Steve Jobs.  Thank you Steve, your imprint on this world will never be eclipsed.
I am really sad to hear of the passing of Steve Jobs. &nbsp;It is amazing the gifts that his innovation and his ability to create, dream and lead such an amazing company have given us.   I marvelled just the other day how amazing it is that my 1 year old daughter thinks of an iphone as just a regular phone. How amazing that she will never know the rotary type phone that I grew up with 30 years ago but this amazing device full of colour, technology, intelligence, speed and more. To her this excellence is normal and that is ultimately thanks to a man named Steve Jobs.   You have changed the world for the better. Thank you.  My thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.   The world truly says good bye to a hero.
take care~   god wants to use the iphone:)&nbsp;
I just wanted to say that I will always remember Steve. He was such a creative genius and perfected the computer, smartphone, and tablet. I love Apple products and always will. Steve helped build a terrific company, that will last for many years to come.
Thanks for came to this world and be Steve Jobs...
Thank you for being a positive, visionary, and innovative influence in  my life.  I will do my best to follow your example of excepting only the  best of everything and never giving up at everything I do.  Thank you  for changing the world through Apple.  Thank you for saving Pixar.  You  will be missed, and I am honored to have known about you. One More Thing...        You were the Best.
Dear Steve,  You have made the world really better. With Mac's, iPod's, iPhone's and of course the iPad's. And Pixar. I hope you are well wherever you are now. My best wishes go to your family and your friends. Please excuse my bad English, I am a native German speaker. And in moments &nbsp;ike this... :(  Rest in peace! We will all miss you! My thoughts are with your family and friends!
An amazing human being and truly one of the most inspirational individuals of our time. Thank you for your beautiful mind and magnificent contributions to our culture.
It is real simple. Those of us who could not get our music "pushed out" to the world found a friend with Steve. Those of us who were just sick and tired of computers that crashed and existed in a different reality, Steve gave us hope. Those of us who knew that communication would change as we knew it, knew that Steve would provide a vibrant path to the future.   True visionaries come in all forms; however, Steve's vision resonated with a whole community of people who knew the world could be better, if that is what the world really wanted.  God's Speed!
Thank You for your contribution to the world!...Condolences to your friends and family-for your loss, they are in our hearts.
I am so sad to loose a beautiful mind in a teenager outgoing look. He connected me again with Apple years ago with brilliant new  technologies mixed with a young, fresh and very appealing features. I am going to miss his incredible personality. Humble person...with genius
Steve, thanks for dreaming up products that allow us, even for a minute, to escape to a better place.   R.I.P.
My thoughts are with Steve's family and friends. The world has indeed  lost an amazing human being.
My condolences go out to Steve himself, his family, friends, coworkers,  and all the others who have been impacted by him in one way or another.   He literally revolutionized the world.  Being born in the early 90's I  have grown up with all types of computers / cd players / and  entertainment devices that today do not even compare to the pure genius  of Apple's products.  His brilliance in such a renowned company has  changed the lives of everyone!  Such a powerful man will never, ever be  forgotten. Life began with an apple and for Steve Jobs, he can lay to rest knowing  he gave LIFE to "Apple"  Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs .. You are in my thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;
Dear Steve, We will miss you.  Rest in peace. &nbsp;My sincere condolences to the entire family. &nbsp;Steve you have touched us and made a better world for us all to live in.  You will be missed.
I'VE NEVER MET STEVE, WE'VE NEVER SPOKEN.  YET I SIT HERE TONIGHT  WONDERING HOW A MAN I NEVER MET HAS TOUCHED ME SO DEEPLY. MY CONDOLENCES TO STEVES FAMILY AT HOME AND AT APPLE.
Dear Jobs family and Apple,  Although I have never met Mr. Jobs, his vision, sense of style and presence with everything he touched is one of his greatest gifts to the world.  I feel that his legacy will not only continue to inspire the world but push others to think without boundaries and not to accept just a plain way of thin king. I will not forget what he has done for technology, humanity, entertainment and the world. He developed a culture and we are only at the beginning of what he has shared with us thus far. Mr. Jobs is Apple and I thank him for the products I use everyday.  All my very best wishes and thoughts go out to the Jobs family and to all of  Apple.
Steve Jobs - You stand for what is beautiful about this country, where visionaries can become legends. You are a symbol of capitalism in its greatest form. You changed the world as we know it. We will miss you. 
Sorry about your loss. Steve Jobs meant a lot to me. I always wanted to meet him. I hope that Apple will continue to live on to his expectations.  I always put it off writing Steve a short e-mail about this story.  Steve changed my life when he came out with the iPhone 3GS.  I was able to have in the palm of my hand a device that read to me test questions and answers for a standardized test. I also had it read the manual I was suppose to be familiar with. I never do well on standardized tests. On this particular test I got a 97%. This changed my life forever. It gave me so much courage in life that I can finally do well on tests. This sounds small, but it was HUGE for me. It gave me a boost in my career at the right time.  I will miss Steve Jobs inspiration.  All of his statements make me think whenever I work.  Thanks Steve. 
  <http://g1.globo.com/tecnologia/noticia/2011/10/morre-steve-jobs-fundador-da -apple.html=""> Steve Jobs     You are irreplaceable. God be with you.</http://g1.globo.com/tecnologia/noticia/2011/10/morre-steve-jobs-fundador-da>
Rest In Peace Steve.  Your products and more importantly, your  Leadership changed my life forever.  You and your family are in my  thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;
It seems like only yesterday that I was playing with my Apple ][ for  hours on  end and the rest is what has developed into a lifetime! I have  been truly blessed as you were to have the opportunity to love what I  do.  It is said that the man who loves his job never works a day in his  life... thanks to you, that's the story of my life!  The opportunity  that Apple created for me defies description.   I've been in this since  1977 and professionally since 1982 and I've had you influencing me the  whole way.  I'm grateful for your legacy and I'll continue to be driven  by the spirit of your endless innovation and curiosity for that "one  more thing".  Thank you so much for being willing to live, to share your mind, your  heart and your time.  My prayers and thoughts are with your family and I  pray God's blessing upon them.
I am so sorry to hear of the news- Also, the world lost a visionary. His work was truly amazing. RIP
Mr Jobs, Thank You ever so much  for your care of our beloved Apple. We all are better for having you in our world. God Bless and  our sincerest condolences to your family.&nbsp;
Our condolences go to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.  His vision has changed the world and his memory and inspiration will always be in our hearts.  He will be in our prayers.
Never forget ...!! Rest in peace. Written from one of his great inventions, the iPhone. :-(&nbsp;
 The world is only blessed by a few great men the touch the lives of everyone, Steve was the very best of those men.   His creations and dreams have touched us all in no small way. We have all lost a friend today.
 My life has changed for the better because of Steve Jobs.  RIP Steve....and thank you.
对于史蒂夫・乔布斯的离去，我深切哀悼，希望苹果可以使用“没有史蒂夫乔布斯时代”，创造另一个辉煌的奇迹！成就新的未来! - Apple supporters！ -苹果的支持者！
He will be remembered for his vision and for creating an era of amazing dev ices with incomparable technology.  Such a sad moment knowing we have lost  such a genius mind.
My thoughts and prayers are with Steve Jobs and his family. 
Truly terrible news about Steve Jobs passing away. I realize that I never knew him but the truth is that his products, he and his team created, have given me all the amazing opportunities in my life. They allowed me to express myself and my creativity along with millions of others. You will be missed Mr. Jobs!&nbsp;
Steve,  Thank you for your contributions to the world.  Apple has had a profound effect on my life.  I learned to read on my parents first Apple IIe back in 1980.  I played Zork and I wrote every term paper through high school and college on my trust Macintoshes.  I watched my mother write 4 books in the 1980's on our Apple computers and publish a magazine in the 1990s from the basement of our house on our old Centris.  Apple transformed my life, thank you for giving us these wonderful tools and may you forever rest in peace.&nbsp;
I can't wait to witness the beauty he creates in Heaven!  
The Thomas Edison of our era. One of most influential persons of 50 last years. Thank you Steve for your great job.  
Dear Steve, Thank you to help us to be able to have conversation with the world . I hope you rest in peace.  
 You've created the best user experiences ever. The way/style of your presentation was remarkable. I/We will always remember you Steve...             
I am so sorry for your loss. Steve was on my list of people to meet... He just seemed like a creative, innovative and open genius. His developments will be marveled at and adored for years to come.  What a hero. 
My condolences to Steve's family and the talented team at Apple,  With such a sad day as today, it is also a time to remember the inspiring impact that Steve has had on all our lives, personally and professionally. From the days of our youth, in the dawn of personal electronic technology, a mark was made which forged in our minds the possibilities of what personal sacrifice and commitment ultimately creates for others.  May Apple continue to make those marks in the minds of all and the spirit of Steve's vision bring consolation to our world.
I find it pretty amazing that I feel this way about a person I never knew. I lost my father in 2005 and haven't felt like this since. Everything I do in my professional career, most of the  gadgets I truly enjoy on an every day basis, everything I admire about a business, about creativity, confidence and passion leads me to Steve Jobs.  You made THE impact in my life. One that I am fully aware of and will cherish for the time being.   Think Different!!!&nbsp;
Since my first Apple IIe in the 80's, until my macbook pro, iMac and 2 iPhones -- he has inspired me with the success of one of the greatest minds in American business and I will always hold onto my Apple stock, passing it on to my kids someday.  Steve will be missed.&nbsp;
Our hearts go out to his family, friends, team members.  The inspiration that he emulated will be felt throughout the world for years to come.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve. 
Steve jobs was born the year another genius died, Einstein. His genius will be missed but hopefully the torch has passed on another genius&nbsp;
 As a graphic designer and owner of an advertising agency, I can honestly say I would not be who, where or what I am today if it weren't for the imagination, courage and fortitude of Steve Jobs. Thank you Steve, your physical presence may be gone, but your soul lives on.&nbsp;
My prayers and condolences go out to Mr. Jobs Family and his family in  Apple Headquarters, I fell in love with all his products and I wish I would  have met him to shake his hand and express myself and tell him how much I love the products. R.I.P Steve Jobs you are and will always be the face of Apple.
 To the family of Steve Jobs,  My sincerest condolences to the entire Job's family. I never had a chance to meet Steve or work with him, but it was always something I wish I could have done. Words can not express what you have lost today nor can words help ease the pain. Take solace in knowing Steve is in a better place and he will always be with you.&nbsp;
STEVE JOBS ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE TECHNOLOGY was immeasurable, MAYBE IS THE  LEONARDO DA VINCI'S THE XXI CENTURY, THE APPLE LOGOSHOULD BE FROM NOW BLACK  IN HIS HONOR. SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH. <br>
We lost a great guy who did an outstanding job to revolutionize the entire IT user experience. Rest in Peace!!! We will surely miss you.
RIP Mr Jobs You will be missed. Your products changed the world and changed my life. I thank you so much for everything. You will be remembered. One day I hope to work for your company. I need to become as focused as you. I hope your wisdom rubs off on me.
I don't know if this e-mail will be read sometime. Anyway, i would like to thank you Steve Jobs to make me a IT professional. I heard many things about you in university, some things was good, some was bad. I don't care of the bad things, I just use my memory in the good stuff. The best thing I remember is the color of the iMac. When I saw this kind of computer i was thinking "my God, this is the way I want to live, this is the way I want to follow". A few years earlier at Stanford in 2005 I already know the key of the success is follow my heart, and I was doing this in january 2005 when I go to university. Your words at Stanford make sense to me, I have sure of my road of life. Probably this email will not be read, but, wherever you are, you're reading this, and I would to like to thank you for make me choose the right way, for make me listen my heart. Thanks man.&nbsp;
I don't know why I am crying over of the death if a man I never met. But yet in a way I have known him most of my life. One of my first jobs I came upon an Apple computer and never looked back. Self taught Mac enthusiast I have only owned a Mac and will always and so will  my children. An Apple snob and so very proud to be! The iPod allowed me to bring music with me easily into any aspect of my life. I can carry my whole lifetime of music in my pocket and conjure the perfec t song for whatever mood or memory I need. My life is like a musical as there is always time and place for a song. Pixar brought the love of animation to my family and built the foundation of  a magical childhood for my children and family. It brought comfort to my father who was dying from cancer who wanted to watch Toy Story with his grandchildren because it made him happy. The IPhone is mans best friend. The IPad is the most amazing Christmas gifts I ever received and is the last  thing I look at every night as I say goodnight to the world. So now I do understand why I am crying for the loss of Steve Jobs. One can only imagine what more you had to give to our world. It certainly will never be the same. Xoxo&nbsp;
One of the greatest inventors, the best there was is no more. Our condolences to the apple family.  Steve you were the best.
So sad to hear of the passing of Steve Jobs. His amazing creativity and innovation is unmatched. The world is a better place because he lived in it. Rest in peace, Steve.&nbsp;
The Heaven wins a genius. Thanks Steve Jobs&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs. Thank you for making my world better. Thank you for changing the world of computing. Thank you for making the first computer I ever used and many since then. And, finally thank you for so many great memories. You will be greatly missed. My deepest condolences go out to the Jobs family and all of Apple. My thoughts and prayers are with you all.&nbsp;
It's true the world have lost today an amazing human being, but death is something weird, 'cause it is a mystery what comes after it, I belive that now Steve will be able to have peace, because his mission is done here and he left for humanity an amazing future. I am happy that I was able to see with  my own eyes the revolutions that Steve Jobs brought to this world, because without him the future would not be the same. Rest in peace Steve, we all love you 
My deepest condolences to my favorite inventor and visionary. It has really been a shock to hear this sad news but then we all know he's in a much better place. One can only preserve his memory by continuing to enjoy the fruits of his amazing labor.
In memory of his passing why not name the new iphone the iphone Jobs. RIP mate from a loyal apple fan.
My condolences to Steve Jobs and family. He was a great inspiration for designers and creative people. I am a graphic designer and I grew up using&nbsp;iBooks, iMacs, iPods...all Apple products. Rest in peace.
 Mr. Steven Jobs was the greatest contributor to the world in our time.  Whether it was to communicate, educate or entertain, Steve brought the technology to us and we are all so better off for it. He was the genius of our times. My deepest condolences to his Company and his family.
I was heartbroken by this sad news, goodbye Steve.
 I can't say much about Mr. Jobs being that I didn't know him  personally, but I do know that he certainly has influenced most homes in  America, this email goes to those who did know him, and on behalf of the  rest of us, please realize how blessed you were to know him.
He alone, has shown that a man with a dream that can all change the world. a  life without my iPhone I could not imagine... Rest in Peace, Steve. 
Steve Jobs (1955-2011) My thoughts are that Steve passed a true generation of technology and it was  sad that I found out he died today. I'll never forget the time the first computer he made was made in his garage  with 3 other friends. October 5, 2011. A day I'll never forget. &nbsp;
Yes I am an Apple fan, but that's because I believed in the vision that Apple had and still has! I understand that the company was shaped, moulded and inspired by Steve's foresight and amazing belief that technology can move people, help people and change the world for the better. Steve will go down in history with greats such as Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell and Walt Disney!!! From this loyal Apple fan, Thank You Steve for the great joy you have brought to my life and your vision will forever live on. Oh and one more thing Steve, Rest in Peace.
This is the most shocking news i've ever heard in my life. I can't  believe he just died like this. I have Apple for pretty much every  electrons of mine. Steve Jobs has been like a god for me. It's so sad he  left the world like this. R.I.P. 
I never have chance to buy some of your wonderful product, but for me, you change the way in my perspective of life. You are one of the kind. The world will not be the same without you! Good bye Steve...
i personally think Steve was one of the most brilliant men ever ... I, apple, and many more ppl will miss him and his ideas very much .. RIP Mr. Jobs  
Can't believe Steve is gone. So profoundly sad for the entire world. I find myself literally in tears of sadness over this incredible person that I never met but somehow always thought of as a friend and ally. He changed the world for the better more than anyone else I can think of. A true visionary, hero, and legend to me. I can only hope his vision of the future and spirit of innovation live on. I can honestly say that I am personally a better person because of Steve Jobs. My life will continue to be influenced by him until the day I die. He will be missed.
"I want to put a ding in the universe." -Steve Jobs  You sure did it. And you've completely changed mine. Thanks you Steve Jobs. Y ou are my idol.
....... your visionary genius has given the world so many gifts, inspiring people to follow your light and create wonderful expressions for themselves. What the world calls a caterpillar, God calls a butterfly - so fly away with love and gratitude Steve. Condolences to the Jobs family, you're in our thoughts and hearts.
Steve Jobs. You are my hero. Forever&nbsp;
A man with a vision, and the passion to follow it. He lived his life for others, and with all his success still managed to be a high quality individual. An inspiration that the world will miss. Steve Jobs, rest in peace.&nbsp;
As soon as I found out he had pancreatic cancer a few years back, I was immediately saddened, as my grandfather had the same thing and I know how hard it is to reverse.  I know that Apple will never be the same without his brilliance behind it all. May he rest in peace; he changed the world. Five times. P.S.: There's one more thing...    
Dear Steve,  Rest in peace Steve, I'm appreciate your development of Mac, I could make a life for myself as graphic designer with Mac.
Apple has always been a part of my life, since the first time I ever used a computer. I've always felt at home walking through an Apple store, and it reminds me of my parents, whose work depends to heavily on Apple computers.   That wouldn't be the case if it hadn't been for the amazing work of Mr. Jobs. His contributions to the way every one of us lives are priceless. His gift to the world is beyond that of which anyone else could dream of giving. His perseverance and leadership has been inspiring to us all.   I will miss you Steve Jobs and I hope forever that the company will stay alive and keep true to its name.  
Thanks Steve. Thank you for touching my life, making it more entertaining, more productive, more organized and more enriched. Thank you for providing the tools that provided me my career. Thank you.&nbsp;
<tawneemi@yahoo.com><steve@apple.com>I listen to Mr. Jobs 2005 Stanford University commencement speech about 2 weeks ago on YouTube. His words resonated in my soul.  "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I'm about to do today?" Those words encouraged me to embark on a journey of change. Pursue my ultimate goals!! Thank you!! Mr.Jobs legacy will live forever!! My condolences to his family. I'll eat an apple a day to remind me to live every day as if it were my last. I'll eat it in honor of Mr.Jobs, as a reminder to stay hungry and stay foolish! I'll eat it to honor a dynamic visionary!!&nbsp;</steve@apple.com></tawneemi@yahoo.com>
Steve was America......that good and great America we all believed in during our childhoods.  
      Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. You were a true inspiration to many of us. You taught us to never give up, and to always go beyond our best. Many may try to imitate you, but no one will ever duplicate you; you are one in a billion. You will be missed, Steve.              
I have always been impressed with Steve Jobs and have always said:  He is "The Man" &amp; He "is and will always be Apple"  Best wishes to his family and friends. <br>
3 Apple's change the world Adán, Newton  Steve Jobs. (1955-2011) Rest in Peace, the Genius is blocked. :( Slide to unlock and cry. :(
Today is a very sad day for all who benefited from the myriad of innovations Mr. Jobs contributed to the world.  The paradigms he created have forever changed the way everyman lives his life.  The world may not realize it yet, but we lost a very special person.  Rest In Peace Steve Jobs.  God Bless You and your family.&nbsp;
 Rest in peace Mister Jobs. Thank you for your humanity and your genius.   All my respect for your family  members and friends.            
It is with great sorrow that the world bids adieu to a visionary today. The world that he has creative through his genius will continue to inspire many young minds. He will live in our hearts and in our homes through his contributions. My condolences to all his loved ones. Rest in peace. &nbsp;
I can't believe this happened. He was an amazing man, working for the  good of mankind. He has created a company that will change this world  forever. May he rest in peace, and good luck to those who carry on in  his footsteps.  He will always be remembered as the father of Apple. We  wish you the best.
Steve jobs was not only a great inventor but an amazing person. He will be greatly missed but never forgotten because of the ways his products changed the world. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.
I was so happy when Steve came back to Apple, and even happier when they renewed their interest in the higher ed market.  When given the task in 2001 of renovating the language center at our university from its cassette deck system, I chose the new Mac OSX and iMacs for our lab.  I was the object of scorn from IT, but my faith in Steve and Apple bolstered me.  He and Apple went on to many more wonderful new ideas, systems, and "toys," always doing more and better than anyone else.  He leaves a legacy of a solid and forward-looking company at the forefront of the industry.  Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
How does the world replace someone like you? It doesn't. All we can do is cherish all that you have left us, which will extend well beyond the next product life cycle. The technology you pioneered and envisioned cut through the complexity and became embraceable, usable, and ultimately life-changing, for better or worse . I say 'worse' because I love some of your products so much that I sometimes get lost in them. You were simply that good. Thanks again for leaving an indelible imprint on my life and our world. You will not soon be forgotten, Steve. Your genius will live on and influence many generations to come. I for one am glad I got to 'know' you through your ingenious products that will forever change the way the world communicates and  educates. My deepest condolences to the Jobs family.&nbsp;
Dear Steve, I never met You. But I met people, who was fortunate enough to work with You. And, saddly, this is the closest I could get to You.&nbsp;Nevertheless,&nbsp;Your presence was (and&nbsp;still is) so big, that I felt&nbsp;You were everywhere and near to me. You changed the world! &nbsp; My condolences to the Family and Apple-Community.
thank you.&nbsp;you are a great inspiration.&nbsp;
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT... he was responsible for the revolution in  personal computing and his vision for the iphone has transformed  communications and mobil computing now and in the future.  Apple a  true  american icon.. thank you Steve.&nbsp;
It was with sadness that I received this shocking news: Steve Jobs passed away. He was a truly visionary. As I like to say, the technology's "Walt Disney"! Jobs DID really change our lives forever... I hope Apple continues to de velop his legacy...RIP JOBS. 
Steve, your live have changed my life. Thanks for being you. Rest in peace. 
Long, long time ago, I had the pleasure of attending a gathering where  Mr Jobs unveiled some of his then visionary insights in what is now  reality. I will never forget the experience of his magnificent  presentation skills, profound knowledge of technology, marketing talents  and in particular his realistic views of what technology can bring in  relation to the customer needs. He was definitely of a different league.
When you feel you're going to miss someone you never met, you know he must be someone different from the rest. Goodbye Steve Jobs. You'll be missed.
I'm sorry you had to suffer through this terrible illness of cancer. Thank you for doing what you did for the computer industry and making it what it is today.  God bless you and Your Family.  Rest in peace. 
Steve Jobs. The outlier.&nbsp;
To the world, and especially Steve's personal and corporate family:  We have all lost sheer brilliance, and a life embodied with an  inexorable drive to improve the lives of others.  For decades he has  astounded us, made all our lives better, easier, and more fun.  Pancreatic cancer has taken many folks in my family: my father, my  brother, my aunt, and now Steve, who just seemed like a distant cousin  that you took comfort in knowing would always be there. He never wrote  much, you found it hard to get in contact with him, but he was still  there when you needed him.  May he rest in eternal peace, and I hope he  can magically influence science from beyond to finally find the cure to  end this scourge that afflicts so many. Peace.&nbsp;
I am just really sad and touched by his death. I am 3 years older than he and  grew up in awe of his accomplishments from when he first started until now. He  must have been wonderful to know. I am never this touched by a 'celebrity's'  death.
I am deeply saddened by the loss of Steve Jobs. Steve had done so much for this world, and it is so unfortunate that he is gone. Words cannot express the sorrow that I am feeling right now. Everything I've accomplished in life so far is because of Steve. He was really an inspiration for me. He inspired me to start my own business when I was only 13, selling and repairing Apple products. That business has come a long way, and I am now the proud CEO of a Canadian Corporation. I really owe it all to you, Steve. I really wish I had gotten a chance in my life to meet you and really tell you how I feel. Im still just 15 years old, but I really hope that in the coming years I can expand my relationship with Apple, and get a job there. I am honoured to even have the slightest thing to do with Apple. The world has lost an amazing human being. I really mean it when I say that Steve was the biggest role model in my life, and no amount of tears or words can express how much he meant to me. Rest in Peace, Steve.&nbsp;
Remembering Steve...  Steve Jobs set in motion disruptive innovation that has touched the lives of many, many humans on the planet. He made a difference and will be missed!
That God be with him!
 Thank you very much, Steve. You have been one important source of inspiration and admiration for millions of people worldwide all these years. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thank you for the life of Steve Jobs. His vision, creativity and  courage. He has given us and continues to give us, unlimited hours of  immense pleasure and satisfaction due to the exemplary nature of Apple  products created under his stewardship. Our thoughts and prayers are  with his family, friends and colleagues.&nbsp;
My condolences and prayers are with you during this difficult time.   Steve Jobs was a great visionary and I hope that you will have peace in  knowing that his suffering is no more and that he will always live on in  spirit. To Steve,  You were a genius, a brilliant creator, and revolutionary.  You have  changed technology in a way that we would have never conceived.  You  have created many products that have shaped and changed the way we, as a  society, use technology in our lives. From the first Apple Macintosh  to the iPad and the iPod to the IPhone, you have created a challenge for  others and have excited the world with new innovative ways of  communication, design, and productivity. For all of this, I want to Thank you Steve!  Even though you have left  us and I know that you are in a much better place, you have left your  mark and influence on all of us, especially Apple fanatics like myself.
RIP Steve Jobs. You left your mark on our desks, on our ears and in our hands.
I am 12. Steve Jobs was my iLeader. I had soccer pictures today and that's when I found out he died. My stomach hurt the whole time and still hurt when I wrote this email. R.I.P. Steve Jobs. 
As you mourn the loss of Mr. Jobs, I mourn with you,. I never met him,  purchased few of his products, but stood in awe of him my adult life. I have always admired how he got the order then built the company.  Thank you for him. He lived a life of fullness and left a legacy that will position him amongst the giants of history.

I feel really sad, a man simply amazing and a incredible human!&nbsp;
I would like to offer my condolences to all Apple family for this lost.&nbsp;

He's been one of the pioneer of informatics technology, He's being retained in our mind forever in this way. Thanks Steve.&nbsp;
I never had the opportunity to meet Steve but I have always admired him. He was truly an amazing man and an innovative genius. He will be missed.&nbsp;
Fuiste una luz increible, me diste muchisimos momentos de felicidad gracias a los productos que creaste. siempre voy a sonreir cuando te recuerde.  Muchas Gracias&nbsp;
I have been using an apple since middle school (I am 39). My school was   a testing school for apple (Cincinnati Country Day) Apple has given me  so many opportunities, but in this down financial climate it has offered  me more then ever. A job. I have been an iPad designer since April. I  was laid off from a print design job in March. I had said over the last  2 weeks I should send Steve Jobs a thank you note for creating an  industry from nothing. I am sorry I did not do it sooner. Thank you  Steve.
Dear Steve Jobs,  For all you've done, for all you've been, for everything you've given  us, I thank you. Not only you have been a true inspiring figure and an example of success by your strength to follow your dreams and passions, and to never  let be taken away from you, but you've also changed who I am as a  person. I wish you would have had the opportunity to stay longer in this  beautiful world. Goodbye Steve. I love you.&nbsp;
I really don't know what to say. In my opinion Steve pretty much formed  80% of the 21st century. This man is the reason why I try hard in  school, and the reason why I aim high at what I want to be. He taught me  that you just have to believe that everything will work out. He taught  me many things. Thank you Steve. "Stay hungry, stay foolish" -Steve Jobs (RIP)  He'll be forever missed. 
I very very like jobs ,although he died,but i still like him!very much&nbsp;
I hope this world would be full of genius like you, Jobs.  Above all, you and your friends improved my life and my thought thoroughly.  My heart goes out to you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a great man for his time. I see him as a visionary. His  imagination and creativity that made apple what it is today. Steve Jobs  was a visionary and I hope that memory of him will live on through his  company, his friends, and his continuous effort. Thanks to him, I have a  wonderful computer which can do everything I need and want. "Im a Mac  and I want to thank Steve Jobs for helping me create my future." 
I'm so sorry. Steve was a great, amazing human on a world scale. Life goes on. Apple the best.&nbsp;
Thanks for leading such an amazing company.  Thanks for sharing your vision with the world through products I own and use every part of my day.  You will be written about, studied, copied, and analyzed for decades, if not centuries.  You are the top industrialist of my time and among the best of all time.  Thank you for sharing your life with us.  I look forward to reading your biography.  I wish the book had a better ending.  To Steve's family.  Thank you for sharing Steve with us.  He will be missed but never forgotten.  I'm sure that's an understatement for all of you.   
So extremely sad to lose such a brilliant man. His imagination and innovation have changed our world for the better. His impact on education is immeasurable. My prayers go out to his family and friends.
It doesn't compute.&nbsp;
 Hello,  I would you like to say just thank's  Steve .. you was a genius ... and all the world will miss you!!   We always will remember you  Thanks            
I only worked for Apple briefly, but it still feels like losing a relative.&nbsp;
 As a big fan of Apple products, Steve jobs will be missed by the public because of gadgets.&nbsp;
  Hi, I just wanted to express my sadness and condolences to Steve's family and friends on their and the world's loss today. Steve has had a big impact on many people's lives, and my iPad has helped me do so many things in everyday life, and his way of running his company and his close work in collaboration with the designers, the technicians and software designers just exemplified how well a business can be run with such a great rapport and respect between an employer and employee. Truly left many legacies behind. My most sincere condolences to the Jobs and Apple family.&nbsp;
Today is such a sad day. You were beloved by the world Steve, I hope you  knew you changed lives.
I'm deeply saddened by this news. Steve had an impact on us like no other person has. I am deeply sorry for your lose, but it feels like we have all lost somebody.  May god bless you all at Apple.
My wife and I extend out deepest condolences to the family of Steve   Jobs.  He will be dearly missed.     
dear steve： I 'm from china,got the news of Steve from the news,sorry for his leave My English is not well,i'm afraid can not express myself well in English ,so ,I have to write the left in chinese;   一个给全世界诠释人生的导师，一个富有激情的创业天才，一个朝死神微笑的大师，他的离开的确值得惋惜，可能，没有一个政界，军界，商界人士能够在这样享受着全世界的缅怀了，这种敬佩和怀念是人类对自我伟大的膜拜   他对我们的影响，不仅仅是手上的苹果手机和电脑，更是他倡导的激情人生，乐观人生和人类自我调整和平静坦然的伟大，怀念

My condolences, from the Dominican Republic. Steve jobs was the only  person who could save a company that was 90 days from bankrupt.
Thank you Steve. Your vision and passion is inspirational and through it you have changed the way we live our lives and changed our world for the better.  The world has truly lost an insanely great individual today. Thank you so much Steve, for everything. &nbsp;
Earth lost a true Jedi today.  I am deeply saddened at our collective loss  and grateful for all that he has given us.  My life and the lives of my family are certainly better because of the genius of Steve Jobs.  Thank you Steve.  The evolution of mankind has benefited by your existence.&nbsp;

 I'd like to send my condolences for Steve Jobs family and friends. As an Apple fan and user, I have many to thanks to everything Steve Jobs has created that enriches our lives. Apple is a tremendous phenomenon because of him and his magic team. He was the great genious of our days and will remain in our hearts!  Condolences.
Steve, When I was young, there were a little computers in China. But I knew there was an "Apple" and I knew you. Since that time, you have been  my idol. So I chose computer science as my major and wanted to be a man like you. Fortunately, I am a software engineer now and tracing your footprint. It's a grief time when you leave the earth. But your innovative spirit will been in our heart for ever.&nbsp;
Never has a man that I have never met, changed me so much. Out of college I became a certified Apple repair technician, which led   me into a world of computers and design, opened a world a photography.   I am sad that he is gone, happy that he was here.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your contributions to this world. You are a true   visionary. Rest in peace. 
Hi, This is from an inspired guy from new zealand. I am in deepest sadness in my life time. we miss you steve.
An extraordinary life indeed! May god bless and keep him, may the lord  give comfort to his family in these trying times. 
  My name is Cameron and I'm a 19 year old college student and for the past couple years, all I've wanted to do was be like Steve Jobs. He was cool, funny, and an extremely smart man. I look at Apple as one of the most successful companies in the world and when I graduate college, I plan to do everything I can to be apart of that organization. Even if it requires just working at a local retail store, I really look forward to it because working for Apple and being apart of the "Apple team" is my dream. The world has truely lost a genius and someone who has changed today's technology. I plan to buy an Iphone 4s on October 14th, and this will be more than a new phone. It will be the last product that Steve Jobs was around to help produce. My wishes go out to his familty and friends and I hope to become part of this AMAZING organization in my near future.            
 my condolences to the family of Mr. Steve Jobs, your remarkable works  will always be remember, will always be in our hearts, may you rest in  peace. 
My deepest condolecences are with Steve jobs' family, friends and his   admirers' whole community. We've lost so much today, but humanity has   won a so big heritage from his hands. We have to hold it proudly. God   bless him. Thank you Steve. A so profound admirer.
My Condolence for Steve, He true created Apple and transformed the company into the Apple the consumers know today. Thank you Steve for all of the Apple Gifts you gave.
Dear Friends: I have always been benefiting the creative and super-innovative of the work of the late Steve Jobs. The Apple product helps me finish the works and other assignments at works. I truly can say that Apple always avails to help. I wish to express my deepest condolence for the passing of Mr. Steve Jobs, the author of the modern and most friendly technology. I pray the family of Mr. Jobs be always in God's care and comfort. May Mr. Jobs rest in peace.&nbsp;
It Is Heartbreaking To Find Out That The Former CEO Of Apple Is Gone  Forever But In Our Heads And In History He Will Never Be Forgotten He  Will Be Remembered As The Guy Who Revolutionized The PC Industry I Say  Good Luck To Apple With Tim Cooks And Good Luck With The Future Products  Going To Be Created.
We will miss u in person but u r always in our thoughts, hearts and Apple products.
I am deeply saddened by the loss of a Steve Jobs. Apple and many of us have lost an icon, a genius, and simply a great human being. Our prayers and thoug hts go out to the Jobs Family and the entire Apple Family. Through the miracle of prayer, we will all get through it.
Dear Steve, You were unique in the technology industry. Thank you for your work and vision, has contributed greatly to the world with your example. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
As I sit here with tears rolling down my face, I am a retired 70 year   old grandmother that surfs the net, plays the games, all because of   Apple. I have the Mac mini, the original iphone and ipod. I can't live   or function without them. I am in touch with the world. Because it is so easy to maneuver and understand, I have everyone   fooled. My grandchildren and family think I am a whiz, but its not me,   its Apple. Mr. Jobs and his brilliant team has made it possible for anyone,   computer illiterate and all, to be a genius. We have lost two family members to pancreatic cancer and have followed   his pain. My sincere condolences to his family, we will miss him so.
Steve Jobs was a legend, he will be missed. This is a sad day.  I do find it apt that I found out about Steve's passing on my iPhone 4. Cheers.
Steve Jobs is the only individual from corporate America I tell my  children to emulate. Our country suffers without his innovative mind and  unique vision.&nbsp;
Steve has inspired me since I started to learn about computing. Steve is an idol for everyone who really knows about computers and technology, specially geeks, nerds and anyone who works with that stuff. Well, I confess, I am crying a lot, because I will miss him. Hope somebody reads this e-mail, doesn't matter how much it takes. He is my hero, and he will ever be my hero. Miss ya, Steve. See ya.             
I bought the first MacIntosh in 1984. I have purchased Apple products ever since. Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
I am so sorry.
Only he could have taken a company that was on the verge of going bankrupt and turned it to a 70Billion dollar company in just 15 years...what a loss to the world!&nbsp;
If there is one word that would epitomize Steve, it would be revolution.  He  has constantly advanced the frontiers of technology, and how the world now revolves around the products and the experience he has bequeathed us.  Long live Steve! Let us follow his lead! &nbsp;
We'll be missing you so much. Thank you Steve.
He will be sorely missed on this earth.  He was a great man with a great  mind.  My condolences to his family.&nbsp;
  Rest in peace, Steve. Thank you for making a better world for us!!!&nbsp;
Steve is an inspiration, for me, he made the humble computer easy and  fun again. What a visionary.&nbsp;
Steve,  You have no idea how deeply saddened I am today. To hear about your passing was like a dagger to my heart. You were truly my idol. I felt like I knew so much about you, though I had never met you at all. My goal after college is to get a job at Apple because of my passion I have for the company you created. You were my inspiration to work hard and to "think different" and I hope you are living peacefully in heaven 
"People who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do..." &nbsp;And you did it!!! &nbsp;Hungry, foolish, crazy, misfit and rebel dreams to you...<div><br></div><div>We'll miss you too much! &nbsp;See you on the (i)clouds!</div>
I remember my parents putting an Apple II computer in front of me in the late 70's. It expanded my world and gave me a bigger perspective for what was possible in my life.   Steve changed my world and changed the world in his short lifetime. God was so proud of his earthly accomplishments that he cut Steves time short for his own personal needs. Heaven is better off and we are all left here to tempotarily experience the void left by his passing. We now have the baton. God and Steve want us to carry on where they left off!&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for understanding what most of us dreamed of having for technology that works for us... we will miss you and thank you for all you accomplished in your short, productive, inspiring life. 
 Thank you Steve, for creating a revolution that changed the world we live in. You were an amazing person, and a true genius. My sincere condolences to friends and family, and may him rest in peace. All you've created will live on in our memories.&nbsp;
Rest in Peace!!  My condolences goes to his family.  An amazing innovator!! &nbsp;I remember my first computer It was an Apple II computer.  It was an  amazing computer.  Now, I have a Macbook Pro.  Again, thank you for inspiring me to get into the computer field!&nbsp;
Thank you for creating so many products that I love and use everyday.  I  own an iphone 4, ipad, and macbook and use each one every day.  Apple  literally changed my life.  Thank you so much for your vision.   
        Steve Jobs is and was an amazing man. There's no doubt about that.  As I sit here writing this email, I am saddened by the fact that I will never be able to meet this wonderful man.  From his dedication to his work, bright mind, and unique personality; I've always looked at him as one of those people you just want to be around.         My heart goes out to all of these people who's lives have been touched by Steve, and I hope you can look at the great legacy he has left behind and smile.  Smile because of how proud you are.  His life has inspired me, at only age thirteen to try to succeed at anything I do. So, R.I.P Steve Jobs.  You will never be forgotten. 
While Mr. Jobs' legacy will live into the future, it's his past that I remember so fondly when thinking of him. The Apple II, IIc, Macintosh and Lisa were some of the first computers I was ever able to touch. Without a significant other in college, his NeXT computer with it's CD ROM and NextOS operating system were my items of lust. Today, I've been fortunate enough to watch Steve's influence grow a tiny computer maker into what it is today (with the help of it's great employees). I feel fortunate to have witnessed the public output of much of Steve's life. Steve will be missed greatly, but, his influence will continue. 
         <meta http-equiv"content-type"="" content"text="" html;="" charsetiso-8859-15"="">           <font size"+1"=""><font face"arial"="">Dear Steve:<br>         <br>         I got in touch with Apple products accidentally when my wife had         wanted doing some shopping&nbsp;and I strolled into a nearby Apple retail shop where I got         fascinated by the great looking black&nbsp;MacBook. So on this particular day my spendings outperformed         those of my wife due to purchasing&nbsp;this notebook. From this day on, in winter 2007 I've been         addicted to Apple product and have&nbsp;been watching every Apple keynote what has been brought out. So         even I've never met you in person.&nbsp;I have become a big fan of how you presented Apple's         newest products. Your enthusiasm for the&nbsp;products and your identification with Apple and towards the         industry has always been great to see. It&nbsp;ever has been a pleasure witnessing your outstanding         performances on stage. So when the news of your death hit me tonight I feel like having lost a good friend. So         Steve, thank you for all the joy I have had during the&nbsp;last recent years. It was great noticing all the milestones you         have let Apple bring out. I hope that you will find&nbsp;a similar inspiring atmosphere you can live out your unique         creativity on the place you are now.<br><br>       </font></font>     
THANK YOU STEVE JOBS! You've opened the doors, eyes and minds of the World! R.I.P Our Dear Friend!
Dear friends,  I just want to express my condolences and appreciation for Steve.  His memory lives on through his accomplishments, heart, and strong work ethic.
I've been following Steve since I was a child in 1998. I would always make sure I was near a computer to read up on his Keynotes growing up. Wanting to work at Apple, his inspiration got me my degree in Computer Science from Cal Poly Pomona and be a proud employee at the Apple Store Victoria Gardens since 2006. &nbsp;Steve's death is truly heartbreaking and and my condolences go to all those who knew him personally. &nbsp;His footsteps are certainly those whose everyone should want to follow.
Hello im from Argentina and i heard a frase that was wonderful i will try to  translate it so that you understand :   "steve was a science fiction writer ,but instead of writing incredible things, he made them come true"  Thanks for your time.
Thank you Steve for your amazing vision of creating one of the most  creative and innovative companies on earth. As a graphic designer I began working on an Apple in the 80's and have  been a loyal Apple believer.  May you rest in peace, Steve. 
Steve was the under dog - who broke through and made it.  Creative genius and inspiration to me.  Few people shape the world and make it better - Steve has made it better.  Thanks Steve and enjoy your next life - try not to work so hard the next time around.    :)
Today we've lost the most visionary mind of our time. Steve transformed  every aspect of technology right from the very beginning. No one will ever be able to innovate the way Steve did, I don't care to  imagine what the world would be like without him.  Thank you for everything. 
Steve will be remembered always for his amazing work with the Mac   company. To die at 56 is to die too soon, and Steve will be with Macintosh   forever.&nbsp;
Una muestra de que el que tiene razón, tarde o temprano logra hacer que  los que lo rodean vean la genialidad de sus ideas.
Steve changed the way we live. I wish I could thank him for all of his ideas and the way he made me seeing and understanding the world. I'll always remember Steve Jobs as a hero! For the friends and family, my sincerest condolences and I wish he's in a better place.
A wonderful man with a wonderful imagination. Steve Jobs has changed the  world and will truly be missed even to those who did not know him, but  knew his products.

Today I'm felling more sadness than usual. I'm sending to you and all your family my  deppest fellings the world of technologies never more will be the same,thanks for making ours lives better.
Steve was one of my biggest heroes. His products were amazing and still are. His design genius and golden touch were absolutely one of a kind.  I will remember the "magic" of Steve Jobs for the rest of my days.... &nbsp;
We had lost an incredible and inspiring human being. We need to thank Steve for his innovation on all the Apple products he had helped created. His passing certainly saddened all of us. I lost my father last year and it's surely not easy for close family. My prayers are with Steve's family.&nbsp;
Since I've started working with computers. an Apple device lend me a   hand.  Now a days, and yet for so many years, I know it was Steve's hand.  We are so fortunate to share this help and knowledge, that in a moment   like this, I ask myself, should we frown or should we smile.  I think both.  Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
    Steve was a great man that changed the world of computing both worldwide and for me personally. His products have dominated my spaces. He was truly a unique visionary and will forever be missed.&nbsp;
Definitely Steve has been an inspiration, an one of my favorites most  admired persons. The world has lost a great &amp; a unique person. His thoughts and actions will be inspiring me... <br>
To his family i wish to send my condolences. I remember meeting Mr. Jobs Before and he was such a humble person and he's Influenced my business since in many ways. 
Thank you Steve Jobs for revolutionizing the way I work and play.&nbsp;
My thoughts and prayers for his family and may they know Steve was very  much loved and will be missed.
I might be an another billon one to send this condolence but i am not an  ordinary one. world has lost a revolutionary leader in the field of  technologies. I express my heartfull condolence , May his soul remains  in peace in heaven. God Bless Apple.
Steve,  You made it so easy for me to create and turn my ideas into reality. The device never got in the way. I would sometimes sit down and just create something...just because. That's what the Mac let me do!  Golf + Mac + Inspiration  my ability to turn my hobby into a business.  My sincere condolences to family, friends, and employees of Apple.  Keep it going!!!!!&nbsp;
May you rest in peace, thank you for all you have done for us! 
Steve was the most influential human in leading the technological revolution we have experienced. No one man has revolutionized such a multitude of industries. HIs vision and ability to wow the world will never be forgotten.  
 I am rendered speechless. He was a testimony that one voice can change the world. Thank you.&nbsp;
I have been blessed by Steve Jobs. His innovations have brought me hours  of joy, and have inspired me. Few people depart this world having made  it better on the scale that he did. I pray that his family find comfort  and peace in the fact that he has blessed countless others.&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs,  We all know that you are in a better place that anyone wishes to  be there. I never met you, but I've been one of your huge fans and  watching your speeches that you had during introducing a new product  from your invented company that is number one in the world. I will never  forget you, your great speech and of course your company that I always  confidentially purchase my needs from it.  Rest In Peace Steve Jobs, the man that apple's fan never forget  thanks for the email address.
My heart is broken.  How is it possible to love someone you have never met! I have not met him, but I know a part of him: I am typing this on my iPad, and I go to the gym with my iPod, and my computer station houses my  precious Mac Mini!  Thank you, thank you Steve for fulfilling your visionary  dreams.  Thank you!  In Him all things consist.
 It's because of you that so much has happened and even though you were far away, you've changed my own personal life with what you have envisioned and created for the world. You will be forever missed, R.I.P, and may god take care of you now.              
To the entire Apple Family - today you lost a great man and more importantly a great friend and colleague. May his legacy live on in your hearts forever.
Thank you Steve for making this world a better place many times over.&nbsp;
Hi Steve,     Thank you for the many great things you have given to us. Thank you for changing the way we live our lives. Thank you for opening our eyes to what can be achieved by sheer determination, dedication and discipline. You dedicated your whole life to create not only a cool gadget that rules the world, you created a trend, a culture and an inspiration for people who sets to be you. You might not rule the world with your riches but your legendary life will always be the immense wealth of motivation and inspiration for generations to come. We will always remember you as the world's most acute visionary, innovator and creator of the coolest and most efficient digital lifestyle in our era. Apple is Steve Jobs and Steve Jobs is always Apple. Rest In Peace. May you rest well in the arms of the Lord. Amen.&nbsp;
I am saddened by this news.  Steve, and Apple, have changed my life.  I "grew up" in the industry loving Microsoft, hating Apple… refusing to change, or to "think different".   One magical day my wife bought an iPhone and before we could drive the 5 miles to our home I turned around and bought one myself.    Since then my life has been more than just a stream of iPads, iPhones and Macs… but about challenging how I think and how I live.  Its not just about the hardware or the software.  Steve probably impacted my life as much as anyone has ever (outside my parents).  I hope that Apple will continue on the course that Steve has set.    Good luck to you all, and to Tim who has some huge shoes to fill.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your contribution to this world through your technologies.&nbsp; Your inventions have made my life so much easier.&nbsp; The world lost a great man today.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
He has always been such an inspiration to me and will be for the rest of my life. May God bless his soul. 
Steve Jobs was an amazing man and did amazing things. He lived a great   life and did many great things. Hopefully his visionary spirit   continues to inspire others to do amazing things. 
Steve Jobs now joins an elite list of historic inventors...  Edison,   Einstein, and Newton.&nbsp;
We will miss mr. Steve Jobs.    
Steve was an inspiration to so many including us that never met him personally but through his creations. The world is a more productive place through the time Steve has spent in it. That cannot be said about many.  You will be missed, rest in peace.
Thanks Steve.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Even for someone that did more than most with the life they were given,  yours was just too short.  I hope that Apple never forgets the fusion of great technology and  vestigial 60s Berkeley/Stanford liberal hippie values and respect for  the humanities you instilled during your tenure. Heartfelt sympathies to your loved ones, and your extended Apple family.&nbsp;</div>
My condolences go out to Steve Jobs Family and Friends!  My Brother passed away on April 8, 2011 from the “nature of the beast” of pancreatic cancer.  Although he was only diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on Jan. 3, 2011, we talked about how Steve Jobs was also fighting pancreatic cancer.  It gave Michael hope and determination in the fight.
Thank you Steve for taking the road less travelled. The one where you were willing to takes risks, and head towards the future. You were Lightyears ahead of us all. I hope we can all aspire to your greatness.  Thank you, and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Although I never knew Steve personally, his vision and creativity have certainly affected my life. From my 1st computer, an Apple 2E, to my current iMac, ipod, and Iphone products, have become so much a part of my life. No single human being has affected my work, schooling &amp; social life as he had.  His name will be immortalized with all the great innovators. What would the world have been without a Steve Jobs? He left us too soon, but God needed him more than we did. May he rest in peace....&nbsp;
I can never stop marveling at the beauty and the ingenuity of Apple products. The passing away of Mr Steve Jobs is a great loss to mankind. May his creativity and his spirit live forever!&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs. Your life defines what it means to be an American. Thank you for enriching my life.&nbsp;
A visionary, he changed the world. The life as we know it. He will be never forget. His dedication, his dreams.&nbsp;
I would like to thank you, Steve. Your words and wonderful products have a very positive influence to the world.
 My heartfelt condolences to the family.  And a warm thank you to Steve, a man who cared to always find out or remember what was important in his heart. A fine example. Bless you.&nbsp;
To Mr. Job's Family,  We are honored to be living under the glow of Steve Job's brilliant aura!&nbsp;
You have changed our world and we are thankful.  Rest in peace, fine man.

Steve was a great person and I hope that he rests in peace. I am a huge &nbsp;fan of Apple and this came as a shock. Hope all who knew Steve feel better soon and know that he is resting in peace! &nbsp;
I remember the day my Father brought home the Apple II computer. We were the first ones I knew to own a personal computer and were the  only ones for a number of years. I still use many of the skills I learned on that computer to this day. Thanks Steve for making it all happen!! 
I may not have known Steve Jobs personally, but I admired the man a great deal. He is the reason I went into computer sciences. He had a vision for the future of technology and did what ever it took to achieve that future. Truly a great person. I am very saddened by his passing. R.I.P. Steve Jobs.
Steve- you changed the world as we know it! Thank you for your amazing life.&nbsp;
Thank you for changing the world and inspiring all of us with wonderful products. You will be immensly missed.
Dear Mr. Jobs: I am deeply saddened by your silent but inevitable passing away.  To me, and to millions and posterity to come, you will always be a charismatic personality, a transforming entity and a pioneer who has forever changed the world with your innovations.  You are often compared to the likes of Thomas Edison, Einstein and many other pioneers.  However, to me, you are Steve Jobs who is equally on par with the aforementioned creators.  Your intangible presence will be echoed loud and crystal clear through your omnipresent creations and our changed lifestyle due to those creations and their emulated counterparts from many inspired by your unique visions and grasp on invincible perfection!!!! May your soul rest in peace, Mr. Jobs!!!!
Steve, you are truly an inspiration.  Your drive, your success, your  innovation despite your declining health.  You gave so much of yourself  and forever changed the technological world.  May you rest in paradise  with all those that we have lost too soon. 
Steve&nbsp;is one of the great mind ever to walk on this planet and We will miss him very dearly!! Our condolence to Apple family and friends and fans!! We are so proud of him for making humans make many small steps towards giant leap in Human Evolution!! Long live his memories.
To the Apple family,  Please accept my condolences on the loss of your leader, mentor, and most of  all, friend.  How fitting that I send it from my iPad...his family should be so proud of a man that had a vision and followed it to fruition.  Steve changed the world with products and his work and legacy will live on.&nbsp;
He will be remembered alongside Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell as one of the most important visionaries of the ages.
Thank you Mr. Jobs for contributing to what makes the USA excellent.   Your innovations inspire us all.  We will miss you terribly. 
Steve Jobs were truly a wizard among muggles!!!  He has a passionate that can inspiring a lot of people to do their work in the best way. Stay Foolish!!! A legendary words from him. Steve is not only change his own life but also change the world!!! Nowadays, maybe there are many motivators or inspiring peoples roam outside, but Steve is a uniquely one. I hope his spirit will stay in our minds and can be applied in our activities. Good Bye Steve!!! U're the Best One!!!
There are no better words to describe Steve Jobs than "True Genius".  Sure, he was no Einstein, and he didn't know everything about anything.  But he was a different kind of genius. His ability to conjure up new  products that inspired generations to do amazing things was a magical  skill, one that only he possessed. Steve Jobs was, is, and always will be a role model and inspiration to  me. I strive for success because of what he has accomplished. I live my  life with new philosophies and ways of thinking, thanks to Steve. My  love of filmmaking has grown immensely while using products like Mac  Pros and MacBook Pros. They have helped me so much to improve upon my  art of editing. Thank you, Steve Jobs. Thank you for everything you've done. From  creating products that are amazing, and even magical, to inspiring me to  think in new and exciting ways. Rest in peace, Steve. We will miss you.
  Enviado via iPad  God bless your family. My family love APPLE and you. The word is crying. We will never forget you.
Thanks, Steve!    You gave me my first computer (mac 128k in 11th grade) and I have never had anything other than an Apple.  Thanks for making using a computer so much fun.
Thanks Steve for creating the iPad. You have changed my daughters life. She was diagnose with autism spectrum disorder. She is communicating more because  of the great apps that are available. You will be remembered for the great things you have created. I hope your products will continue to changes lives.
All I want to say about Mr. Jobs is - " Thank you " .  Thank you for changing  the world in so many ways. My heart goes out to your family and entire staff at  Apple Inc..    I can only imagine what you are inventing in heaven with " HIM"..       Will the next device you  create be called  "i-heaven"?
Thanks...
* * You are an Iconic person,,, My deepest condolences to Jobs' family, his loved ones, his team at Apple and the rest of his fans. May you rest in peace Legendary Steve Jobs
 Steve Jobs was a incredible and gifted man who forever changed the world of technology forever. I will always remember him.
Today should be decreed mourning the death of Steve Jobs around the world.      Seven days with all the flags of all nations at half mast  !!!!   Brazil's condolences     
Just wanted to send my condolences and my thoughts go out to everyone. I  am shocked to hear the news of Steve's passing. He will always be  remembered to me as an inspiring individual, as I'm sure he will be to  many. We, humanity, indeed lost a larger than life individual.  Thank you Steve, for all you've done and your visions you've shared with  us. Despite all this, I feel we're still in pain.
Steve touched my life in so many ways. he taught me that it is ok to be the underdog. My family and I wish the best for his family and his family at Apple and Pixar. His legacy will live on forever.&nbsp;
 We have truly lost an amazing human being, a person who created a new era in advanced tech, who changed the world with his inventions, he really was the Leonardo da Vinci of our time.  I, a humble fan, only have one thing to say... Steve, you have been an amazing role model for me, someday I will also invent and share it with the world.  Rest in peace, you have truly made the world a better place...              
He was a great man. Very very sorry for the loss. 
Dear Apple,  I was deeply saddened to hear about the death of Steve Jobs. Even though  I am only 12 years old, apple products have already played a huge part  in my everyday life. I greatly admired Mr. Jobs for his creativity and  innovation and his ability to design products that people didn't even  know they wanted. I'm sure that the memory of Steve Jobs will live on  for generations to come.
My internet-life began when father buy "Performa5410".  I write e-mail by PC,the beginnig is Apple,Steve's product. thank you. Sleep in heavenly peace. You will be forever in my heart. <br>
  so sad - R.I.P. Steve and thank you so much ! you endowed the world with your great products - now it's time to bring some i to heaven ... bless you
 "In each one of us is a secret, an inviolable inner landscape with plains, valleys of silence and secret havens. "                                                                                                        Antoine de  Saint-Exupéry.               
 I was really hoping that Steve would out live us all. Although I never meet him, I am personally deeply touched by his passing. He was one of those people that was so inspiring and always gave me something to look forward to. Steve will be missed by more people than he could have imagined.&nbsp; 
 Please keep his vision of being the best, not the biggest. Because the best will make you the strongest.  My God bless all of you.    
RIP Steve!! you will be remembered forever for the great products and thinking. 
Steve brought an elegance and simplicity to technology that gave us, as  users,  a delightful experience. Rest in peace, Steve.&nbsp;
Beautiful man. Rest in Peace. You brought so much love to the world.&nbsp;
I'm truly saddened by the world's loss of a great innovator. My condolences go to your families at home, at Apple, and the many other places where you've shared your heart and genius.  Thank you for your vision, tenacity, and wisdom. You made technology sexy. &nbsp;Music accessible. &nbsp;Expanded the creative sense in all of us with your finely crafted tools. &nbsp;We will make this marble a better place with them. Hopefully we can live up to your dream with ours. &nbsp;Rest In Peace, Steve Jobs. Cheers to your genius.&nbsp;
Good Night. &nbsp;Today is a sad day for many fans of Steve Jobs and his creations, I am one of those people.  Steve Jobs was a genius and always will be.  My condolences.  Thank you.&nbsp;
..your vision, intuition, and courage to swim upstream has helped a lot  of people like me to realize so many of our dreams creatively and  professionally. So many of my best professional moments happened because  of the sophisticated processes Apple simplified with the Mac. May God  bless and comfort your family.
Steve, thanks for enthrall us with his genius light years ahead of our time and also to inspire usdaily in the pursuit of excellence in what you do! Long before and well beyond their iGadgets!Rest in peace and may his legacy and myth remains a source of inspiration for futuregenerations!  Family members and friends, who had the privilege of being above all the great inspirations of his sensibility, my condolences and respect.   Thank you for teach us to think different !
To the family and friends of Steve:  He was truly a genius and I am sending my sincerest sympathy to everyone who loved him and worked with him.  It was just too soon for him to go.
Steve inspired us to create this business, out of nothing... With hope, enthusiasm and inspiring ideas...  Without Mac we couldn't have made it.  Thank you Steve Jobs.   May he rest in peace...&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an innovator, a visionary and a totally cool guy. My prayers go out to his family. He will be missed.
Mrs Jobs,  May god give you strength during this difficult time.&nbsp; I am just one of the fan of Steve, thanks for his contribution to the whole  world.&nbsp;  Forever Jobs, we will always love you.
from the Apple II+ to my iphone today- I have loved Steve Job's products and company. Thank you for making great products and having your vision.  Rest in Peace, Steve.
Just want to express myself - sorrow regarding this sad day.... Steve has been always one of my heroes. I always will remember him as the genius he was... for the deep footstep he left on this world and the path that he started.  Rest in peace.... We will remember you always.   --&nbsp;
You are just a big and huge inspiration.  Thank you for everything you did and accomplish.  The world is better because of you and your team.
His contribution to the WORLD of computing and technology will never be  matched!  What an amazing accomplishment.  RIP!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is simplicity and magnificence. Steve Jobs is existence and purity. Steve Jobs is possibilities and people. Steve Jobs is not only an amazing human being, because not even the most amazing person could do and left what he did.  Rest in peace.  Maybe we will have a long time to have another genius to change this world.  Thank you Steve. Thank Apple.&nbsp;
I didn't know Steve Jobs personally of course, but the news of his death saddens me.   A great man is gone.  Apple products have always been special to me, as if I knew a secret few others did.  Yet, I have hope for the future.  Steve Jobs's legacy will live on in his employees and the product they create.  Computers as we know them wouldn't be the same without Steve Jobs. Thanks, Steve.  We owe you one.  Rest in peace.
Dear Apple,  I am so sorry to hear of Steve's passing. Thanks for revolutionising  computing and making it more accessible and enjoyable for everyone! I  shudder to think what could have been, if we did not have the creative  genius that is Steve. &nbsp;I will always cherish my Apple products, knowing that Steve had a part  to play in their creation.
The world is forever a different place... difficult to measure the impact of loss of such genius and vision. My condolences to family and friends&nbsp;
Today we mourn your loss, but without you this world would not be as it is.&nbsp; Your vision has inspired many and allowed countless people to communicate in a way that we never would have thought of.&nbsp;    To your family and co-workers, I am truly sorry for your loss.&nbsp; Words fail me right now.&nbsp; Godspeed to you and prayers.&nbsp;
 The World has lost "A Great Apple Man"- Steve Jobs Today !!! Steve left us at a very young age of 56.........The extraordinary man who built the world's  greatest technological corporation, the visionary,the leader, the genius, the source of inspiration for millions, the revolutionary, the creator of "I"  generation- iMac, iTunes, iPod, iPhone, ipad and the iCloud ,the man who made a history in Apple's success, the  creator of "Next" and the"Pixar.......the man who changed the Computer, Music and the Mobile Industry forever !!!!......."Steve " the world will remember you forever!!&nbsp;
Please accept my and my families heartfelt condolences and prayers for the jobs family. We are saddened by his passing and yet grateful to have had the opportunity to see his vision and creativity come to life in so many ways and the lives that he has touched through a variety philanthropic efforts.&nbsp;
He will always be remembered and missed. His products enriched and made  my life enjoyable.
Growing up watching Apple grow up the first time, was an amazing experience.  Most of my early work, indeed the technology that inspired my career, started on an Apple ][.  Yes, it was Apple's early product that inspired me to pursue a career in technology so many years ago.  I was there in the beginning… through the down times… and finally a full return to championing Apple technology shortly after the millennium.  Steve Jobs taught us so much about innovation, leadership and excellence.  No other business leader in the past decades mastered all three of those traits.  Apple 3.0 was Steve's greatest gift to us all.  Hopefully his DNA is so well embedded in Apple that it will continue to thrive and make the awesome products that we have all grown accustomed to in his memory.  Steve, you will be missed, but never forgotten.
I am so very sorry to hear about Steve Jobs' passing. &nbsp;I wish I would have known him. &nbsp;My thoughts are with those who loved him.&nbsp;
A great loss for many. Rest well Steve. You have inspired many creative people with your own creativity!&nbsp;
I love my iPhone and my macbook so much I just had to get the logo tattooed on my fingers, forever grateful for your work Steve! 
I've never met him or seen him, but he was a household name and through his genius a culture was born. It's not everyday someone achieves feats like that. He was an amazing person and a visionary. He will be missed by many. Rest in peace. You have left your seal on the world forever and have thus immortalized yourself forever as a timeless figure of what determination and hard work can achieve.
REST IN PEACE NOW YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GIVE GOD HIS APPLE STUFF :) 
This time what fell were more than Apples! Gravity pulled the whole tree, the God of Innovation &amp; Growth in grave times for Global economy. 
Simply the most inspiring, creative, business mind ever.  Blessings to his loved ones and The Apple Corp.   Part of my happy days is using any of my APPLE products.    
My prayers and thoughts are with the family, friends and colleagues of  Steve Jobs. His influence, creativity, drive, charisma and character  will never be forgotten. May Steve Rest in peace.&nbsp;
 Steve, you will always be in our heart, you inspire us to go forward in our careers, in our lifes, with your creativity. Rest in peace, you will always be alive...&nbsp;
I bought my first Mac in summer 1985 to write my first thesis and I've  been Macintoshing  ever since. The computing never gets in the way of  the creative writing, which I'm still doing all these years later. This  is the way Steve made it and I love that. I continue to love all my Apple products and subscribe to the Apple  culture of creativity without being limited by the tools. Thank you Steve. God bless.  
I am completely shocked about this. I am truly sorry for your loss... I have always admired Steve and the company he built for being so on edge and one step faster than everyone else... He will be truly missed. May he rest in peace.
I´m very sad. Goodbye.&nbsp;
Thanks for all the contributions you brought to people's lives. Your work will never be forgotten by people around the world. You had a dream and worked to transform it into reality.
RIP to an amazing innovator and human being. I am amazed at how many ways he  has made my life better through technology. Teaching in a classroom has bee n amazing with Apple products to enhance my delivery of curriculum.  Thank you, Mr. Jobs. My heart goes out to those who love and know you.&nbsp;
He was my leader, my inspiration. Death is not the end. It is only the beginning. Steve lives with every machine that has been made and will be made. The heartbeat stops, but the soul is still restless.  Rest in peace Steve! You are the reason I am typing this mail, from a wonderful device to a  wonderful human being!
He was a real visionary and inspiration; I listed to his Stanford speech on a regular basis just to make sure I'm on track with life and death.  My deepest sympathy to his family, friends and co-workers.  Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
The apple goes back into God's hands. If there is someone that can reach us from heaven and bring hope to this desperate world is Steve.&nbsp;
R.I.P. Mr. Jobs! I will keep tryin' to still think different!   “You know, my main reaction to this money thing is that it’s humorous, all the attention to it, because it’s hardly the most  insightful or valuable thing that’s happened to me.”  -Steve Jobs  “Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me … Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful… that’s what matters﻿ to me.”  -Steve Jobs  RIP Steve Jobs
My condolences to Steve Jobs's family, friends, and colleagues. Apple has made my life as a resident physician easier in many ways. A large part of the innovation deservedly goes to Jobs. The world will be a different place from now on, I think.
Thanks Steve for all. The day i bought my first mac and from that moment in my life my entire vision of art, design and perfection changed. Yesterday during the keynote I thought a lot about you, your verve, your passion and today I read this bad news…  Thanks for all.&nbsp;
I Love Apple, I love Apple products. They have brought me so much from  creativity to functionality, from Humour to Love, from happiness to  sadness. I guess no one can go on forever, I guess all the money in the world  can't buy health. However, if there is somewhere else and Steve is  looking down, I hope he has a smile on his his face for the job he's  done enriching so many lives with his great vision. Thanks for everything Mr Jobs 
It's sad to hear the news, but thanks to his existing, we can own specially memories.  Thanks and goodbye.
You have given the best of you so that I can give the best of me. Thank you!&nbsp;
Thank you Steve Jobs for the vision. I wouldn't be able to do what I   do today without a Mac. It's not just a computer, it has become a part   of me. My Mac has changed my life. Steve Jobs has changed my life.
With my heart broken but in mind all the Great things that He done, and hope that kind of man like Him will be again in this world.... we need.  I want to thank you Dear Steve  Rest in Peace  For the Family and Apple. 
Thanks for providing this link as a place to express our collective grief. Steve Jobs and Apple transformed our lives and I feel his loss so personally as if I knew him. My heart goes out to his family and co-workers. We all have lost a remarkable human being and the world will just not be the same without him in it.&nbsp;
   I'm just an everyday college student, I did not know Jobs personally, yet when I look back on my geeky self as a kid, my most fond, special, and important memories all somehow involve my family's apple computer.  We have only ever had apple computers; it seems such an insignificant detail of my early life, but I know that without Steve Jobs and his work, I would be a completely different person.  I understand he wasn't the only person working at apple, and there are many others to thank, yet his was the face that I knew and recognized as a child.  So I thank you Steve Jobs, you have had a profound effect on my life.  RIP Steve Jobs&nbsp;
The news shocked the world. Steve will remain in our memory for his  amazing creation. Rest in peace. 
 HI: 我来自中国，怀着沉痛的心情，向您致以最崇高的敬意，感谢您改变了世界，一路走好。。。   2011-10-05中国浙江省温州市             
 Just want to say that Mr. Jobs and the engineers at Apple are a big reason why I am in the profession that I am today. If it was not for the innovation and vision brought by Steve my life would not be the same.  Thank you very much and RIP
Thank you for being who you are and for dragging all the companies to evolve and make human life easier when dealing with computers.&nbsp;
I am so sad to hear Steve Jobs died hours ago. I know it is so hard to have pancreas cancer because my mom died suffering that kind of cancer. Today,I learned to use Iphone and I am so proud to have it in my hands because Steve Jobs created that.  May God bless him and be with him in the heaven.&nbsp;
I have just heard that the Lord has bought you to him. I  hope you everything well. In fact, you are the person who inspired me well. I heard about lots of  your story. Those stories inspired me to come to the USA to fulfill my  dream. I have bought your Iphone 4 on Sep.13, 2011, I hope you and apple  will make another milestone in the future. Unfortunately, the God is so like you that he has to take you there. I  hope you are happy in the heaven, and use your genius and spirit to  continue guide Apple to another top. My english is not as good as US citizen, but I hope you could receive  my wish. I have planned to buy a ipad2 when I get enough money. I will  continue to support you and your Apple. Your story and spirit will live  long. Thank you!&nbsp;
He was a real-life Prometheus, bringing the fire of imagination to the world...and the world was changed forever! 
Thank you for changing our lives in such an extraordinary way.  
My condolences to the family of Apple.&nbsp;The world lost a great man, a real visionary.&nbsp;In every Apple product is the essence of Steve Jobs and his work. Thanks Steve for letting us enjoy this work 
I will think of Steve every time I show my kids my Apple II it still works. Thank you.
The world has lost an amazing person. We are all better off from his many contributions. As long as there is Apple, their products we will be doing his memory justice and in many ways he will live through each of us. My heart goes out to all his loved ones.
Steve will be truly missed. I still remember fondly how jealous I was of  my first college roommate and his 12 in. PowerBook. I worked 50 hours a  week the entire summer after that first year so I could purchase my own  Powerbook and iPod. Today, I own a Macbook Pro, an iPod, an iPhone, an  iPhone 4, an iPad 2 and an Apple TV. I just couldn't get enough and I  can't thank Steve and Apple enough for bringing such enjoyment to my  life. 
He touched us all and gave us so much. His inventions and vision  challenge and enriched our lives. I can't imagine what my life would be  without Steve Jobs brilliant mind. I love my Apple "toys." I call them  toys with great affection. They are all fun like toys but they are a  serious part of my life. No longer is there only one way to communicate  with people. I carry a little phone that entertains me with games and  music, provides my e-mail, takes and displays my pictures,keeps my  calendar - I can go on and on. All are fantastic. What a gift to the  world. I just want to say thanks Steve Jobs. You have impacted my life.&nbsp;
I hope they have iPhones in heaven and if they don't I'm sure they soon will.&nbsp;
Sandy and I will miss your incredible creative spirit.  We are so saddened by your death.&nbsp;
I was in 7th grade when i got my first apple product and fell in love with it to the point i stayed up all night and researched about Apple from 3am at that night Steve jobs had been my role model and still is. RIP Steve Jobs 
Dear Apple,  I was never fortunate enough to ever meet Steve, or even attend an event he was present at. However, he made a difference in my life. Knowing computer "nerds" in high school, I was "converted" to Apple to find how amazing your products are and how much easier they made my life. If it wasn't for his ideas, ideals, and dreams, none of it would be possible. I now find my current Apple products to be that much more valuable knowing that Steve played a part in their creation. The same cannot be said for every product following (though I know some are in the works and I do not doubt that Apple will continue to hold Steve's values in the future).  I wish to extend my condolences to his family, friends, and to Apple. I hope you all will find peace in your hearts with time.  In a reply to my own mother's death, someone told me, "We do not die when our bodies collapse, we die when we are forgotten."  Steve will most certainly never be forgotten, he will live with us all forever in our hearts.&nbsp;
I could talk all day about Steve.  But the best way to describe him is revolutionary, idealistic, and fearless.  RIP Mr.Jobs, you will be dearly missed. Sincerely, Firm Apple Supporter.
 The company you built has made me proud that these types of innovations can come from the U S of A. My sympathies to your family and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
A complete human being, an admirable man, an inspiration to generations: all in one, named Steve Jobs. Thank you for changing the world for the better along with your closest partners, without whom you always repeated that nothing would have been possible. Thanks for "hangin' in there" as a true hero until the end. There are no ends... only new beginnings. Gob bless your family, who will miss you a lot, but who will also carry the eternal pride of being "yours truly". Your energy is forever alive and shared all over! Thanks for putting your knowledge and effort at work for all of us!&nbsp;
I am deeply saddened by the death of Steve Jobs. My heartfelt condolences goes out to his family, friends and the Apple family. He will surely be missed, we have lost one of the greatest human beings ever.
I think some times God cheats us as after giving us the gift,  he  realize that the gift which he gave to human-beings  has turned to be  the most precious and then he uses his power to get it back&nbsp;
Apple has given me possibilities that I would never have had for my students. I am forever grateful for working in a district with the vision to bring Apple into our classroom and give us the world at a keystroke. Thanks to Apple's technology I can ensure my own children a world of opportunities that my husband and I never had growing up. My sincere thanks to Mr. Jobs for believing in people he never met. I am a better teacher, student and most importantly, wife and mother because of his company. My prayers and thoughts.
You will live in history forever!
Dear Steve, You have changed the way the people communicate. I feel like i have  known you for very long even though we didnt meet. I had been inspired  by you in every way. We will remember you for eternity. May your soul  rest in peace in heaven. We are very proud of you.&nbsp;
I wish that the report of his death "was truly exaggerated" but… He was a true inspiration to millions, if not billions of people worldwide. Even if you aren't an Apple, Next or Pixar lover, you most likely were affected by his technological wonder. RIP Mr. Jobs. May God Bless You and Your Family, as well as your Apple Family and Friends Worldwide.
Apple has always been my favorite electronic company.  Losing Steve   Jobs is tragic. 
 Thank you for allowing us to send our condolences and prayers to the Jobs family, we are all thinking of them and wanted to let them know we thought highly of their father and husband.&nbsp;
There are few people you can say this about, but the world IS a better place because of Steve.  Rest in peace. 
Thank you Steve for bringing us revolutionary products that finally bring advanced technology to the fingertips of ALL users.  You have left a mark on all of us and will always be remembered.  I'm writing this on my MacBook Pro, with my iPhone next to me and my iPad on the table.  Rest in Peace and God's Blessings.  Condolences to your family. 
Support and sympathy to Apple family. Steve legacy will always live.&nbsp;
As everyone has good and bad days, I often found that when I needed inspiration or just a pick-me-up I would turn to Steve's product launch videos. The way he brought magic to the world through his words and through his imagination always seemed to lift me up. What I wouldn't give to hear Steve say: "But  wait...there's one more thing...."&nbsp;
Steve's the best thing that ever happened to computers. He should be called the father of modern technology. We will miss you Steve! Thanks for all great thing you shared with us. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
This Apple girl is very sad for the loss of Steve Jobs. There are very few companies out there that you can count on to give you true quality products and amazing service. His does both, consistently. Says a lot about the man, that he built a company like that. My condolences to all of you at Apple who are feeling this loss personally.
I am very shocked at this news, and my thoughts and condolences go to  his family and those that new him as a personal friend.  I agree with  the sentiments of the bearer of this news - a sad loss to the world of a  creative genius.&nbsp;
Dear Apple Teams, We deeply sorryy to hear untimely departure of Steve. He was a visionary and we will not see another of his sort ever again. Steve was inspiration to many many millions of individuals especially in Technology world. His creation and creativity will always be remembered as long as this world exists. His contributions to better this world are immense. We will miss Steve a lot. Our deepest sympathies to Jobs family, Apple Team and people who admired Steve's ingenuity. &nbsp; May The Almighty bestow Peace on his soul, such is our prayer.&nbsp;
I share my deepest condolences to Steve's family. My prayers are with Steve and his family. The world lost a true visionary. Rest in Peace Mr. Jobs. 
Steve didn't just invent technology.  He inspired an attitude to   create and gave this generation tools with which to work.  He blurred   the lines between work and play and changed the flavor of our culture   for the better.&nbsp;
Dear Steve.  My life has changed dramatically by you and Apple. I'll always remember you, rest in peace again.&nbsp;
I love you  May Steve rest in peace. I shall never forget you.
Thank you for being the human being that you were and for showing us the meaning of being humble. God bless his family.&nbsp;
Dear Apple,  My deepest sympathy to apple and all its employees  Im sad but im sure that steve has passed on a great deal of experience and inspiration to you all  I love Apple and all of your products and im a user for life    God Bless Steve
He taught me to "Think Different." I don't have many heroes, but he was one to me. I feel like I have lost a good friend. He'll be missed.&nbsp;
You are going to be greatly missed, thanks for your great contribution to this world.&nbsp;

Sincerly we lost a big and genuis man. Tanks Steve for all!  My Condolences for all the Apple's team
Wow, that's a really incredible bad news for me, one of his followers because Steve was more than a genius, very creative and all his ideas, he just change the world to a new vision, Apple!  The technology history has to be written before and after Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve really changed my view of life - from the day on when i saw the iPhone  2G in the news, I felt for Apple. I'm really impressed how Steve revolutionized the computer industry. He was such an incredible gifted and talented man when it came down to build, produce and sell an amazing product. With his way of seeing the world with other eyes and thinking about things we really needed he just simply changed the world. I was devastated when I heard he passed away. He was a good person and he did good things for us. Its really sad  to see that an era has come to an end. I really hope he's in a better place  and he finally can rest in peace.
There are no words to describe how much we will miss our God,  inspiration and mentor Steve Jobs. Condoleances to his wife, children and all his family.  May he Rest In Peace and he will be remembered forever, such as Bob  Marley.  Steve Jobs you are our Legend,  Good Bye 
my heart broke to hear the sad news.....you changed so many people's lives...lucky for heaven to have you
Steve, Thanks for all the good stuff you've brought to this world. You will be remembered and missed forever and I hope the company continues to deliver the best product. I was saddened by the news when my high school son Nick called me to bear the bad news. Our family have always been a true believer and very supportive of the products you and your team have created.  May GOD be with you and rest in peace.
Thanks Steve for all great things you created. Thanks Steve for Apple which you found out. Thanks Steve for the new generation touchable electicities. Thanks Steve for the iPod I'm having. And thanks for all. God bless you in heaven.!!!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is the driving force behind what I do in my life. I am a junior,  computer science major at Washington State University because I wanted to  improve people's lives like he did. When I heard the new of his passing, I  immediately began to cry. He has done so mush for the world that will live  on for ever. He instilled within me drive, character, and focus, and I always think of him as a mentor. I hope to work at Apple someday, and I hope if  I do, I accomplish feats that would make him proud. I am deeply saddened by the news.&nbsp;
I am a college student from China, and I learn something from Jobs since I was in high school. Mr Jobs is a legendary man. He created Apple, which is a brand that changes the world. A lot of student in China think it proud to own an iPhone. We thank him for creating such an excellent product. Now he leaves us forever, but his spirit will inspire forever.
He brought to a turbulent world vision that will outlast generations. Thank you Steve. Thank you.
Thanks Steve for your pioneering work with Steve Wozniak in bringing the Apple and Macintosh computers into my life. They have been a joy for me and many others. Your vision changed the world for the better. Windows owes its existence to your vision.  We miss you already.   But I know we will see you again.  :-)
The world was a better place with you in it.    Thank you for your many contributions.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  I already miss you. I still can't believe that you're gone. So sad. You were a part of my life and now I feel like I've lost someone in my family. 
a big thank you to him and his vision for the things left and trend and we are all here in this great community .... greetings and thanks steve jobs .....&nbsp;
 Steve jobs was a genius! He created a whole new revolution, he was a trend setter. Apple couldn't have made it far without Steve jobs. RIP Steve jobs may god bless your soul. He truly was a genius. Thank you for this great advance in technology. You will be greatly missed.
No single person has done more for technology than Steve Jobs.  An amazing visionary, technological genius and human being.  The world will never see the likes of you again.  Thank you Steve Jobs; may you rest in peace knowing that the light within you still burns in the hearts of others. 
              To the man who brought me out of the darkness -               and into the beautiful world of Mac - Steve Jobs - you were             the Apple of my eye!               I shall be forever grateful to you!               Blessed be - You are now free to soar with the angels.<br>
A dear and true friend to everyone of us who even picked up a phone, worked  on a computer, or listened to music with an i-pod, .... he will always be a  part of our life's and our children's future's. God Bless you Steve a truly  great man ... and Thank you for all you have giving us. Condolences to his family and children. 
....someone comes along who fundamentally changes the way humans   relate and interact with one another.  Steve was that person, bridging   two millennia and billions minds.  Heartfelt condolences to his family   and friends who should be the focus of all our positive energy at this   moment.  And heartfelt thanks to the man who changed the world, making   it a better and more open place. 
 I just can't believe this, a great man, a wonderful man has died. I don't remember the day that I met the existence of this amazing man and everything that he did, but I just wanna say that he is an inspiration for me, I love technology and some day  I wanna be like him, his story it's just an example that everything is possible in this life, everything, like overcome the death. I'm really sad because one of my big dreams was meet and talk with him, now is impossible, but some day I'm gonna be in the same place that he was, walking around the Apple campus. Now I'm gonna start the university, and my example of life is gonna be him, and always in my mind will be the words that he said in the speech at Stanford's university, that makes me think a lot... Thank you Steve Jobs, I won't never forget you, my idol. Whit love and sadness...&nbsp;
You show your greatness,dedication which become the legacy for the next generation.
The Thomas Edison of our time. A true legend of this generation. One who will forever help shape technology for decades to come. A true genius lost at such a young age. My prayers go out to his family and friends.
Mr. Jobs,  Thank you for being such a positive influence in the world of Technology.  My thoughts and prayers are with your family and the employees of Apple as they continue to carry on your legacy.
 today becomes history, a great businessman and great human being as I'm concerned, we owe much to him ... the energy that goes with him return it the same way ... Rest in peace Steven Paul Jobs                   
Although I never met you or personally knew you. I am truly saddened by your  loss. I am an Apple fan. I have truly appreciated the genius that went into  the devices that were created under your watch; each and everyone (including the iPhone 4S and the Apple Bluetooth Headset). RIP Steve...I like so many millions of others will miss you.
I was really hoping we would be co-workers someday soon, but God had  other plans. You were truly an amazing individual. May you rest in  peace.
 My Sympathy and deepest Condolences to Mr. Jobs. You are just too precious to Apple Corp. and the world. RIP.
A true visionary, Steve and company transformed the personal computing experience, I've had the pleasure of working as a key supplier to Apple, and as demanding as Steve was of his own company and suppliers, to be even peripherally involved in the great products Apple make, is a great memory.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Mr. Jobs.  Thank you for being eccentric, uncompromising and most of all, hungry and foolish. Thank you for paving the way, you were light years ahead of your time and we still have yet to fully understand the measure of your incredible genius. There will not be a greater visionary than yourself, at least not in my lifetime.  Thank you.
I have been a loyal Mac user since 1999 and love the fact that as Steve  grew Apple to what it is today he always made us feel like we were on  the wild and exciting ride with him. He will be missed.&nbsp;
  We will never forget him. He changed our life to better and we keep him in our prayers.
&nbsp; <p>I would like to express my deepest condolence. The world lost such a wonderful innovator. There might be some more new ideas was vanished with him. Thank You<br><br></p> 
You change the way we think about a phone you've brought a whole new  meaning to the word phone iphone 4s, you've changed the way we teach at  schools ipad2 and you changed the way we listen to our music ipod touch  ipod nano ipod shuffle and the way we surf the web at home, youve taken &nbsp;technology to a whole new level and i would like to thank you for that,  these products are a whole new way of living thanks steve jobs may you  r.i.p.
Steve Jobs had seen Apple products made in China and distributed worldwide before he left us and this is the history way of  Chinese remembering to this great human being.&nbsp;
If I could achieve 1/10th of what Steve accomplished, I'd die happy. But  only the good die young.
My name is Tonny Xu, and I'm an iOS developer in Tokyo. I was shocked to see the news that Steve passed away this morning. I really want to say that he changed my life.  It was June, 2008, when Steve announced iPhone 3G and also it would be available in Japan. I was inspired and with a few minutes of thinking I dropped my contract work, and started to develop iPhone apps. That's the biggest change in my life. Now I'm a chief engineer. All of these things would never happen without Steve and Apple.  I watched Steve's commencement at Stanford University. It was the most inspiring commencement I had ever seen. I also introduced this video to many of my friends, many of my colleagues. I want to say Steve really changed our life.  At this moment, I want express my deeply sorry, and I believe Steve will be remember by us, by our children, by our children's children.&nbsp;
Too much sorrow. I cried. The world lost one of the greatest geniuses of history. To you, Apple employees, my feelings of grief, but feel honored to have had the company of this great man. <br>
The impact of Steve's legacy on modern life will be difficult to exaggerate, though many will surely try.  He was and will remain an inspiration to generations of young people trying to create a better world.  I am deeply grateful for having been alive to witness the public portion of his passage through history since my childhood and for vicariously sharing the story of his life as he wrote each thrilling chapter.  His triumphs, his mistakes and his ability to transmute some of the latter into the former will long remain the stuff of business legend.  In his shortcomings I see his humanity and the possibility for all of us to find our own greatness.  With a saddened heart I bid farewell to a man I never met, but whose dreams materialized into the tools with which I make my own dreams a reality.  Dreamers have lost a hero today.  I am a dreamer and I feel a bit more alone today; like something irreplaceable has been lost forever. And it has.  Farewell Steve Jobs, thank you for making my life more productive, more satisfying, more powerful, more pleasant, more fun, more amazing and more beautiful.  You join the list of people to whom I will forever be in debt. I will do my best to repay you by helping make this a better world.  May you dream on forever. The only device I have ever owned that completely surpassed my childhood dreams of what was possible. 
While I've never met Steve in person, you can feel his presence in every Apple product he has been a part of.  I can only hope that his spirit continues to influence products in the future.
I come from China. I have never seen him face to face. I have never listened to his talk till now. I have never been to America to see his great company . But whenever I turn on my Mac, I can feel his spirit.
Thank You For all you have done for the human race. You and the company you   built are amazing.
Steve jobs created a culture that will expand in consciousness as he expands into another dimension of living! Steve Jobs lived his dreams and created more dreams for us. I love you Steve Jobs! Create in Peace! Love.
I am so sorry for every ones loss. Steve meant a lot to me and was the reason for some very important decisions. My prayers for the family wife and children. Steve will be missed so very much.
It is a sad thing when the world loses the shine of a genius like Mr. Jobs, but we still have the lustre of his wonderful legacy with us.  I'm really sorry he passed away but I am sure Apple will continue to shine with his inspiration. 
I am so very sorry to hear of Steve's passing. He was inspiring and the  things he has created are incredible and revolutionary. He will truly be missed.
 The Great Innovator
Goodbye Steve and thanks for the memories.... 
A man who has changed the way that the world thinks regarding technology, an epic leader in the world, a man who had ideas that no one else could dream of. He was the modern Thomas Alva Edison; Steve Jobs has personally changed my life, since I am in the engineering field, I have always looked up to him as a mentor.  I will miss him very much.&nbsp;
 God bless Steve Jobs, he has inspired me to be a better human being and to understand that everything is possible if we work hard to become our dreams true.
I cannot think of a single person who has impacted my generation more.  His innovation has altered not only how we communicate, but also how we operate our lives each day, in ways I never thought possible as a child.  My condolences to Steve's family and friends. 
Steve Jobs was a revolutionary. I don't think I would be able to function wi thout my iPhone and I am very excited to upgrade to the iPhone4S. My heart goes out to his family and friends.
we all carry around his soul with us everyday in our pockets 
He left this world a little better by creating a company that will continue his legacy.&nbsp;
I am crying because Steve Jobs is creative spirit larger than life,&nbsp; enormous in  the history of the world, who had the&nbsp;courage and confidence&nbsp;to follow that path  so clear and compelling&nbsp;in his mind that lifted his being from the mortality of  the everyday, to the sphere of the eternally inspiring. May he rest in peace,  forever.  
My deepest condolences to the family of Steve Jobs.  Though I did not   know him, I so appreciate all he did in his vision and development of   the Apple products and the computer world in general.  My thoughts and prayers will be with Mr. Jobs' family and friends.   
Steve, you kindness and philanthropy moved the entire world, we'll never forget you.  Keep Walking Steve&nbsp;
For every person that has ever used a computer we say thank you for your amazing contribution to  humanity. Your perseverance, vision, simplicity and beauty of design have inspired so many may we  continue what you started. RIP
Just paying my respects. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs, an irreplaceable loss.
A loss is not a loss unless you toss its thoughts! I will never lose Steve Jobs, as I will never toss his thoughts!
This is sent with heartfelt sympathy to the family of Steve Jobs, Apple Inc., and the many friends. The world is a better place because he lived in this world. I can only think of him warmly when I think of all my Apple Computers have done for me. I had an Apple IIE, on which I drafted my PHd dissertation (in U.S. History), and used all sorts of cabling to get it over to the Macintosh Plus on which I printed it with the earliest HP inkjet printer to work with a Macintosh. I also worked as a research assistant in graduate school, putting my archival research into an Excel spreadsheet. I wrote an article and numerous lectures on a Macintosh until I transformed a doll collecting hobby into a business and went on the internet with it. I still used a MacBook computer all these years later, though I have not graduated to an iPhone yet. I've thought about it, especially the few times I have traveled. These days the world seems to be brought to me. My husband is an Industrial Designer, so I understand the excitement of developing and bringing out new products.  What a void, and what a brave battle against cancer so long!&nbsp;
Rest in peace Steve Jobs. You leave us with no just gadgets but with a philosophy of following your instincts and your heart. You are a great inspiration to my life.
For having paved the way in all our greatest technogical advances the last twenty years.  You are brilliant and you will be missed.  -
You will always be remembered.  
Steve,  In a world of Chaos you showed us a beacon of simplicity and beauty.  With Macbook Air you made us believe computers can be sexy again.  You have done so much, so well. I wish you had stayed with us a little  longer.  You and Apple will be remembered.
I am very very sad. Steve jobs,he was my hero. Thank you. 
I'm chinese. My english is not very well. when I heard the news I'm very sad. Steve has brung us so much suprise. Even we can say : Jobs chang the world and he makes the world so beautiful. He never know me,I just show my sadness,I'm using iphone to write this mail,I feel Steve's soul is in my phone,so,with remembering ,we love Jobs.
Truly a great loss, of a much admired person who helped millions improve their lives through his products. &nbsp;He has done more for business, arts, technology and the happiness of many, than most heads of state or anyone else I can think of, for that matter. &nbsp; Thank you Steve, and thank you Apple, for improving the quality of our lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;
I express my heartfelt condolence to the family and colleagues of Steve Jobs.  He was an iconic person with extraordinary vision and I will always remember and pray for him every time I use graphical user interface on my computer, clicking mouse, touching iphone and ipad screens..... we humanity are so much indebted to Steve Jobs and people like him.  Our life wouldn't be so comfortable and fun without contribution of people like Edison, Bell, and Jobs.  God bless you and rest in piece .....I cannot hold my tears. 
Thank you Steve Jobs for helping to change our world.  I remember being in  the sixth grade and having our first computer in our classroom.  I loved playing The Oregon Trail on our Apple 2C.  Now I am a 38 year old teacher and  I am teaching my students how to use the iPad for their own studies.  Steve Jobs and all the Apple employees changed education and changed my life for the better.  Thank you.  We will all miss Steve Jobs and continue to supp ort the company that continues to make education a priority.
Dear Steve,  You changed the world. You made it different. Your legacy will be remembered. Apple will be even better in years to come.&nbsp;
We will always remember Steve Jobs! Thanks for everything Steve Jobs! You will be remembered! You were a genius at technology and you are great! 
The world makes way for the man who knows where he is going. Good bye, Steve Jobs.    
I've been an Apple fan since the beginning. Without Steve Jobs, Apple would  have never gotten off the ground. We've lost the creative genius of our time. In appreciation for all of Steve Jobs' accomplishments.
iRIP.  I can't think of anyone so has changed the face of the modern world so much in his own lifetime so quickly.  A visionary, mentor and in a world compressed with money and profit he strived to innovate rather than accumulate... And we thanked him by buying his products. We have lost the worlds coolest nerd who made it big. We will miss you Steve
My condolences to the Jobs family and friends. Even though I didn't know  the man personally, I feel like I've known Steve thru his creations. I  watch all the keynotes and check the website for all the new updates and  products. I have been a big fan of the iPhone, iPod and  the iMac for  years.  Steve will be missed. R.I.P. Mr Jobs. 
I still remember the Vatican prank call. He and Wozniak were so close!&nbsp;
All I can do is cry. We Love you Steve. Thank you for everything!!!!&nbsp;
This is the greatest lost for humanity worldwide. Steve really was amazing in all the things he have done, and I think that without him - the world we live in today is not the the world that we could lived if he wasn't there. And now he really isn't here anymore... It's intangible.  Thank you for every vision that you had and the way you made it real for us, people like you are rare - what's makes it even greater lost. I hope god rest his soul. Thank you for YOU.&nbsp;
My friends always knew that I was very unfriendly with all the Apple devices, specially iPod, iPhone, iPad and MacBook.     But for 2 years, I became a huge fan of all the technologies that all the devices from Apple gave for the human being. Now I see how useful and how pratical they are, how easy to use, how helpful too.     And I know that all those things came from the mind of this genius that saddly has just left this earth and now he's in another place much happier.     I thank you Steve Jobs for founding Apple and discovering all those devices for a better world and I thank you for convincing me to enter this world of Apple and now I see how easy life became with it.     Thx Steve!
  You introduced iPod, iPhone, iPad &amp; iMac, but you never spoke about iCry.. RIP Steve &nbsp; &nbsp;
Mr. Jobs:  Thank you for your innovative creations and contributions to mankind. You   are a true icon and visionary that will be sorely missed.  May you now finally rest in peace...&nbsp;
We have lost the most influential person of our generation.  Steve Jobs' works will affect humanity for generations to come.&nbsp;
I  just bought my first laptop  and I really  like it, thanks to STEVE.  Rest in peace. 
My heart and prayers go out to Steve Jobs family and friends. Truly you have lost a wonderful man. On a personal note I want to thank him for his innovation and creativity in helping develop the iPad. It has helped so many in the handicapped community. Thank you for helping make their lives better, thank you for helping give my wife a better life.&nbsp;
To Mr. Jobs, Your vision and legacy will ever continue to touch millions of lives  around the world. Thank you for the great adventure and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Thank you for your visionary ideas, amazing innovation and leadership. I am writing you this message from my apple macbook, while talking on face time to my girlfriend in new york from London. You truly inspired an entire generation and your legacy will live on.&nbsp;
Thank you for changing the world as we know it through your technical genius. You will be greatly missed as today the world has lost one of  it's iconic innovators. Rest in Peace Steve. Your imagination will live on  forever!&nbsp;
I was always a true supporter of Apple. Most of my love of Apple was  Steve Jobs. He brought a feeling to the company that can not be  described. He made me feel like I was a part of the company every time I  would see him releasing the newest Apple device. He had so much charm  and life to him, and that translated into Apple. When I think of Apple,  I think of Steve. He stood behind Apple products and he amazed me with  his knowledge and charisma. I truly hope that he was able to live a  fulfilling life and enjoy all that he had earned.20 He will be forever missed. 
Hi Jobs, hope you can hear me in the other world. I am a Ph.D student come from China,and I am a big fan of you and Apple. Your spirit is the most precious fortune for me and many people. Hope you rest in peace, bless you.&nbsp;
The term " one in a million " is not even enough to describe a man like Steve Jobs he was " one in six billion " he was a genius and he revolutionized t he industry and the world.&nbsp;
I am sadden to hear that he has passed. I can only think that he is in a  better place. I will always remember him, I studied a lot of the great  business and company that he helped create and my heart and prayers go  out to his family, and the Apple family. Respectfully a life long Apple fan.
What a loss to the human race.  This man made it possible for ordinary people to use the PC. I learned to use computers because there was the MAC.  Our sincere condolences to his family.
A person like Steve comes around only once in several hundred years.    The greatest leaders and visionaries in history couldn't have touched   as many lives as he did simply due to the limitations of their time.    He gave me the inspiration I needed to become the person I am today.    He proved to me that people will, if given the option, chose quality   over cheap, style over plain, color over grey, flavor over bland, and   music over static.  He taught me that nothing is more rewarding than   captivating peoples hearts and giving them reason to dream.  I am   privileged to have shared the same time on Earth with him, and I look   forward to spending my life knowing that someone like him, and what he   believed in, is possible. I applaud you Steve. Bless you and your family.
 Steve, you have touched very many people in a profound. I hope that it may be remembered that you brought happiness to a great so many people. Thanks and may you Rest In Peace.            
Hi Steve, One day, my friend was holding her iPod mini. My mother saw it and thought it was "cool". She turned to me and said, "Why don't you have that?" I said, "Because you didn't buy one for me." So we bought one. It was pink. Since then, I've gone on to own the iPod Nano, the iPhone 2G, 3G, 3Gs, 4, a Macbook, and then the iPad 2. By the release of the iPad 2, I didn't even bat an eyelash. It came out as an Apple product, so I was going to get it. Steve Jobs, you are Gutenberg to handwritten books, Edison to living in candlelight, and Aristotle to the sciences. In the past decade, your innovations have changed the way we lived, just the way you envisioned it. I liked the way the Jetsons could call their friends and talk face to face. You liked the way the Jetsons could call their friends and talk face to face. Now it's called FaceTime. With each product release, I expected revolutionary, and I got revolutionary. You've revolutionized humankind and the way we live our day to to day lives. Thanks, Steve. An Apple consumer.
To the Family at Apple My condolences on your loss. It wasn't just the ease of using a Mac that brought me into even learning how to use a computer, it was also Steve Jobs. His was the face I saw when I thought about Apple. It was his passion and his creative edge that inspired me to try things on a computer, to feel that I "could do it" because Steve Jobs and the teams at Apple had made it work so well for me. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Dear Steave     Thank you, giving me  great things. 
 Dear Steve, I don't know whether you were a good or bad person. I don't know if your vision will ultimately be good or bad for our world's future. All I know is that you made my life easier. And so, you've left your imprint on me and my work, and my work is changing the world hopefully for the better. That is the irony of Nature versus The Beast. Here is one of my favorite qoutes from my favorite authors that truely defines your legacy: "We all die. The goal isn't to live forever, the goal is to create something that will." -- Chuck Palahniuk<div><br></div><div>As we say in my mother Assyrian language: Alaha Manikhlookh goo Perdesa (May God let you rest in Heaven). &nbsp;</div>
Such an inspiration as a human being. Thank you so much for showing us what drive can do and how it can change the world. Fly high and rest in peace. &nbsp;My condolences from Chile.
I worked for Apple from 2004-2010. In those years I worked harder than I had ever worked before in my entire professional career. I met so many wonderful people who are so committed to making the best possible products. Thank you SJ for creating a company that provides so many jobs in a climate filled with uncertainty. Thank you for my stock options that allowed me to buy a house. Thank you for my employee discount that allowed me to buy Apple products for my friends and family. Most of all thank you for being relentless in your pursuit of excellence in your products. I didn't always like starting over (hated it actually) but the stock price speaks for itself. That is why you were the CEO and so many were not. You rocked the tech world!&nbsp;
There are no words to express the sadness I feel over the loss of Steve  Jobs.  The world has lost a great man and an innovator.  My condolences  to his family, friends, and all of the people at Apple. 
God bless you Steve, you changed my life!!!
Thought I have never worked for Apple, never met Mr.Jobs in person, I  feel as if I lost a grandfather. Such words may not mean much to some, but they mean a lot to me. Steve Jobs has been an inspiration in my life, and a mentor for  everything I did, though he never knew it. I feel a little emotional of his passing, though our eyes have never  met.  I do thank God that Steve's struggles are now at rest. He changed the  world, all while fighting his own battles within himself.  He will  continue to be a mentor to me in my memory, just as he always was.  R.I.P Mr.Jobs. The world has forever been touched by your vision,  knowledge, and understanding.
Thank you for all you have done for bettering all of our lives. You will  be missed and the planet a sadder place for your passing.
RIP Steve world must remember you as a man who create many fantastic things into this world.
 My condolences to his family and friends, he was a great man that made me fall in love with apple. Thank you Steve Jobs, Rest in peace            
"Our time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."  Thanks Steve! 
Farewell Steve. Good Jobs!!&nbsp;
Thank you for creating excellent, exciting and engaging products that  just work. You were a true visionary. My thoughts are with your wife and  children, may you rest in peace.
As a huge fan of Apple and Steve Jobs, I would like to personally  express my condolences to his family. He leaves behind an astounding  record of success and innovation that could only be driven by him. This  world and how we function as society couldn't possibly be the same  without his passion, presence and innovation. Steve Jobs is an  incredible legacy that will live on forever in our thoughts and hearts.  I wish the absolute best for the future of Apple and hope that they can  help keep Steve's passion for the success, growth and simplicity of the  world strong. My heart goes out to his family and my deepest sympathy  and thoughts are with you. Stay strong. You have a world; literally,  of love and support. God bless and take care.
Thank-you for changing the world Mr. Jobs.  R.I.P&nbsp;
I sit here in a bit of a haze over Steve's passing.  He was an amazing man, and will be missed. Sent from my iPhone, thanks to Steve! 
Condoloences to the family and friends of Steve Jobs.  I've been a customer of Apple since my first computer--an Apple IIe--which I still have.  Thanks for improving my life through technology.
Thank you Mr. Jobs for being one of the greatest innovators of our time. Your impact on the world is immeasurable and your life will never be forgotten. Thank you.&nbsp;
Thank you for making my life just a little better. Your products have truly brought joy to so many people. I use your phone, iPod, and MacBook everyday. While I did not have the pleasure of knowing you personally, I am truly saddened by your passing. You connected with more people than you could ever know. My thoughts are with your friends, family, and colleagues. You will be missed.
As hard as we may try, we can never put into words how truly amazing  Steve Jobs was. The world has suffered a hard loss. My thoughts and  heart is with his family, friends, and the Apple community. RIP.
Dear Mr Jobs,  The world has lost a great person in your death. You were quite possibly the most influential man to have ever lived; I thank you Mr Jobs for the inspiration and joy you brought both myself, and the world. No one person in history has ever caused so many jaw-dropping moments, and brought people so unanimously together in utter disbelief at the amazing, magical things your products do. You advanced the world in ways not imagined possible thirty years ago. You were, and still are, my idol. Thankyou for all that you have done for technology, and for human evolution as a whole. Rest in peace Sir, my thoughts are with you, your family and your friends.
It is an absolute honor to live in the same century as yours, and witness the great realm you have built.  Your influences will always remain, and you will always be remembered as Legend.  rest in peace.
HE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME, A TOTAL COMPUTER IDIOT, TO   USE ONE WITH EASE AND CONFIDENCE.  I WILL MISS THE TECH BOSS.
To the entire Apple Family,    My family and I are very saddened to learn of Steve Jobs' passing. Steve was a genius and a visionary that changed the world through his insight and visions of technology  that brought the world closer together. Our family enjoys our iPhones, iMac, and iPad 2. My husband and I worked in the technology sector for a number of years and  Apple/MacIntosh connectivity products were always very popular products in so many industries. My younger son reminds us that Steve Jobs spoke, not of himself, but of his  entire Apple team, when introducing new products and technologies - - - so modest and kind, yet the genius behind all of it. Our heartfelt condolences go out to Steve Jobs'  family and his Apple family here and abroad. In this case, the good truly die too young. God Bless, Steve Jobs. Rest in Peace. You will truly be missed. 
It is really a sad day. I was surprised to see the news of Steve's demise as I imagined that he will bounce back the way Apple did. He has been an inspiration for many and most importantly to me. He demonstrated resilience, grit and determination.  We will miss his creative genius.  Rest In Peace, Steve &nbsp; May the almighty bestow courage and strength to the family and friends of Steve at such a irreparable loss.
I am so sorry to hear that Steve Jobs has gone, he will forever live in  are hearts. RIP steve you where and still are a genius one of the best the world has  ever seen.
For never having owned an Apple product, and rarely have used one, I am  still heart broken to hear of Job's passing.  It isn't just the products that Jobs had help produce, it is also his  vision.  I was always inspired how he had the vision to create, and  innovate. Without his vision we wouldn't have one of my favorite things,  Pixar.  Steve Jobs has left his mark on this world, and the world is better for it.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
Terribly sad ... Peace to his soul, condolences to all....   :( &nbsp;
The world has lost one of the most influential and brilliant men of our time.  You have forever changed the world starting from your garage. I feel blessed to be alive during his era. Thank you for everything!  RIP Steve Jobs
Even though this is an announcement impacting business and the loss of a business leader that one may not personally know - it completely kicks you in the gut and feels incredibly emotional. It is because this brand, this man, and his genius has impacted us on a very personal level and changed how we live.&nbsp;
I have been using Apple products for as long as I can remember. He was a great man with great vision. I am so sad I don't know what to think. Attached you will find my computer license from 1984. I am so sad. 
My life has been enhanced by Apple products which started in the mind of Steve Jobs.  Thank you for your innovation.....you will be missed by so many. My prayers are for your family.     Respectfully,&nbsp;
I live in Brazil and right now I'm getting prepared for the college entrance exams, hoping to study computer science and to have just 0.1% of the geniality of Jobs. Because I know that with only this small amount, I'll be able to succeed. Jobs was and still is one of my biggest inspirations. I hope he rests in peace. He'll never be forgotten. 
My career, and my hobbies wouldn't be possible without your machines. Thank you for shaping my life Mr. Jobs—I couldn't be more satisfied with the way it's turned out.  Dearly missed.&nbsp;
so devastating.  this family has every and all apple products ever made... he will be missed but with every good thing, his legacy will live on.  his impact on the world of technology is just outstanding.  it would be a wonderful thing to now have his feature etched into the glass walls on every apple store .  apple is his.. always was and always will be.&nbsp;
A true visionary. Steve Jobs brilliance, innovation and passion revolutionized the world of technology and will continue to enrich the lives of generations to come.  Why god always takes the best ones too young, we will never know.  RIP Steve Jobs.
Still remember my first iPod shuffle.  You were a beacon in the world of technology and a inspiration for all of us.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs gifted technology to people, such as myself, for whom math and the sciences were a drag during school years, and who had hoped and believed that the subjects would not be given any further consideration beyond graduation. Ever.  Thirty years later, I cannot imagine my life without a Mac: an indispensable third arm, an extension of the brain, a work of art;  a good companion when in despair,  a transformative connection to and with the world.  The premier gateway to a new era: the Information Age.  I hope that the new regime at Apple will not soon, if ever, forget The Man's key points: - make it the best, - make it beautiful.  My most heartfelt feelings of shared sorrow go to Mr. Jobs' family.&nbsp;
You are man that change the world with your innovation.  A visionary leader that inspired millions people in the world.    Rest In Peace Mr. Jobs.        Our Deepest Condolences,&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is one of the few people that made this world a better place.
Your intuition and attention to small details helped capture everyones  imagination and showed us that believing in our selves can make anything  possible!  You'll be greatly missed.&nbsp;
 Thank you for selflessly sharing your life with the rest of the world, even beyond your physical reached. You had undoubtedly made a difference - a life well lived.&nbsp;
What a sad thing, to have seen one of the bright lights of vision go dark before it's time.  However, the world will long remember the legacy or innovation that Steve demonstrated and the inspiration will be everlasting.  It has been amazing living in a world that Steve changed through his genius and passion for making beautiful things. <br>
 Hi,  I never met Steve Jobs but I would have liked to. It's really unfair, a genius like Steve leaves the world so young ! You were (and still will be) my idol, my mentor for business development. I'd like to create my own company and I'll always miss you. Take care in paradise, eat Apple and don't open the Windows ;)  Sincerely condolences to his family, wife and girls.&nbsp;
Can't believe that one of the biggest inspirations in the computing world is  gone. Steve is Apple. The new iPhone should be named after him. My thoughts  and my companies thoughts are with all of Steves family. Steve may be gone but he will never be forgotten.  RIP&nbsp;
I could not beleive it. I was about to go on gmail then I saw the link and omg what a sad ending. Steve Jobs was a great Apple leader, and I truly feel bad for him. I am extremely sorry of what happened. God bless the great Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Sad to see such a visionary go so early in life. May Steve Jobs rest in peace and I wish the Apple family and Steve's family lots of strength to get through this.
&nbsp;I saw steve jobs as the most visionary person in tech world.  Im really sorry for this loss, and present my sincere condolences to his family and friends.&nbsp; the world has a new star shining!!     R.I.P. Steve!! <br>
You are an inspiration to all cancer patients, thank you for helping me without even knowing RIP
I am grateful that in my lifetime I have had the great opportunity to meet or know extraordinary people, and Steve is one of them. I am writing from my home country, Colombia, and I can tell that Steve was a kind of citizen of the world, belonging to us, to everyone...Rest in peace.
It is a loss for everyone to have such an enigmatic man pass on. But rest assured he has made his mark on the world and will be remembered. 
To the Jobs family,  My sincere&nbsp;condolences&nbsp;for you in this difficult moments. I admired Steve very much.  He and all of you are in my prayers! &nbsp;&nbsp;
Steve Jobs RIP. I really would have like to know you. You was, are and will be my inspiration. A man that changed the world with his mind, with his way to think the things, with his way to re-invent the things. He was a visionary that loved take something and make it better. "For that and much more, I send to Apple and to Steve greetings from Colombia; you will be in our hearts forever".  I really sorry for my English, I'm from Colombia I hope you Understand me.  I hear a lot from my family and friends "Apple is gonna crumble", but I know it doesn't happen. Please think, fight and invent. Make the magic that Steve like to do.  Keep being bigger and bigger, because Apple isn't just a corporation, Apple is a family ... is a community ... is a way to live.  I'm studying systems and i really like (in the future of course) be one of your workers.&nbsp;
Inspirational to all.  We all are mourning his all too sudden--and soon--departure from this world.  Our prayers to his family and friends.&nbsp;
You made the worlds greatest electronic devices, owner for years... Love every product... Will be missed 
"Inspiring mentor" says it all. As a struggling design student just released into a world of hurt, none have brought me as much inspiration and direction as you have.  Thank you so very much...&nbsp;
Dear Apple and Steve Job's Family.. Steve brought the future to us, he did not wait for that future. Steve had  changed the world from Schools to Hospitals.. Even Presidents use iPad to Mac.. Steve you are God.. May peace be with you!
Steve,  Today begins with a very sad news. I'm deeply sorry about your loss. This is really sad.  You have been the inspiring mentor to many of us. I learned a lot and believe I still have more to learn from you.  Moreover, you were a big hope to all cancer patients, including me.   Thanks for having lived in this world under the same sky with us, and I hope you to rest in peace from now.  God bless you!&nbsp;
Steve's legacy will remain and we will remember him forever. Tks for everything Steve!&nbsp;
Hello,   I'm a web developer from Iraq, I was deeply touched by this terrible news, and my prayers go to Steve's family and friends.  Thank you Steve for showing humanity that there is a better way to make things, a better way to see life, and for that I'm forever grateful.  RIP Steve.
Only once in a generation comes a man who changes the face of the world forever. You were one of those men.  You have been an inspiration and a role model to many and your presence will be sorely missed in this world.  May you find peace in your death but your name will live forever.&nbsp;
One of the most people I admired. R.I.P. Steve Jobs.
I cannot fully expresss how saddened I am by the loss of Steve Jobs.   I've been an Apple-ite for as long as I can remember and feel his vision, heart and tenacity will leave a gaping hole in our modern society.  He tapped into a realm of intuition, creativity and innovation preserved for the gods.   Jobs' legacy has permanantly changed the landscape of modern life - he will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
A great man who will be missed. Apple has changed my life and will continue to do so. I currently am a teacher who works with Apple computers daily. Every time Apple came out with new technology I felt that Jobs was in my head. Our students will miss him greatly. May God be with you and watch over your family.
Your legacy will be part of the human DNA forever.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs,  Thank you for everything ... wherever you are - YOU'LL NEVER WALK ALONE!  Grateful multiple Apple products user 
So sorry for your loss and I do hope that the company continues to exceed the leaps and bounds Steve started.&nbsp;
God bless you, Steve. You made a difference and are a national treasure. You  are greatly admired and respected by us all.  God bless you.
Your brilliance changed my life. Thank you.  With deep sympathy to your family, friends and employees,
He was a really wonderful man ,he had a mind full of ideas. We will  always remember him as the genius behind the Apple company. One day the  whole world will remember his name and no one will forget him. I am very  very sad about the loss. 
Although you do not know me or my family - I just want to say that our  thoughts and prayers are with you and your family during your time of  loss.  May God grant you peace and comfort during your time of need.
He was amazing to me even before I learned about him when I only knew of  him as the creator of Apple Inc . Starting Apple as well as  an other  computer/technology company as well as taking hold of Pixar is an  amazing set of feats.  The world really has lost an amazing human being, and Apple really has  lost a visionary and creative genius with true depth of vision.  May he rest in peace. 
It really is strange. I never met him. I only knew him from the products his company makes. The feeling of loss and emptiness I have is like when John Lennon was taken from us. It is a sad day for all of us. We must do our best to keep their visions in sight.  Steve Jobs will be missed and remembered for what he gave us.
Thanks, Steve, for making our lives less miserable.&nbsp;
Since 1995 I have purchased only Apple computing products because of   their design, beauty and reliability. We will truly miss this creative   genius who has given us so much. God rest his soul and console his   family.
Hi Steve, you are really great! May you rest in peace!!       
In as few words as possible thank you for changing this world for the better.
I wanna say that i'm really sorry  about this lost. Steve was a good professional and i'm sure that he was a good  man too.Thanks Steve you made a great Job!!!
Mr. Jobs remains an inspiration and a genius. Although I never knew him personally, from my first computer--the original blue gumdrop iMac--to the laptop that helped me get through two degrees, to the laptop I'm typing this on, I feel like I grew up with Mr. Jobs in a way.  But Mr. Jobs was more than the innovator behind Apple. While in the midst of over a dozen brain surgeries, I remember reading Mr. Jobs commencement address at Stanford where he discussed mortality among other things. While dealing with his own illness, Mr. Jobs articulated one of truths of life: "Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart." He succeeded wonderfully in doing exactly that and is a continuing inspiration to do the same.  My condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and his family at Apple.
Stay strong Apple, stay true to Steve's vision. 
 I was deeply sad just now, with news of the death of Steve Jobs.  Steve was a master, a wizard, a businessman and a father who, independent of their positions, had the respect and admiration of all.  Steve Jobs leaves us a smarter and beautiful world. He owned the gift of making things simple and build the fantastic and unimaginable.  Today, October 5th, the anniversary of my father, who left us 12 years ago, I know that heaven will become a better place.Rest in Peace Steve.&nbsp;
Of course I did not know him personally, as most of the people didn?t; but one thing is for sure: he influenced my life. His legacy is all the work he did, and Apple, Inc. a corporation based on quality is one will go through history as it revolutioned the music industry with the iPod, the netbook business with something much better: the iPad.    I live in Mexico City, I never met Mr. Jobs, but he influenced my life through his work and I?m sure humanity lost one agent of change and one genius.   To his family, my deepest condolences, I lost my father to brain cancer 4 months ago, he was 65 and I know what it feels like, but you have much power more than I to press the governments, the pharmaceutical companies and the scientific researchers to try harder and find a cure to this terrible disease that is an epidemic around the world.    Do your best, I'm doing mine.   Together we can change this world, if we try hard enough.&nbsp;
Thank you for teaching me all there is to know about technology. Without  Apple and Steve Jobs' innovations, who knows where I'd be. I think I  speak for so many when I say that Steve Jobs changed the world as we  know it.
To who ever will read this, Mr. Jobs will always be my idol. Thanks to him, I have wrapped my world around apple. He was truly a visionary and will be dearly missed. Over the past 2  years i have engulfed myself into learning all i can about apple and Steve J obs. I have written various papers about  him and his work in my high school  classes. His actions and words of true wisdom helped mold me into the perso n I am today. I wish I had the privelage to have met him, for I know he was such a remarkable man. Steve Jobs was my inspiration and hero and he will remain these things and much more to me for the rest of my life. I would like to give my condolences to his loved ones.&nbsp;
The world may consider Steve Jobs as one of the most influential       man of the millennium, the way I see it is that God's monopoly on creativity is threatened now with       Steve Jobs in his town.              
Steve Your contribution to the world will continue long after this day fades into memory. From the first keynote after your resignation you were missed, as much as you were during Apple's "lost" years. Those keynote presentations were as awesome as the products you championed. Rest in peace, Steve, but don't forget to look down and inspire your former colleagues to create beautiful things.&nbsp;
I send my condolences to all Apple family. Although I'm so far from you guys, I want to tell you that I really admired his genius thoughts and creations, and of course, his nice way to live every single day, with courage, strenght and simplicity. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
My condolences to all the Apple's staff. For me, Steve Jobs and you guys  changed the history of technology! Sad day. 
A day in October of 1998 I remember my dad saying he was going to get a computer. I was so excited as well as my other family members. We all browsed at the catalogs, I believe it was JC Penny &amp; I remember seeing these vibrant color machines. Little did I know those were the iMACS. I remember being so intrigued by them. I think it was because of the different colors it came in and I was pushing my dad to get the iMAC. We didn't get it, but it was ok because when I entered jr. high school the next year I got to experience one! It changed my outlook on technology. I just want to express how sad I am that we lost a visionary. I never met him, but through his passion I can feel that he had the be one of the nicest people. The man who inspired a generation to go beyond and not be afraid. Thank you Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Dear Steve, You may not know me - but you changed my life in 1984. I was 15.  People with  disabilities weren't in professions like computing - you gave me the gift of computing; programming and a livelihood. I now have a masters degree in info tech and I can't think of anything more I'd rather be doing. May every iPhone, iPad and future apple devices know your location.
My history with Apple goes back to the Apple IIGS. I also had a Newton. Steve Jobs death hurts me personally. I cannot tell you why but it just hurts.  I treat cancer patients as a Medical Oncologist and know of the struggle to live. Steve Jobs death is truly a loss to the world. It is the loss of a  friend, the memories are great but the loss is more. We as lovers of Apple  must not let the dream fail.  God bless and keep Steve Jobs and his family.&nbsp;
You have created a new way of life and a new image for our future.  We were lucky to have shared time watching the "apple" of your eye grow into your image.  You will be missed.&nbsp;
Steve, I do not know, but I think when humanity lost a genius, then yes we do, not minutes butdays of silence ... maybe we would learn a little. Thanks.
Amazing contribution to the world. Thank you. Never before and never again has someone revolutionized modern society….&nbsp;
Steve - I never graduated from Stanford, but I sure did listen to your profound speech that has permanently changed the way I think in my life.  You will be sorely missed by the entire world and you are such a great inspiration.  This is the true way to lead a life and I will strive very hard to lead one like that.  My deepest condolences to your family and all the close employees that you have treated like family.
My first introduction to Apple was from my younger brother and how 'cool'  the MAC was... then I caught 'the bug'.  Steve made computers, working  on them, playing on them and just researching as a whole-- a whole lotta  fun!  Thank you so much for your vision, your passion for your brand,  and for turning this person, so not a computer geek into an Apple  afficianado! Your spirit will live on in all who have your products and love each of  them so dearly-- you are true class! Much sadness... but gratitude.
Nothing more to say other than Steve will be missed by many people around the world. Most people would have to live 10 lifetimes to reach as many people as he did! &nbsp;
I began using an iMac at three years old... I remeber MacOS 9 Loading... I remember my draws on Clariswork .... I remeber my first iPod..My first iPhone... And now i will remeber forever the man that allowed me to become who i am... A Mac User.... I will always remeber You Steve... Everyone will.... you've been like a father for me and for the entire world... Just thanks for all of your hard job... We all miss u and will remeber you forever.&nbsp;
Because of you, we human beings now have RELIABLE digital companions. RIP Steve. You come back in 10 years, still your so called competitors will be behind you . THANK YOU&nbsp;
This news really touched me, and I hope his closest ones stay strong.  His empire, Apple, must keep on doing the great job of improving the  life on earth. Such a great man, who deserved more. He gave much to the world, now  its time for us to give back.Rest In Peace Steve Jobs, your name will be remembered. Condolences from Norway. 
Steve Jobs was a great man, if it had not been for him and Woz I would have not gotten into computers as a  career. But the Apple IIE changed many things, it changed my life and others. Rest in Peace Steve, you will not be forgotten. God bless you.
 Steve, You changed the world, you changed me. Thank you for allowing me to see the future through your eyes now. I miss you already.&nbsp;
Enjoy the conquest of new worlds Steve, you genius.  Apple forever!&nbsp;
Rest in peace, Steve.  I can't thank you enough. I use your product every single day for my design work.  You have changed our world for the better. Arigato, Steve. We will miss you. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to the Jobs family and his friends.&nbsp; The world has lost a special man.&nbsp; Silicon Valley has lost a legend.&nbsp; THANK YOU Steve for ALL the wonderful Apple products you have brought to this world.&nbsp; You leave a great legacy.&nbsp; You will be missed. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you for all the great products and changing the world.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs,   You created a company that I was proud to have worked for. With your vision of the Apple Retail Stores, your company not only provided for me monetarily but has enriched my life by providing me the opportunity to meet with my community. Your products were innovative and had a way of bringing people tog ether. Thank you for thinking different. &nbsp;&nbsp;
I am chilean woman, though I am far away, I feel so touched ... Steve has passed away but his gift to this world will always remain... Blessings...
I admired him greatly. I will pray for his family's healing during this difficult time.
People like Steve Jobs don't die because their legacy remains in time. RIP. Proudly writing from my iPhone.&nbsp;
Steve, Rest in peace. You are remarkable.<div><br></div><div>Thanks for your work on the technology done. You change our life, our world, and never to be forgetten. Your marks left on our desk, on our ears, and in our hands ! You are Legend ! I will miss you Forever !  Big fans in Hong Kong</div>
Jobs, You make the world different. Thank you. &nbsp;
 May he rest in peace.  Sending prayers for Mr. Jobs friends and family.   
    The only commnet I can make about Steve Jobs is that my old Apple IIc can still boot up. that speaks to the man and the technology he created.
A  sad day.  Having worked on and with computers since 1974 I have never found anything to match the grace and elegance of Apple products.  Steve Jobs was a genius for our time.  He will be sorely missed.  Our deep condolences to everyone fortunate enough to have known or worked with him. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs was not someone I knew, but knew of, and who affected our  world while he was alive and his passing affects us all now.  May those  who knew and loved him be consoled in the knowledge of what his legacy  will become. 
From the bottom of my heart, only three words... Thank you Steve!  R.I.P.
Thank You.
I want to express my sincere condolences to the family and friends of Steve.  I can only imagine the kind of person he was and you were all lucky to have  known him. You are all in my thoughts and prayers. Rest in peace Steve.
Today is the saddest day for those who love technology. The world has lost the most important creative of the last centuries. I have not had the fortune to meet Steve Jobs, but  I enjoy many of their creations that have revolutionized the world and will continue for many more years I'll see you Steve.&nbsp;
Today is a very sad day for the world. Steve was a mentor to everyone   that loves technology. Being in the graphics industry, my entire   family has been an Apple supporter for over 20 years, and we kick   ourselves every day because we've never bought stock...lol.  Even if you didn't agree with everything Steve did or how he did it,   it was undeniable that he was a genius in his field. His drive and   passion for what he loved to do was visible to all. To spend even one   day with Steve, I'm sure, was a dream for so many. It was for me.  Thank you Steve Jobs for not giving up on the future, for pushing   past being told "it can't be done!" Our faith is with Apple to   continue being innovative, however, we know NO ONE can replace you!  The world has their arms around the entire family at this most   difficult time. Our thoughts and deepest sympathy go out to them.&nbsp;
I had just recently become an Apple convert from Windows since the first  iPhone launched in 2007. One keynote from Steve and I saw the visionary  and heard the inspiring testimony of a man who truly believed he could  change the world for the better. He did just that and now I am a devoted  fan of Apple. My the spirit of Steve's innovation live long in the  company of Apple and let us not forget him. He will be missed greatly.
Even though everyone knew this day was coming, it's still heartbreaking! R.I.P.Steve, you truly were an innovator and a visionary... one can't put into words the loss this world has suffered with you gone. Thoughts and prayers with your family, friends, and everyone at Apple. Thank you for bringing us such great products, I'll always be an "Apple fan-boy"!
I remember the first time I held an iPod touch. it was sleek and very high-tech. What I will truly miss is the unvailings he would do everytime he came out with something new. Rest in peace genius Jobs, your finger tips have rocked this world into a new generation.    
Thank you and RIP you will be forever missed
Prayers and thoughts with the Jobs family, his close friends, Apple Corp, and the world. His vision has changed everyday life for me and many other people on the planet. Thank you for sharing your gift of vision with the world.&nbsp;
I am truly shocked that such an incredible human being has passed away. He revolutionized the way we interact with technology, and that’s the perfect reason to not forget his name. I share my most sincere condolences for the family and for those who knew him well. His legacy shall live forever.
I've never met you but I feel like I know you.  I am truly lost right now.  You have changed more in my life than anyone else I have personally known.  I will miss you until the end of time.
Steve Jobs was the Leonardo da Vinci of our times.
What can I say about Steve that hasn't already been said.  Genius.  Thanks for the products that changed my life and the world.  Thanks for everything!!!  Thanks for inspiring me to get an education in business and management and to think differently.    May Steve rest in peace.    My best to all his family and friends.&nbsp;
My thoughts &amp; prayers are with his family. We have lost a great visionary, one of the most influential person in the tech industry.   
I am deeply saddened by your loss.  You were one of the rare individuals  that truly made the world a better place.  You were innovative and your  creations were just plain fun!.  You will be missed.  God Bless you 
You are one of a few true visionary in our time. We will remember you  forever. Now, you are free from all earthly burdens. R.I.P in heaven. 
You and Woz changed the world. Thank You and rest in peace.   
 Mis mas profundo dolor ante una perdida inmensa              
I may be wrong because the Japanese wording. I'm sorry. You are longing for me, was a pioneer who changed the following lifestyle. Now, Apple's products are full of personal belongings. Is very happy, and send a fun day. IPone4S became the final product, I decided to buy. Thank you for the wonderful force. We will make an effort closer to you too. Goodbye, Steve Jobs 
 Steve was an amazing man. only he could do what he did with Apple, he was a genius, he had wonderful ideas and all people that knows that, will be sorry about that loss. From my heart, i only can say "The world lost a great person"&nbsp;
Steve &amp; Jobs are the two words which connected me to Technology.   And  those are the same two words which make me sad today.  Insanely hard to  imagine that steve is no more but he will continue to live forever.  I am deeply shocked for the news.  It is harder than it seemed, to  digest.  I will forever continue to see Steve in all the products his  company makes! &nbsp;I will really admire Apple if it continues to be the Icon's company ! Rest in Peace, Steve.  I am one in the billion who will always remember  you.&nbsp;
Great men may die, But their legacy lives on forever. R.I.P Steve jobs. My dearest condolences for his friends and family. God is gonna have a blast playing Happy Birds in heaven. One more light has darkened the world. R.I.P Mr. Jobs 
I believe Steve Jobs was one of the most influential men in History. It  was through his ideas and ambition that Apple and Pixar became the  leader in technology today. I will always remember him in both his  character and the tools he left behind to build a better world. God  bless Steve Jobs and may he rest in the peace he deserves. 
My heart goes out to the family and friends of Steve Jobs. The world has just lost one of the greatest technological innovators of our time. His legacy will not be forgotten.
Truly an icon in technology. He will always be THE Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is my idol and always will be. I am a 14 year old teen who  has wanted a mac since I was 8 and saved up 3 years for a macintosh. 
As a professor of computer science I hold Steve Jobs up as a true visionary , responsible not only for creative innovation, but also really cool stuff. I am deeply saddened by our loss. Our industry will never be quite the same.       "The average four-year-old asks three hundred questions a day. The average college graduate asks twenty."    
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO CHANGED AND IS AFFECTING THE WORLD. YOU ARE SPECIAL.YOU ARE UNIQUE.YOU ARE HONORED.YOU ARE THE ONE. THANK YOU AND GOODBYE.
I am so sorry to hear that Steve Jobs has passed away. I could not even express my thoughts that go out to his family and loved ones. The world is a better place because of him. I guess heaven needed him to upgrade their IT dept. My Condolences.
My biggest condolences to the friends and family of Steve. His Stanford Commencement Speech changed my life, he will be greatly missed. 
There are some days that make the world change. The day that Steve Jobs raised Apple changed everyones world. Today, we all become a little less creative, a little less bright...a little lost. My sincere condolences to the family: Jobs' and Apple's.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  Thanks a lot, many many many dreams.
Steve Jobs dared to see above and beyond everyone else and for that he changed the history of mankind.&nbsp;
He was a great person, and he will be missed.  He made life easier for millions with his products.  He will not be forgotten.  Our family has purchased many Apple products and without them life would be impossible.  I just wish I  had the opportunity to meet this amazing person before passed away.
Years ago a company started, and from that moment on the whole world has changed forever. Years ago back to the days in college I said to each and every friend Apple is the future. Years ago when I am a student Steve and his experience that I read and heard about has inspired me through the gloomiest days and finally to success. Steve, you have inspired me like no one has ever did before. I believe Heaven must be full of creativity with you, and your inspiration is sure to be immortal in each and every one's heart. Steve you have inspired me and guided the direction of my life.  
Bye, Steve. Thanks a zillion for what you did to the world...
Steve,  You will be missed but never forgotten.  I just want to thank you on  a personal note.  It might not be much to apple but you have help my lil guy with his speech and his ever day learning. The iPad is something  that has  change his world.
Steve,   God bless you and Thank You for what you have done. You have changed the world for ever.
Steve, Words cannot describe what you have meant to us and our children. You have left this place a far more entertained and educated than it was before you. May you rest on your iCloud.  Thank you!&nbsp;
We will miss you so much Steve Jobs! You have offered so much to the  world and the people on this planet. I will never forget about your  vision for how people interact with each other on a more personal level  and that ethic has shone through the products at Apple.  I wish you could read this.  Adios amigo. 
Great creator, the world will miss Steve Jobs. My sympathies to the  family.
I think we must all thank Mr Jobs for his persistence in bringing his imagination to life.  Imagination is key to innovation and advancing as a society, Steve was both a dreamer and a mechanic.  He will be missed. 
 I was really shocked to hear about Mr. Jobs.  I've admired him and loved all of the innovations that Steve and the entire Apple family has given us.  Thank you Mr. Jobs and I know you're in a much better place because you help make my world and the world of my students a better place.  We love you! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Without Steve Jobs, the world would not be in the informative era that it is now in. Thank you Steve Jobs, for all of your incredible contributions to human life and development. 
I always wanted to meet this man in person and i just wanted to say   that those who knew this man were very fortunate. R.I.P.    Steve god   is with you!! 
 Thanks for a professional life exquisitely lived … may you find mercy and peace, Steve Jobs
<div>This is from Korea. I really just want to honor him and thank him for all the great work he has done. I think he is the best inventor so far, and I really admire his inventive brain. I really loved all the inventions dearly such as iPod Touch, iPod Nano, iPad, MacPro, MacAir, Apple TV, Apple wifi connector, iPhone! and the company, Apple. I want to say thank you for the great work in the USA and to the world. I am sure I'm not the only one from Korea who think you are the best. All my friends and I are going to miss you and your great work.</div>
I wake up to go on my MacBook Pro, turn on iTunes. Get out the door,  while listening to my iPod Touch. I finally get to class just to pull  out my iPad. If that description of my day doesn't show his impact on my  life... A true genius died today.  R.I.P Steve Jobs
Today is a sad day for all Apple fans around the world (including myself).  The moment I read the article about his passing, I was shocked and saddened.  He was a visionary and a creative genius who made the revolution happen in this world.  He invented the greatest innovations throughout history.  As a computer technician and a recent university grad, I would like to say Steve Jobs will always be technology's chosen one.  I may not know him personally, but it feels as I did meet him.  He may be gone from this world, but will never be forgotten from our hearts.  He will always remembered by your fantastic innovations people are carrying today.  From MacBooks to iPhones, we will remember him as an amazing inventor from present and beyond.  Rest in Peace, Mr. Steve Jobs  
Deep condolence to his family.  You have lost a great person.  Run to God for comfort and peace. 
 As much as I dislike APPLE hardware I really do respect a man with so much innovation and Steve was such an intelligent man. He has done so much with Apple I would not be surprised if we never see such a man in our life time.  RIP Steve              
Steve for me was an amazing mentor and guide, Im truly sad, and Steve wherev er you are, in Mexico there are a lot of people wo will always admire you.&nbsp;
My sincere thanks for all your creations, you gave wings to my dreams. I'll never forget. R.I.P. Steve.&nbsp;
Steve will be remembered for his brilliance, passion and talent. His  innovative work has inspired and influenced a lot of people. He is an icon.  Steve, rest in peace.&nbsp;
Hoy murió una de las mejores personas del mundo, una gran mente que revolucionó la forma en que vivimos. Te recordaremos como "un gran hombre" Steve Jobs; porque tú eres merecedor del título.&nbsp;
Thank you Mr. Jobs for changing the world, bringing people closer, and  blanketing the world with technology, information, and hope! &nbsp;
An amazing visionary and entrepreneur.  To his mourning family and friends, even when we know death is absolute, we are never ready for the journey.  He left an imprint in our world, and he will always be remembered.&nbsp;
It is sad to here of the passing of Steve Jobs . Rarely during our   lives are there men like Steve that unbeknown to him offer such   inspiration to the world . We are blessed for having him here during   our lives. May he rest in Peace . <br>
RIP Steve, enjoy the iclouds, My condolences to your family.  Thank you!&nbsp;
I am so thankful for all the work Steve Jobs has done.  He was a genius and the world lost its most creative person.  My thoughts and prayers go to his family, friends, and of course everyone at Apple.&nbsp;
To Mr. Jobs' Family &amp; The Apple Family ~  There are no words to express the sadness and the profound loss the world is feeling this evening. You can't even begin to replace a person who has touched so many people in this world. I smile as I look around at my MacBook, my Mac Pros, my iPad, iPhone and countless other Apple products that are a true part of my life. These are not just products but they are woven into the fabric of each day of my life. I work on them, play with them, live with them.  My heart goes out to his family for this indescribable loss. May you rest in peace, Steve Jobs.  We will carry on down here in your absence. You will truly be missed.  If anyone could find a way to inspire from beyond, I'm sure you will!&nbsp;
Thanks, Steve. I wish you could have received all of this specific   love in your waking lifetime. Yesterday. Two days ago. All of it. All   of it. Look how the world respects and mourns you. I wish that your   inbox, voicemail, mailbox could have been flooded, full, overflowing   with the words that everyone is expressing tonight while you were   still able to see them, hear them, read them, feel them.  Thanks for what you have built, thanks for how you have bettered my   life. I'm so sorry for not thanking you yesterday.
The saddest day i have seen to all the apple employees friends family and colleagues of Mr Steve Jobs my heart goes out to you all. A visionary, a dreamer but most of all a daring man.  May he be remembered for what he did for us all&nbsp;
I want to thank Steve for changing the world. He made life better for  millions perhaps billions. My 11 year old son said "oh no" when he heard  and was truly saddened--what other CEO could have elicited such a  reaction? When you get down on America, just think of Steve Jobs--as he  embodied what is so great about our nation.&nbsp;
I remember when I got the 1st iPod and was amazed (I still am) and how I could put 20,000 songs on it from my music collection and go.  Almost 10 years later,  the iMac, iPhone and the iPad are everyday tools my family use for work and play.  Steve Jobs has made a tremendous impact on my life and many others all over the world and he will be missed.  My daughter (who is 3 now and loves the iPad) will learn about him in her history class and I think his creative genius has not been completely appreciated but as time marches on, his contributions will exceed many of those who came before him.  God bless the Jobs family and may Steve rest in peace :)&nbsp;
Today we lost one of the greats of our time. &nbsp;His revolutionary ideas and ingenuity made Apple a household name. He was a brilliant mind and will be missed. &nbsp;My condolences to all who knew and loved him. Rest in Peace, Godspeed
Not knowing him I shed involuntary tears at the news of his death. Not one to embrace fads, or idolize public figures I must admit he conquered a great deal in his life. He designed a way of experiencing life through technology that seduced us all and defined playful paradigms that altered the way we think about the digital realm. What moved me the most was the public expression of his ultimate conquest.  A  brilliant, sophisticated mind, at times arrogant but always inspiring, humbly coming to terms with his own fragility while leaving behind an undeniable  legacy of excellence. Thanks Steve.
I will never forget when I first heard of Apple Computer. It was 1981 and I was a young stockbroker. I found the company intriguing and by accident realized that Steve and I shared the same birthdate....February 24th. I bought Apple Computer the next day and continue to hold the shares today. Now many years later, I have come to realize that this chance discovery truly transformed my life. I am eternally grateful for all Steve Jobs has done for humanity and look forward to my belief that I will see him again. My prayers are with Steve and his family.&nbsp;
Dear Apple and those closes to Steve Jobs,      My deepest sympathies goes out to all those that were close to him. He will be truly missed and will always be remembered by all that knew him, knew of him, and shared his passion for innovation. He truly was a visionary man with a remarkable intuition of  today's technology. Today a very sad thing had happened.&nbsp;
What set Steve apart to me, as a devoted Apple fan, is that he was on the side of his customers: his goal was to create great products that would delight and amaze us, and he achieved that goal time after time. I'm sure there was much more to him than that, but that is what meant the most to me. He was one of a kind. 
There is nothing much left to say. Steve Jobs really did impact me and many others. It changed the way many things are done and changed the way many people think and act. Sending an email from my MacBook, making a call from my iPhone, watching a  movie from my Apple TV, listening to music from my iPod and looking at pictures on my iPad, nothing would have been possible if it wasn't for you. &nbsp; Thank you Steve Jobs for living and being the person you have been! You have made my life both easier and more colourful! Rest in peace Steve Jobs, you earned it!&nbsp;
 It's hard to believe he's gone. After so much he has battled and went through the past years, he has still made Apple the best company in the world. He  will be forever remembered! God bless his family and friends!&nbsp;
Rest in peace Mr. Jobs.  Condolences goes out to your family.  Thank you for your incredible contributions to society.&nbsp;
I am 58 and have been using Macs since they first came out. I have always admired Steve Jobs, even when I wasn't sure how to  pronounce his last name. But it didn't matter. Steve created a new consciousness with his vision  and it is still there, now grown and ruling the world! There are many like me and we will carry on and carry his sweet memory  in our hearts. Thank you, my friend. Bless your heart and your family.
Steve's vision, determination and quest for perfection created a community, desired by many and open to all .... A great loss &nbsp;
    I found myself really surprised about the sad feeling I just got, for me a regular guy from a small city in Colombia, how didn't ever meet Steve is weird to be feeling down. But I guess part of he's genius was the ability of making himself loved by the people how actually love the company's products. Good bye Steve, and thanks.   
I'm a 47 year old man… combat vet… Machead since 1995 and am crying. Goodbye, Steve, and thank you.
I am deeply saddened by the loss of one of the greatest visionaries who ever  lived. Steve has changed the lives of many, including myself. He will always be remembered. RIP Steve Jobs.
I have been an Apple gal since my first blueberry imac, and have never  looked back. I had the coolest, fastest and easiest to operate computer  of all my friends, and I was 'cool'. Fast forward to now, my family has  everything from G3 Ibooks (kids play on them) to G4 iMacs to my 2  macbook pros. We have iPhones and iPads and iPods, and everything in our  world just works. The man who spoke about these products with love and  enthusiasm, in jeans resonated and related with me. He was approachable.  We talked about Jobs as if we knew him, and I am sure most of us would  have loved to have had 10 minutes of his time, just to have a casual cup  of joe. Our prayers are with him and his family, and we will all miss the life  and legacy of Steve Jobs.
... no words to describe... Please keep his dream alive... 
You have touched my life beyond words.  I will miss you, but you will always be in my heart and thoughts.  Thank you for your inspiration.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve, for making our lives a little better and brighter! Forever Loyal Apple Fans
Steve jobs, oh how do i explain how you've changed the world?...i can't. My heart goes out to the close ones of such a great soul. May you rest in eternal peace, i pray for the loved ones, the creative and darling man steve jobs you may have passed, but your name will be engraved in the world of innovation and technology and remembered by everyone.&nbsp;
Dear Steve, I saw this heartbreaking news soon after I got up. Thanks for introducing me  the amazing world of Apple and I will cherish everything I've learned from you to make the world better. Thanks again Steve. You are really my inspiration and I will remember you forever.
Dear Steve,    We will miss you very much.  You have been a shining beacon of light not only during our life time but for generations and generations to come.  Your light will shine and inspire the thoughts and minds of countless millions whose life you have touched through with your passion for perfection and genius.  Rest in peace!&nbsp;
just can't believe it. The world lost Steve Jobs. There is no other way to put it. The world lost Steve Jobs.  Can you imagine where we would be without him? He truly changed the world. Thank You! R.I.P Steve  Sent from my beautiful iMac "… the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.” - Steve Jobs 
I am lucky and blessed to have seen, have touched and have experienced true magical genius in my lifetime.    For the company that I truly love and respect may you continue to fill your halls, offices and board room with his spirit.   For the man that I deeply admired and respected for all his qualities, may you rest in peace, thank you for your contributions to the world and god bless your friends &amp; family. With deepest condolences.
As an educator I will miss his vision and inspiration.  The world has  lost a great man and I will pray for his safe passage.  I will miss him  and am very sad, but his work and vision will live on through all those  that embrace his ideals and work ethic.  Rest in peace. 
I've used Macs for longer than I'd like to think about for creating  music. I wouldn't be where I am today career-wise without Macs and the  ease with which they (and Logic) help me create my music. My condolences  to his family. Thank you for sharing Steve with us. 
I will miss him. A genius. My first computer was an Apple II. My respects to his family.
My prayers go up to you and your family. A truly inspirational and amazing human being with limitless knowledge. Hope you find peace with God sir.&nbsp;
He was a pioneer,visionary  and a creative genius.He will be missed by   all.RIP
Dear Steve,  You were my inspiration although we never met face to face. I dreamed of shaking your hand. Now I cannot accomplish that dream, but your spirit remains within my heart. Today I feel deeply saddened and feel a hole in my heart, but I know your were much loved and that you are in good hands now.  Thank you for being who you were, the tech world has lost its biggest treasure of this era. I will always have you in my heart.&nbsp;
When I first saw his presentation of iPhone 3GS, I couldn't take my eyes off him for the whole presentation. His voice, motions, the charisma, was just incredible. I watched over and over the same presentation that week. Now, the person I saw through the computer monitor is not here anymore. I will miss you, Mr. Jobs.
Dear Mr. Steve jobs,  I received sudden news of death. At news of death, I show a condolence heartily. It is management and a technique of superb Apple &amp; Macintosh, and Steve Jobs is a really splendid human being. Really thank you. I am really lonely. Apple &amp; Macintosh please be strongly valid forever from now on. I support Apple &amp; Macintosh, too.  I pray that it is passed away peacefully by Steve Jobs.  I pray a family of Mr. Steve Jobs for health and happiness heartily.&nbsp;
No words are enough to express my sadness over the passing of the greatest visionary of our time. You shown to us that one man can make a difference.  Thank you Steve for changing the world for us and may you Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
I am a 16 year old from rural Illinois who has been devastated by the loss of the one individual who has influenced my life without even trying. I strive for excellence, just as Steve did in all of his work. I am blunt about my opinions, just as Steve was in just about everything. I am hardworking because I know that is the only way I can hope to be a fraction of as influential as Steve was on the world and popular culture. This man has touched so many lives with his innovations, and he couldn't have imagined how much he will be missed. Farewell to the world's most inspiring innovator and creative genius.&nbsp;
Dear  Steve,      RIP and thank you for your huge creation.&nbsp;
thank you steve for changing the way we interact with our world. 
Thanks Steve for your genius. May you Rest in Peace.  My life has been significantly enhanced since the moment my dad bought me my first Mac Plus to today when I can write this on my iPad 2, with so many amazing Apple products in between. The whole world owes a massive debt of thanks to Steve for his vision and creativity.   Condolences to all at Apple and to the Jobs family.
My deepest condolences to Steve's family and the Apple team. Steve will always be a great inspiration for the world.  Siempre serás un modelo de excelencia, visión y calidad humana.  Rest in Peace.
Steve Jobs,  Thank you for your vision, execution, collaboration and believing in   yourself enough to change the world by introducing what we hereto for   have never dreamed. You changed the world for the better, while   remaining true to yourself, your vision and the Apple brand.  I respect who you were, what you did and most important what you   challenge me to be: the same as you. I will try to live up my performance   of vision in my respective endeavors.  R.I.P. Steve Jobs, GOD needed some new ideas...&nbsp;
Some of the objects that define the culture and everyday lives of our world today just wouldn't be if it wasn't for that one man with the courage to pursue the things that he truly loves. Steve's passion will remain among us, impressing and inspiring, his ideas will greatly endure. Sincere condolences to the family and closest friends.&nbsp;
You are my hero. Rest in peace.
We have all lost a great person.  My condolences to Mr Jobs's family. An APPLE user since the early 80's.&nbsp;
It is a privilege to be in the times when you lived, the genius you were, in technology related to music, movies, computing or communication. You will be greatly missed. You are now a part of history where great inventors like Leonardo, Edison and you, Steve will be recognized for innovation, simplicity and sheer genius for the objects you provided to the world.&nbsp;
He always regretted the death of a human being ... but when it comes to a genius gives the impression that humanity is a little orphan. Being a contemporary of yours makes me proud.Thank you for having made life easier and I wish God's love be with you throughout your new life.  Thanks Steve! God bless you.
Though I never had the opportunity of meeting Steve Jobs, I felt (along  with many others) that I knew him. Growing up with Apple, Steve was  always the face &amp; visionary for the company and my perception of him was  that he was casual yet confident and honest with what he believed in. As  a young entrepreneur his confidence, tremendous vision and dedication to  his Company was inspiring for myself and many others. My condolences to  his family and loved ones.
He changed our lives in so many ways- I am only happy that I lived at  the same time he did.  Let us celebrate his life and what he did for  ours.
This man was the singlehandedly biggest influence in consumer  electronics today. Although I am only 16, this man has had a big impact  on me. I have had the pleasure of doing a biography on him. He is one of  the biggest innovators in the world if not the biggest. I hope he rests  in peace he damn well deserves it. RIP one the biggest innovators in the  world as we know it Steve Jobs.
My condolences to your family and friends. Thank you for all that your vision has done to enhance my life and the lives of others. Your ability to see true value in the intangible has enriched us all as human beings.&nbsp;
Steve, you will never be forgotten. &nbsp;
I never saw you, never talked to you, but I always listened. You changed the way I think in many aspects, you changed my life, my goals are now sky high because you made me believe that if we try and we love what we want, we can achieve our goals.  So now that you are gone I just feel the pain, the pain I never thought someone's death could hurt so much, even if never met. Every time we check the email, take a picture, share our musings on the internet or make a call you will come to our memories.  For ever and ever. I promise I will stay hungry and foolish...  Thanks a lot, Steve... 
to the family of Steve Jobs -  My deepest sympathy. Steve changed the world forever. He added so much to my life. May he rest in peace.
We will always remember you as the man who change the technology world. Now rest in peace.  We will miss you.
he did soo much more then make phones and entertainment. he made lives easier and simpler and I send my sincere condolences to any and all family members. 
My husband passed away in february 6th, he used to watch in you tube almost every day Steve´s lecture at Stanford. He had never smoker lung cancer and he was like Steve a genius in his field (as a lawyer and as a politician). He really admired Steve´s strong battle with cancer like my husband was doing.  We used to share every day a poem that i want to share with you people and all the families in the world who are fighting against this desease. INVICTUS Out of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody, but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade, And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid. It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul.   
My thoughts and prayers to his family and friends.&nbsp;
There are not many that touch my soul when they die, but Steve Jobs has. I'm sorry for your loss, his families loss and the world loss.     Brokenhearted. 
Steve Jobs embedded himself into history.  When I think of how Steve Jobs w ill be remembered I think of when I was in school learning about the great  innovators throughout time.  Generations of people after us, years from now  will learn about how Steve Jobs changed the world.  I'm just happy that I  was along for the ride!  RIP&nbsp;
Steve will always remind me what it means to live life to the fullest. I will never forget what he has taught me. <br>
As I sit in front of my 21" Mac screen, I am shedding many tears.  Every time I had the chance to see Steve on television, I was in utter awe of this man, this magician.  How could a human being have so many visions, and then the tenacity to make those dreams come to life;  not for him, but for the world!  He made our troubled world a better place, and for this, his hard work will live forever, and there will never ever again be another person who comes close to Steve Jobs   Thank you Steve, Good Night, and God Bless You. &nbsp;
You have given  wonderful thing to world, you are wonderful person, thanks for everything. You will be in our hearts forever.
 He showed all of us that the little guy CAN beat the big bullies in spite of great odds. Thanks Steve.
I believed in Steve 30 years ago and I will never stop believing in him, I am saddened and the world has truly lost a unique passionate visionary, a one of a kind.&nbsp;
 Greatest Steve,    Your creation has made not only the teens, adult and even the elderly connect to the world of IT with lots of ease...    You help to bond family closer and make their life full of colours...me and my family is one of the beneficial to all these....THANK YOU TO YOU   Sending my deepest condolence...    You will be remember by the world for a long long time...&nbsp;
Steve Jobs will live forever in all those things  that reflect his genius and  make our lives simpler, naturally.     
Steve,  The single-most thing you left behind for the world? INSPIRATION.  You touch our souls by the power of human imagination and ambition.  We'll not forget. Nor will generations to come. RIP
I can't speak English fluently.   But I have to send a message, because Steve is my mentor and I respect him very much.  I'm very shocked now and very sorrowed.  I'll miss you forever and thank Steve.  
In the end the Love you take is the Love you make. They say you can't take it with you. Thanks Steve for leaving so much of yourself behind for the rest of us.
The Mac and I were born the same year, and since my father has been on  the bandwagon since day one, every Mac since has been a huge part of my  life (and now iPods, iPhones, etc.). In a way, Apple has always felt  like a member of the family, and I think Steve deserves all of the  credit for elevating a tech company to such an incredible status.  He is an inspiration and will be missed dearly. I hope it brings some  comfort to his own family that he has touched so many people.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the first man to ever get me involved in computers. He made me think that it really wasn't as bad as people made it sound. At the age of 17 and in my senior year of high school I am planning on going to college to study computer science and computer engineering. This was made possible by the inspiration Steve has given me.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs, thank you Sir for all that you have done.
As a first year college student at UCLA, Steve Jobs has always been an  inspiration to me to pursue my business ideas and to help people  throughout the world.  He leaves behind quite a legacy. 
   They said that everybody remembers where they were and what they´d been doing when JFK was pronounced dead: the shock was so intense that could´t be forgotten.  But I wasn´t born then, I came tho this world in a different era. I was nine years old when Apple II arose, and twelve when Apple Lisa -with mouse and desktop, before no one knew anything like that-, and tonight I am writing this in a Macbook, which keyboard is being tapped with my fingers and my own tears.  This guy created a great part of my today´s world.  I'm in shock, and I never forget this very moment.  When a creator of an age leaves the world, the rest of us realize that nothing will be the same. And nothing will be. Farewell Steve, best journey.
For years and years I got inspired with Apple solutions as Apple user.   During these years, I always imagine Steve's image on each product that Apple has produced.     I can't believe that he is gone, but he is leaving behind an amazing revolution.   Big Loss!&nbsp;
You will be missed - hope it was painless and peaceful.
You know guys, I'm an only 18 year old university student, inspirited by Steve, when he left Apple I took the picture of the newspaper and saved it in my wallet. I can go on and on, but now... He's gone and he still will be my inspiration, a great man, I'll always remember him, not only like the founder of Apple, even more I'll remember his story and tell to my sons who was he, and what a person he use to be. Thanks a lot and I hope the best for the company more than ever.
Thank You Steve you are one of the best dreamers I ever been, thank you to be an example.
Im really sorry about this loss, my condolences to his family. I only new about Steve Jobs Apple's life and I realize will be too difficult find other visionary apple person like him, but I only hope his apple work never lost his essence without him. An I know in heaven going to be happy because from now Angels will have better computers and cell phones than us.
Steve Jobs has changed our world. He has changed our music, the way we communicate, the way we receive information. He has changed the way the world goes round. Steve may have left us, but he truly will never be gone. At this very moment ... He is in our homes. He is with us on our commutes and travels. He with us as we mourn him. He is everywhere. And his legacy will never be missed because his presence emanates *everywhere* 
I just wanted to say that as a television professional Steve Jobs and Apple had a profound impact on my career and life. My first computer I received as a kid was an Apple IIc and my love for Apple and it's products grew from there. Later on in life as I entered the world of t.v., Final Cut Pro helped reach my goals, I used it when it was first launched and I still use it today. &nbsp;It was a dream of mine to someday work for Apple, in it's retail stores or at the corporate environment, because I knew the love and loyalty his employees felt for his company and Mr. Jobs himself. I know Mr. Jobs touched many lives and in many different ways. The world is a better place for having had him in it. May god bless you all. To Mr. Jobs I say, Thank You. You will be missed.
  Always &amp; Forever A Steve Jobs fan. Always &amp; Forever an Apple Girl.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs.. A genius! Inspired many. He changed the whole meaning of technology. I was totally fascinated by his thoughts, vision and this day, I feel very sorry.  May your soul rest in peace. <br>
the apples to changed the world, apple to adam, apple to newton and apple to steve jobs 
Steve was an extraordinary person. He changed the world as well as my little world. He was my role model. Even though I didn't know him personally he meant a lot to me. I know his genius will continue, but it wont be the same without the one who created it, the mastermind. It's very sad he couldn't see his latest creation go out to the public the iPhone 4S. My heart goes out to the family of Steve and to his co-wokers as they have suffered a greater loss then I have as they are closer to him. May Steve Jobs REST IN   PEACE. 
After hearing Mr. Jobs enthusiastically explain the IPad 2, I decided to buy  it.  I am so glad I got a chance to be influenced by this genius who was so  excited about his products.  I praise God for him.  I pray for his family and hope that he truly rests in peace.  He helped so many people and made complicated technology easy to use.&nbsp;
just wanted to express my admiration for a man that performed miracles  in ICT and consumer electronics, not to mention e-commerce.
I'll just repeat my Facebook status as I am speechless otherwise.&nbsp;  An amazing person has left earth today and as I'm typing this on my iPad and checking my iPhone and my Mac computer for news on him I cannot help but think of how thankful I am for him and his amazing inventions.
Not many human beings can say that they changed the way that people  think in a positive way to benefit humanity. While Steve Jobs did not  save lives, he certainly gave us many means of making our lives easier,  happier &amp; more productive.  I am grateful to be free of the headache that is Windows. I am grateful that we have a better choice in technology that constantly  strives to push the envelope. I am grateful to have a simplified 'all-in-one' device that is more than  I could've ever dreamed of.  Godspeed, Steve. Godspeed. 
My heart is sad tonight. We have lost a true visionary. The world is a less interesting place without Steve in it. Thank you for all gifts you brought us.   
Steven Paul Jobs was more than an icon; more than an innovator. Steve was a revolutionist within the industry that knew how to think outside of it. He was my hero. I've never had the opportunity to meet him or attend an Apple event, but I can say without a doubt that the man made a difference in my life and the lives of many of my friends. I hope that Apple will continue to honor his vision and inspire generations to come to Think Different, just as Steve would have wanted.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a visionary and an inspiration. His contributions will be  missed and his memory will be cherished. 
Steve and his vision filled my life with Joy and Delight. The excitement of his keynotes will be replayed in my memory for all time. I will continue to Think Different.  Condolences to his family and the family at Apple, Inc. and to us all as the planet feels a little less magical tonight.
Oi,  Steve, só queria dizer que suas palavras e força de vontade foram e sempre serão fonte inesgotavel de inspiração para mim.   Meu abraço e minhas orações ficam para você e sua familia neste momento tão duro que é a passagem desta existencia.  Sentirei sua falta.  Nunca será esquecido por tudo que foi e representa.  Que o criador o receba de braços abertos.  Você merece.   Muito obrigado.
Goodbye Steve. I never knew you, but I felt like I did. I use the things that you created in my home, at work, and everything else I do every day. I talk to my wife through your phone. I see my baby girl's photos on your computer. I can visit with my family 1500 miles away with facetime. It's like magic.
For giving us technology that we could actually get excited about. You changed the world. We will miss your innovative spirit.&nbsp;
What I remember most was the day I put my two years baby girl on my   lap playing Classic II, she is twenty years old now and a complete   Macintosh user, it is no surprise she purchased ipad 2 and awaiting   for iphone 4s. You are missed Steve, most of all, thank you for taking   my hand indirectly to the world of Macintosh, so much to learn, so   easy and so effective. Think different is Mr. Steve Jobs. 
Thank you so much Steve for everything you have made and shown us, from Apple II to iPad and your mentor of being good human being against Israel.  God bless you.Thanks so much, brother.&nbsp;
I am very sorry to hear about Steve Jobs. He was such a wonderful  visionary with a gift who opened the eyes of many with the products he  envisioned and implemented for us. He changed the world for all of us  and I can't picture a day without an Apple product. It's because of him  that we are able to communicate easier, and keep in touch with friends  and family from close to far distances. My condolences go out to his  friends, family, and loved ones.
Teenagers aren't really amazed by much these days. I know that because I am one.  It takes a great deal of hard work, effort, persistence, creativity, and above all genius, to give the world something that 16 year olds respond to with enthusiasm. Steve Jobs was the hard worker with the effort, persistence, creativity, and genius that delivered to us apathetic teenagers something really extraordinary, something we could gossip and be excited about.  I can recount memories of exactly what I was doing and where I was when Steve Jobs used his incredible marketing and presentation savvy to launch products we didn't know we needed until Steve gave them to us.  My life has changed because of Steve Jobs' genius. I am the owner of a Mac, a Macbook, and recently, an iPhone 4. Every member of my family, from the eldest to me, the youngest, has and is in love with an iPhone. My father was first in line for the original iPod, all the iPhones, and both iPads. My family and household run on Apple technology.  20 years from now, I can't imagine how I'll begin to explain to my children what kind of an impact Steve Jobs had on not only my and my family's lives, but the world itself.  Steve Jobs's products connected the world. It became an iFamily.  May the greatest innovator of our time, someone who embodied the true American spirit, rest in peace.  My family and I offer our condolences to those close to Steve Jobs, and will continue to support Apple and all of the company's future endeavors.
   We would like to express our deepest sympathy to the family of Steve.     May he rest in peace.  
Steve Jobs was a genius, a visionary and an incredible marketer. He brought so much joy to the world through innovative products that have become an indelible part of our lives. He was and will always be a role model in my life.  Rest in peace, Steve. My condolences to his family, friends and colleagues.&nbsp;
I thank him for this innovation and vision he has shared with us all. He  will be sorely missed. Sad day, please keep up the good work in his memory. Thank you Steve. 
I have been an Apple-fanboy ever since iTunes released and I begged my dad to get the latest iPod. Then Came the iPad, MacBook, iPod touch, and now the iPhone. But one thing every purchase I made had in common was when my parents  would ask me "why do you need it?" My reply has always been the same, "I just do." Now I'm only 15 but I can still appreciate the love and care Steve Jobs put into every Apple product, and only hope that I have such drive and determination for perfection and excellence that I could only make myself an inch of the great heights Steve Jobs has gone.
The world is a much different and better place.  Thank you for the time we had.  Steve Jobs will be remembered by generations that have yet to be born.  May he rest in peace.
Aside from my own parents, there is probably no one in this world who impacted my life more than Steve Jobs. His company and its products allowed me to pursue a career I never would have been able to do without him. But just like Steve always looked to the future, I will move forward, just a little sadder.&nbsp;
A figure of faith, and a trust that he made us to built on Apple Inc., will never die! Steve., we will miss you..!&nbsp;
Another moment  where I will always remember where I was when I heard the  news. &nbsp;The moon landing; Elvis; John Lennon; and now Steve Jobs. &nbsp;My working life has been defined by his products and his vision: he was my  "friend" and mentor: now he has gone. &nbsp;I  am devastated. &nbsp;
Today the world lost an icon!  Steve it's a winner, he was born like that and even for those who thought differently, time proved they were wrong.  He overcame the rejection of the parents! He overcame the lack of money! He overcame the lack of ideas! He surpassed the cut of his wings!  Even exiled from his own house he did not fail to be a winner, he showed that victory is possible anywhere anytime! I believe Steve accomplished his mission, he did what he came to do. In my opinion he gave his message.  "No matter who you are, where you are or what you do, you were born to win! So go ahead and spread your wings to fly higher, without fear of falling down! Because this is the destiny of all us"  Thank you Steve God be with you.&nbsp;
Rest in peace "Monsieur" Steve.  You have simply changed our Past, Present and Future.  Thank You! <br>
My deepest condolences to the family, friends and co-workers of Steve Jobs. The impact this one man has had on our world is remarkable. I cannot imagine life without my iPod,  my iPhone, my iPad or my MacBook, and to think we didn't have any of them a decade ago.  Thank you Steve for your ingenuity, your inventiveness, your vision; rest in peace.&nbsp;
My sincere condolences to Steve's family and his colleagues at Apple. His loss is the world's loss. He inspired us to create products that are insanely great and his legacy will live forever. Thank you, Mr Jobs, you will be missed.
Steve thank you for being a visionary with your ideas and for defining technology as we know it today!  As you said one day: "You've got to find what you love..." And this is what i'm doing!
Thanx for creating the tools we are now taking profit of... thanx man!&nbsp;
To Steve, wherever you are, never stop creating!  Thanks from Me and my 86 year old Mom. We love Apple! 
This is a such a sad day. I had no idea how deeply I'd be affected by this news. Steve's inspiration and legacy will forever be a part of the story of my life. Much love to those who really knew him.&nbsp;
Have a nice trip Steve...&nbsp;
I am deeply sad and my condolences to his family.  The world was changed for ever by Steve and we will never have a greater innovator! God Bless his family and may he rest in eternal peace!&nbsp;
I believe we have suffered a great loss! My heart is with you! May your spirit go higher and may you rest in peace! My sincere condolences! 
 As sad as it is to no longer have Steve with us (in physical form), it is somewhat "fitting" that he left the world now at the height of his success, at the top in so many ways - completing a phenomenal life and business story only the Creator could dream up.  He was a man that perfectly epitomized the virtues: quality over quantity - through design, through human-machine interaction, through corporate messaging.  In every way, Steve Jobs exuded the ever profound truth that less is more.  His time here on earth was no different. I cannot help but to wonder what the world could have been with another 56 years of Steve Jobs.  Regardless, I am certain that his life, the example he set, will inspire us (and future generations) to follow in his foot-steps. In that way, Steve Jobs lives forever.
I was so saddened when my browser opened to the Apple home page a short while ago to see Steve's image.  My condolences go out to Steve's family and all of the employees of Apple.  As an Apple customer, I so admire the detail and the thought that has gone in to each of the Apple products I use, and I know Steve's drive for perfection and excellence is a big reason those products are what they are.  As a business person, I admire the hugely successful organization Steve co-founded and led for many years.  As a parent, a wife a daughter and a friend, my heart goes out to all of those who Steve knew personally and who tonight mourn the loss of their loved one and friend.  Rest in Peace, Steve.  And may Apple continue to thrive on the foundation you have built.
Even though I never knew Steve Jobs personally he will be missed not only by me but the entire world. The world was a much better place with him in it! I pray for his Wife, Children and Family! Rest In Peace Steve! You will always be remembered and honored! 
He was an amazing, creative, innovative, brilliant person who forever changed our world  He will be sadly missed.
My sympathies to your family and friends.    Rest in peace knowing you have made the world a better place.
I never thought myself to be an Apple fan until the iPod.  Your creative genius behind the iPod which led to the creation of the iPhone platform made me a convert.  More importantly, you made my Korean mother a convert. I lost my Dad to pancreatic cancer a little more than a year ago. The pain of which is still quite fresh - because, like you Steve, had a profound impact on my life and those who knew him.  My mother has me in the United States, but powered by her iPhone and iPad 2, she is able to bridge the gap of the Pacific to communicate - face-to-face - with her family there, cutting thousands of miles of distance between them.  It's helped my mother cope with the loss. Products serve a small purpose in our lives as they come and go.  But, Steve, your ideas changed the landscape, brought families close together, and made us believe in a company that sought more to inspire and lead in its industry, rather than sit on its laurels. I only wish I had sent this to steve@apple.com.  But, somehow, I know that the millions of email messages and phone calls that you received - you already know that there are those like me who feel lucky to have been able to experience your imagination and vision.&nbsp;
As a student of the business world, I have always been inspired by your creativity, your leadership, your focus on simplifying design, and your endless pursuit of real innovation.    Thank you for teaching the world a lot about driving business growth through innovation and passion. Thank you for being Apple, and making Apple live in many of us.    I met an Apple advertising executive at a Harvard Marketing course around 2002 and bought my first iPod and G4 shortly thereafter. I'm still using the G4 and now own an iPad, numerous iPods, an iMac, Macbook pro and Macbook. You've made my family's lives easier and better. As an investor in Apple, you've helped me send my kids to university.    Thank you - I'm a Mac.
 only the  future will show us, more and more, how great steve was... 
Steve is the example that one person can make the difference in this crazy world. Unfortunately, the good ones go too early...he made a difference in our lives connecting the world in one. A genius...the name of our time. The real best. A hero. Thank you Steve, rest in peace.
1984...seems like it was only yesterday that we were unwrapping our very own Apple IIc from under the Christmas tree.  I learned about computers on an Apple.  Apples were all over school campuses, loved by all. Today, I type this on my Macbook...that very same Apple IIc still sits in a box at my work...and yes, it still works perfectly. And much like school campuses 25 years ago, Apple is loved by students everywhere today, and companies all around the world would do anything to be 1/10th as influential on our generation as Apple has been. Thank you Steve.  For all you have done to make this relationship with Apple everything I would have hoped it would be.  Death for you my friend was merely physical, for your legacy will live on forever in each of us. May you Rest In Peace.
My condolences to Steve's family, Steve's corporate family and the rest  of us "Mac Heads" who have followed, adopted and benefited from the  Apple way of doing things.&nbsp;
Not many people come along like Steve, and when one does it's a great thing, but it is also a great loss when a person like that moves on to the next part of life, but we must remember, where ever they go next, they are making it there as Magical as they did here. 
I had the honor of meeting Steve when I started working for apple. It truly i s a great loss. His advice will stay with me for the rest of my life. His inspiration and achievements will live on forever.
Your love and passion for humanity will stay with us in every "touch". Thanks for making the world a better place, Forever
I am so sorry to hear this devastating news - we have all lost a genius and visionary who has helped enrich our lives through his technology. &nbsp;We will miss you Steve!
    People remember you.     
  My first computer job in ‘91 was repairing and configuring the Apple Macintosh for a firm in Columbia, MD.   I started my computer career working on the products he produced.   He will be missed.   R.I.P. Steve
Steve,  I never met you, or ever saw you in person, but you got me interested in technology in a way I never thought possible. The future will not be what it is  without your influence, you were a true visionary who will be deeply missed. Thank you.
Thank you Steve Jobs and Apple for creating revolutionary products that I love, and that I love using. Every day.  Keep the innovation alive.&nbsp;
I am truly saddened by the news that is reached that night, thanks to the iPhone from Apple including the visionary Steve Jobs that I have learned that creating the new that night and I'm really falling down all my condolences to  the family Steve, his friends and all are team is now in mourning.&nbsp;
I am a japan high school student.  I love steve and apple.  I am so sad.   But I have been followed apple ever.  
Dear Steve, You are in a better place, you have revolutionized the world  with your amazing imagination. Thank you for everything you have done.&nbsp;
To Steve Jobs' family, I am truly sorry for your loss.  As an owner of many Apple products, I have always respected and enjoyed listening to Mr. Jobs.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an incredibly inspirational person. He was dedicated to  his work, so much as to know when it was his time to step down for the  betterment of the company. He will be greatly missed and we would be so  incredibly fortunate as to see another man as brilliant and  sophisticated as Mr. Jobs was. Rest In Peace Mr. Jobs. You will be  missed by the billions of people to whom you serviced by in my mind  inventing what we know today as the 21st Century. You made all this  technology and the world what it is today. Thank you.  Sincerely,&nbsp;
Your life will continue to inspire my own.  Thank you 
I read it a few minutes ago and i am shocked! Steve was a unique genius on stage and his presentations were entertainment!  Apple will ever be Steve... Rest in peace Steve&nbsp;
May the good Lord have a special place for a super special  person called Steve Jobs.... Thank you so very much for sharing your vision with us all...I truly believe in your creation and must say the very best and not to mention, beautiful computers, iPhones and all the rest of your inventions...We will truly miss your ideas and your innovations that only you could have made this come true...So my dear brother, God Bless you and may our dear Lord have a special place for you...send us some of your ideas from up above...RIP...You truly will be missed from people all over the world...Amen...!!!!!!!!!!!
This man was a visionary. He will always be remembered in my mind as one  of the greatest innovators to be on this planet.
Hace apenas 5 años que entré al mundo Apple y sin lugar a dudas fue una gran decisión. Tu influencia Steve sobre todos y cada uno de tus productos y el cuidado exc esivo en cada uno de los detalles logro marcar una gran diferencia entre TU compania y el resto del mundo. Tu vida es un claro ejemplo de lucha y sacrificio. Las dificultades que tuvi ste al momento de salir de aquella empresa que fundaste para dar desarrollar  a una de las mejores empresas de animación en el mundo y finalmente re gresar a tu Apple; gracias a ti la compania regreso al rumbo del éxito y  hoy es la empresa con mayor market cap del mundo. Impresionante hablar de todos los problemas de salud que viviste, en los cua les nos demostraste que la enfermedad mas grave puede ser curada si se tiene  la fortaleza y tenacidad para luchar contra ella. Sin duda tus anios mas br illantes en el ámbito profesional se dieron mientras librabas la batall a mas dura de tu vida que era seguir vivo. Es momento de volver a decirte gracias Steve, revolucionaste mi mundo y el d e todos los que vivimos en el. Descansa en paz Steve, te lo mereces, mientras tanto nosotros seguiremos dis frutando todas esas maravillas que nos dejaste.
He who has brought a big change in the way we work and the world we live in. Brilliant man, thanks and RIP.
I'm sure you gonna be in heaven now.... rest in peace! 
So sorry for your loss. With a mind and dedication like what Steve displayed, he will be truly missed. Technology has forever been changed.   With the deepest sympathy.

To Steve's family his Wife Laurene and children my respects and condolences and thank youfor sharing Steve with ALL of us a unique genius special person. Thank you Steve for ALL You did.
I may have never met Steve, but just listening to him talking I could  tell the kind man he was. I'm really sad the world has lost a person  like Steve, a genius who changed the world and defined new limits to our  culture with his innovative ideas.
I can't believe it, he was one of the persons who change the world with  all the new technology he provided. RIP Steve Jobs!!  You always will be in my heart!!&nbsp;
You were the one that made communication so wonderful for me that I sold many many records...You Steve are so fine...Rest well brother...&nbsp;
How unfortunate for our world to lose such creativity and   inventiveness. I did not know Steve personally but (curiously) feel   his loss personally and extend deepest sympathy to his family and   friends. 
I am shocked and deeply saddened that Steve Jobs has passed away. The man was a visionary, a genius among men, towering over others with a passionate mix of creativity, technical brilliance and leadership. He served as an inspiration to me. I always hoped that once I complete my MBA, that I would get a chance to meet the legend. His loss will be deeply mourned and shockwaves will be felt the world over.  Rest in Peace Steve Jobs! You were a goliath among men. God Bless!
My Apple products now feel like symbols of an iconic story, mind and  visionary. And they are. &nbsp;Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs 
Thank you, Steve Jobs!   You was a genius, changed the world and helped many people!  God bless you and your family to get over this difficult time!&nbsp;
Hi Steve,  Sleep well for tomorrow lives on. A glance to Apple and kind wishes for the road ahead.&nbsp;
I've never met you. I've never worked for you in any sort of way. Still you have given me and many others inspiration. What you stood for and did, I can only challenge myself to do. You have achieved so much in a short life.  You have changed our industry and many others which people could not even dream of.  You are one of those rare people in history that will be remembered long after they are gone.  I salute you.  May your soul Rest In Peace.  God Bless  -
God took back the Gift named "Steve Jobs" that he gave to the world! He the pioneer in changing the way people looked &amp; used Phone &amp; Computers. My sincere condolences to his family and his employees.&nbsp;
Steve,  you changed our lives... made it easier, better, enjoyable, you gave the computer world its Renaissance...  You will be remembered forever... You are truly an inspiration..  God Bless you and Thank you for everything...&nbsp;
A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve, you changed a big part of my life... I'll never forget you...  Rest in Peace  Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. 
I grew up with command language and now bask in GUI.  Thanks Steve. I am so sad. <br>
To most of us, Steve was this cool guy who seemed to be a DaVinci genius taking us through doors glimpsing the future, while capturing the imagination of throngs of people.&nbsp;But more importantly he was a special person to those who loved him best.&nbsp;I'd like to extend my sincere condolences to his children, his wife, his entire family, and all those who knew him best.&nbsp;I lost my father two years ago and it's still hurts.&nbsp;This must be so hard for Steve's kids&nbsp;but they can be immensely proud of their father and have a warm, peaceful, feeling he did not leave this world with deep regrets or a sense of what could have been. &nbsp;His was a wonderful life.
My sincerest condolences on the lost of a visionary. Even though I personally have never met Mr Jobs, he has changed my perception of what a personal computer should be. His insight and dedication to us, the customer, has been felt so personal. His dreams of making things user friendly was unique and so appriciated. I hope that he has passed this on to his fellow Apple family, because its a touch that is surely missed.  Forever in our prayers.&nbsp;
I am very sad on the death of Steve Jobs, who changed the way we live.  I am using one of his innovation MacBook Pro to compose this message and  pass my deep sorrow to Apple.&nbsp;
Thank you for bringing such great things into the lives of so many, you  will be missed. To your family my dearest sorrow.Your ideas will live on  forever. 
 ima colombian, i have never have an apple product, im still cant aford one, today i bougth my first ipod, i will save this ipod for the rest of my life, is special and for me the last real iPod made from steve's dreams. carry on guys! keep alive the dream!            
To say that he changed the world is an immeasurable understatement... To say he will be missed a gross trivialization... To call him an oracle comes closer... Like the ripples from a pebble dropped into water... His significance will continue in perpetuity...  
RIP Steve Jobs. You were directly responsible for bringing every creative thought and ability I have had to life. You were the bridge between geek and artist. <br>
Like Edison, another innovative inventor, you illuminated our world. Thanks for everything Steve!&nbsp;
He changed the world, his ideas motivated masses, his legacy is in everyone' s hands, he managed to make a dent in the universe. Unfortunately I never got to meet him, but its just as if I did. Steve Jobs, I'll see you soon.
Thank you for the opportunity to have on my desk, in my pocket and in my  ears the best companions I've ever had.  Receive my condolences.&nbsp;
As a user of Apple products at softbank,I’ll use them, and love them. I respect  his great spirits.
The DaVinci of our times, he gave us the rope for us to climb the mountain of technology, his steps will be remember forever and his path must be follow to be succesful, just like him, a great man who’s ideology was expressed in his slogan “Think different”, we will never forget you.
Rest in peace, Steve Jobs, I will never forget you. Thank you for a better world.
 Steve,  You'll be missed!   Thanks for all you did! &nbsp;
It's a sad, ironic yet beautiful thing to learn of your passing from my iPad  2.  You changed the fabric of society with your vision and creativity. Than ks for improving my quality of life.  Peace unto you.
I am truly grateful for the inspiration, advice, and creations he has given me. I am a graphic designer and because of him I can do my job.  RIP Steve you will be missed.&nbsp;
 My condolences for the loss of Steve Jobs. He have changed the world through his innovative products and a great energy he showed whenever he's talking in front of the audience. The technology world will not be where it is now if not for Steve.  May He rest in peace.  Jeffrey.             
You were a genius, always a visionary, you will cherish forever steve.
Today the world lost one great visionary.  I hope Apple will have the wit and the vision to carry Steve's.  Let's hope they won't fail to carry his vision.  Steve, the world will miss you.
There are no words to express the void the passing of Steve Jobs has created. The world has lost a true leader !  Rest in Peace!
R.I.P MR STEVE JOBS you changed my life but also the millions of people forever ! We never forget you. My thoughts are for his family, his friends and of course for the staff of Apple. That his spirit guides for ever Apple <br>
Very few men achieve Steve Jobs status of greatness. A great human being  that made our life easier and enjoyable through modern technology. No  word can describe the sadness of knowing that Steve Jobs has pass away.  He will be missed.  
It is a sad day today. The world has lost a very powerful person. He had great ideas, was a person that had revolutionary ideas. He revolutionized the world.      The amount of things Steve Jobs has done is incredible. It wont be the same without him.     Sorry to see you go Steve.     Rest In Peace.     My condolences to the Steve Jobs family  and the  Apple family. Sorry for your loss.
Steve Jobs, A Mentor, and an engineering genius that will never be forgotten. Steve Jobs is someone I'll never have the pleasure of meeting unfortunately. Death is a part of life that no piece of technology can prevent. Steve will always be remembered for who he was an idol, a husband, a friend, a co-worker, etc... the list goes on. He enlightened us with his technological skills and wisdom. His sincere passion for the products and consumers will always be remembered. Steve will forever live on in the products he stood behind and the accomplishments him and the company made along the way. &nbsp;
Very sad day!!! He has made alot of people's lives alot easier and more enjoyable with his products!!!&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an unbelievable visionary who made a company revolutionize the technology world.  You will be missed...&nbsp;
Steve was my age and I saw my first Apple II at a show in Kansas City in the late 70's, bought my first computer in 1983, an Apple IIe.  Fell in love with the Mac in 1985 and have spent untold amounts of money since then but don't regret a dime of it.  Steve changed my life for the better and I will always love and appreciate his talent and inspiration.  I will miss him.&nbsp;
steve thanks for the wonders you have given us hope to live well in heaven,) I hope that your workers will inspire more and more each year as you did thanks
Why did he have to go? I'm a bit of a apple fangirl, I use mac, I even   have an iPhone 4.I remember the day I got  my first iPhone, it was before school started, I came home from a   walk, we I went to talk with my mom, I heard a  phone ring that I didn't hear before, then I turned to see an iPhone.   And I still have it even to this day . I can't  believe he's gone, I  even said that I hope he gets better so we won't   lose a genius. I guess those words were too  late. My condolences to the Jobs family. We'll miss you  
Thanks for everything Steve. A true hero in my eyes. I wish you well in what  comes next.&nbsp;
I'm Jack and I'm 11 years old and ever since I got my iPod nano when I was 8 , I started a love for the company Apple. I then started researching the company and doing research a lot of your products. I then found out who Steve Jobs was. I began to watch keynotes from the very beginning. I now have and iPad 2 and planning to get the iPhone 4s very soon. Steve was my hero. I will  miss him soooooooooooooooooooooooo much.
You have brought so much hope, excitement and fun to us. Now it is time  for us to say to say "iThankYou" to you. Rip Jobs! 
Today is a sad day! I lost my idol! Rest in peace master! And thank you  for creating a more simple world! 
May you RIP Steve Jobs. May your legacy continue to serve as inspiration  to us all. Praying the world will eventually be blessed with someone  even half as brilliant and extraordinary as you.
 Thank you Sir Steve Jobs! As I a remember during my high school days here in  the Philippines you're  just a name for me that I need to memorized during our exams in computer history. I guess your already a hero of the history of computer even when you're still alive. You made every family so much close because of your inventions. You made every relationship "works" even if miles apart. You made every individual "smile" for every new applications to enjoy.  Your God given talent is very much appreciated all over the world.  I guess your purpose of existence is very well fulfilled.  Applaud to you SIR STEVE JOBS!   Thank you.&nbsp;
Thank's for everything.
i'm living in korea. i pity his demise. he's my idol. all people must not forget him. he's ageless. we will miss him.
Steve's family,  I am so sorry that you lost this genius man. He was so great and inspiring.  We will all miss him. When I met and talked to him- he was so inspiring!  He will still be in my heart and my Apples too.&nbsp;
Sad day today.&nbsp;
Condolences to the lucky people who actually knew and loved Steve Jobs. Those of us who only knew the public Steve are saddened, too. He was remarkable and will never be forgotten. He changed our world in so many ways, always making it more amazing.  
My father celebrated a birthday a couple of weeks ago and received a gift that he never expected. Not really the type to be into electronics or gadgets, about 1 year ago I introduced him to the iPhone 4. Just like the millions of others who get hooked once they hit the touch screen, my father was an Apple fanatic. But just 2 weeks ago, celebrating his 56th birthday, he was opening his last gift on a Tuesday night with my Mother and 2 sisters. My sisters and I had disguised our gift in a shoe box as to throw him off so he thought it would be another typical gift...Dress shoes!!! However, when he cracked the shoe box and we saw the expression and disbelief on his face, my sister's and I knew we hit one out of the park. In complete shock, he said "Oh my god...this is the best birthday ever!!!!" iPad 2 made it the best birthday for him and a birthday/memory that our family will forever remember. My sister's and I have Steve to thank for this happy and memorable moment.
The world is full of dreamers, there is nothing particularly special in that. But Steve was a dreamer and a doer. That is unfortunately far more rare and special.  When Steve dreamed he dreamed in Technicolor™ when everyone else dreamed in black-and-white. He had to package these brilliant dreams of his in black or white cases so that the rest of us would be able to dream about them too.   In truth, we only saw a small spectrum of Steve Jobs' brilliance. The world is much the poorer for his loss.  May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
i'm a representer of site legendom.com we play minecraft, but i'm not here to advertise our site... our site would love to say couple words in memory of a great man steve jobs We would love to say thank you Steve Jobs for all you have done for us, for future, and for computer world!! we always loved apple products. We appreciate all that steve has done for computer world and future of this planet. We are very thankful and grateful to him. Steve was and will always be in our hearts and there is nothing bad anyone could say about him Thank you, and good bye Steve, Rest in peace. 
REST IN PEACE, LEGEND.&nbsp;
We are praying for your comfort during this trying time, the world will miss steve's creativity, innovation and heart.  An avid apple fan, an avid steve jobs fan.
 It is a special class of men that are able to create great personal success out of humble beginnings. But men like Steve Jobs are even more special. Men like him are so rare, in fact, that there is no class for them. There have been so few - so few men whose excellence, genius, courage, and will alone are strong enough that the man improves the world by simply fulfilling his potential. When men like this pass, the loss is tremendous. God bless Steve Jobs for being true to himself and for legacy of greatness he has left us. I will miss him.&nbsp;
   The whole world has lost a genius... 
The world lost an artist, because his creations were beautiful and perfect. If I could sum up the Apple and Steve Jobs, would equal to the binary, because from them that everything exists.&nbsp;
May God rest his soul in eternal peace. 
Since a young age, Steve Jobs has been my biggest role model. He has given me hope that someday I could become as inspirational and world-changing as him. I had always dreamed of meeting him; however, I see now that he is all around me in all of the wonderful innovations he helped create. He forever will be here with us.&nbsp;
Steve, thank you for giving us so much magic, now in Heaven they will enjoy your great creativity! Rest in peace great genious!&nbsp;
I am only fourteen, and I am so sad that this could have ever happened.  Steve was one of the people who inspired me and will continue to inspire  me with his ideas focusing on being different and how he changed the  world. He proved that there is an aspiring genius in all of us and that  we should strive for excellence and we do not know who the next Einstein  will be. Personally I felt he was the Einstein of our generation. He  shaped everyone in numerous ways. I will miss hearing about him and his  ideas and I hope Apple Inc. will continue to strive. R.I.P&nbsp;
Apple is an amazing product that has change my life for the best, that  is because the man behind it was so amazing. God Bless You and his family.&nbsp;
What you have created from iPod to iPhone has influenced my daily life immensely. Even your speech in Stanford graduation enlightened my devastating life which I had lived. Thanks to your philosophy and the product you created, I can be better one now. You gave a great impact to me. A good one. I really appreciate to you. I'll miss you so much. R.I.P 
 The world today has lost a great visionary, a great person, a genius. Steve Jobs was the Leonardo da Vinci of the modern world. He revolutionized the modern world with their inventions. And made our life much simpler Will dearly miss him. The world is in mourning. Sorry for the big loss. My sincere condolences to family, friends, colleagues and competitors. Today it's one thing to say, thank you rest in peace, Steve Jobs.            
It hurts when we think of not having him where he used to be, some how he felt it's coming and I am sure he was prepared for it. To leave our world after leaving his forever marked foot prints all over the place. Each one of us have something that Steve was part of. Not only that but also that his soul will remain in each and every house that have apple product.      He was the Genius that everyone looking for, he was the legend of apple that will never vanish.  At least he is not in pain anymore. But forever he will be known as the legend of apple.      God Bless His Soul&nbsp;
They don't get any better.&nbsp;
We're sorry for your great loss, Steve will live in your minds forever. &nbsp;Try to remember all the good times you shared together.
 Steve Jobs revolutionized the way we all see technology. Without his great mind I'm unsure that the world would be the same it is today. Even though I do not know Steve personally and I am sure that most showing their sorrow of the loss of Steve today only knew him as Apples CEO, I am positive that he greatly impacted my life and truly opened my eyes to the world. Today we all lost a great human being that forever will be in our hearts.  RIP Steve    ~ just another apple user and supporter&nbsp;
 Deepest Condolences for the departing of a Great Visionary Man, Mr. Steve Jobs.Although I am sure Steve and his surrounding people do not know me, but like millions people in this world, I am so impacted with your life.Mr. Steve Jobs is like a shinning star which always be remembered, as long as Apple. May God give comfort &amp; strength to all the family members, friends and colleagues.God bless you Mr. Steve Jobs, God bless Apple.&nbsp;
If you have ever been asked, "If you could sit down with one person for dinner, who would it be, dead or alive?"  I would have to say Steve Jobs, hands down.  I obviously never knew the man but after watching a handful of keynote videos with him, and making Apple my tech-choice, he seems like a very interesting man who would share some interesting words of wisdom.  He will be missed by billions of people whether they are aware of it or not, now and in the future.  Thank you Steve Jobs. 
Such a sad day. We all lost a genius and a wonderful person too early. It's not fair.....  All my condolences to the Apple family. 
My Deep regrets &amp; condolence to Steve's family. &nbsp;Jobs showed the world his amazing creativity and his spirit to all the innovators.  His place would never been replaceable in the history.&nbsp;
Sincéres condoléances à la famille de Steeve ainsi qu'à Apple .
My Apple computer has the sad job of helping me to construct a very sad  condolence note to the family and employess of Steve Job this evening. The technology world has lost its premier visionary of all time, the  metropolitan Bay area has lost a wonderful resident and the country has  lost a good man. My grand-daughter is celebrating her 16th birthday today and she is  shedding tears of sorrow for this iconic man of all times.
Great man. Great work. Great example for the whole world.  
Hello.  I remember it like it was yesterday.  My first Macintosh.  1984.  I   was a graphic designer, and my world was about to change.  I embraced   it, and never looked back.  THANK YOU Steve, with all my heart; for permeating all areas of my   personal and professional life.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was and will always be my inspiration. He is the one who got  me to believe that starting a company is possible.
Mr. Steve Jobs showed an entire generation how to overcome adversity and remain committed to a vision. Anyone that has followed his career will recall the moments of triumph, but also the setbacks. These setbacks now fade into history and the lesson we can all teach our children is to persevere.&nbsp;
He'll never be forgotten. He revolutionised the computer business. He will be missed, he was loved. 
A creative genius, the Leonardo Da Vinci of our time. The only man that could truly connect the dots for the future. Thank you Mr. Steve Jobs. May you rest in peace and we will all remember you.&nbsp;
My heartfelt condolences go out to the Apple   and Mr. Jobs family. The world has lost a Great Man! Thank you for keeping the world connected with your brilliant accomplishments. RIP Mr. Jobs!&nbsp;
I like to send my love and prayers to his family. So very sad for their loss, it is our loss. We lost one of the most amazing and brilliant man today.
Thank you, Steve, for your contribution to us all. You have enriched my life  and many others' through your work. You will not be forgotten.&nbsp;
I'm using Mac over 15 years and I am honored to have  known Apple's product. Thanks Steve Jobs 
I just wanted to say thank you Steve and your Apple crew. You are really amazing, and we greatly appreciate what you've done for this world. You've made this world become so much better. I am a true Apple fan and I was heartbroken to hear that you've passed away. Rest in peace, Steve. You are above the iCloud now.
You have been a gift. Thanks.
You have been able to turn every business you have ever touched into gold.  You are such an inspiration and I am deeply saddened by your loss.  I never got the chance to meet you, but you have impacted my life in so many ways.  You will be missed Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
I miss you dearly already.  Though we have never met in person, you have been a part of me for more than half my life.  I feel that we have shared many precious moments together.  Since the time I learned what Cut &amp; Paster was on ClarisWorks, to the iPhone, and now to the iPad, I feel that we did this journey together.  I loved everything about you, your passion, your vision, your Genius….I decided to join your team to share more closely the bond that we had started.  I had the opportunity to become part of your family that welcomed me with open arms.  I learned more about the humble nest you helped build throughout the years.  I learned to experience and help share the joy with many.  I promise to share your love with all who come to visit us.  I don't have the words to express my love for you, but please know that I will miss you so much, and hope you continue to watch upon us and guide us with your love and care.&nbsp;
The world is a better place because of Steve Jobs, his mark will be   left on the world forever.  God bless his family and close friends   during this difficult time.  The world has lost a genius. &nbsp;
My condolences to Apple and steve's family for the loss of a great man . 
Please accept our depest and sincere wishes for Steve's family and  friends. He is sure in a better place. He shall live within us with his work and legacy.
Today is the most unhappy day in my life. Steve was a Mentor for me, and I know he was a Mentor for billion people around the world. The world lost a genius! I pray for God to put Steve in His arms! Thanks Steve for your existence and your inspirations! God bless you! My condolences for Steve Jobs's family!
I think the world has lost a creative genius and an icon. His ideas and vision has touched the world and he will be missed. My deepest sympathy goes out to his family.
thanks for making my life so different and better with your ideas. Thanks to your family for creating you, my deep respects to them.
What a great legacy Steve Jobs has left behind. He allowed us all to have the world at our fingertips, but with the style and whimsy of a dream. He will always be a true inspiration. I'm so thankful for the work he accomplished and I know he will be missed for a long, long time to come.  I would love to see Apple give a portion of 4s sales to cancer research in his name.  Keep up the good work for him!&nbsp;
Brasil loves you!! RIP good man&nbsp;
Years before I was an Apple employee, an Apple fan, an Apple nerd, I was  a 12-year-old girl counting the days until her iPod Mini came in the  mail. It was the first piece of technology that was truly mine, that I  didn't have to share, and it even had my name on its lime-green back.  Fast-forward 8 years, and I'm helping the public choose their own iPods,  their own pieces of technology that we all now marvel over. Jump forward  another 2 years, and I'm teaching people how technology from iPhones to  iPads to MacBooks can change their lives. Creating moments of  connecting, of sharing, of learning. Bringing people together as  coworkers, customers, and fans. I feel like this was Steve's goal for  Apple Retail, and I'm so lucky I could be a part of achieving it. Steve  was the driving force, the magician behind the magic. Steve's creativity and fearlessness as a leader will never fade. I will  always be inspired by his tenacity and fervor for his life's work. We as  employees share Steve's passion, and I can only hope that this passion  will continue his legacy. Rest in peace, and thank you.&nbsp;
Goodbye, Mr. Jobs. I have been with you since 1987 and will like many  others, will try to keep your ideals at the forefront of what Apple  brings to the consumer, including me. Tonight I think of my Apple products around the house and am glad I have  them. Of them, my "Think Different" poster set comes to mind when I  think of all you stood for almost more so than the hardware; I then  realize, they couldn't find a better figure for that very series than you. Apple, let's resurrect the theme with one final subject: Steve. Farewell. 
My condolences go out to Steve's family, friends, and co-workers.  He  changed the world with his creativity, and he will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
I'm not an Apple user, but I am always impressed with the innovation and creativity of Mr. Steve Jobs. It's hard to find figures like him. My deep condolences to Mr.Steve Jobs, family, and Apple.&nbsp;
Thanks Steve for all your legacy. We will miss and never forget you. God  be with you. 
Thank you, Steve Jobs, for all you have done to connect us to each other and to the world.   You made computers easy to use. You listened to us and incorporated our wishes, thoughts, and desires into your products.   You have made my life ever so much easier.  For this I am ever so grateful. Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs. Bon Voyage as you start your next adventure&nbsp;
 I am just one man lost in a World who knows Steve Jobs by Apple. Thanks to him, I dream with an techonology im my life as an Ipad. That is my way to show how I care about him. Descanse em paz, Steve.&nbsp;
However long it lives we can only thank Steve for leading the way!
There are no words to describe my pain.  There are no words to describe my feelings. There are no words to describe his genius. There are no words to describe his grandiosity. There are no words for such a loss. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Steve's inspiration and creative presence forever change what we strive  for and how we learn. I remember getting my first mac! As a graphics  designer, I said to myself what the heck had I been waiting on. His  contribution has made our business possible and has given our children  reliable products that  will last and continue to inspire their creative  sparks!Thanks Steve.
Thank you Steve. Thank you for the passion you lived your life. Thank you for inspiring all of us to go after our dreams. You are a rockstar, a rebel, a sportsman of the year. An icon. Be sure, you transformed the lives of millions. You will live forever! There is nothing better to say than just thank you!
I thought you was going to take over the world? We wanted to be on your team, but it seems god is on your team to now too.  God bless.
Steve was and is my biggest hero i have, he inspired me to become a  enthusiast for computers and i love his products. He is the greatest man  I have ever seen and the greatest  business man there ever was. My only  goal in life is to become like him.He will be missed.
I am just remembering the first time I ever really realized who Steve Jobs was and how he impacted the world we live in.  I was sent a link to a Stanford Graduation address and thought, "wow-what amazing words".   Years later my company has since gone into Software development for the iPad and we hang on everything Steve Jobs has ever achieved.  He was an inspirational leader, a gutsy businessman, a risk taker and a believer.  I like that in a person and he had it in spades.   Rest in Peace Steve Jobs.  A very, very tough and cruel way to die, but you certainly knew how to live!  You will be remembered with tremendous admiration.     With sincere condolences to your family and colleagues&nbsp;
Steve, Please rest easy, knowing that you changed the world for the better. Rest well and deep. You deserve Peace and Serenity. With great respect and honor.
A big loss... not only for tech community.  Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve,   You have inspired a generation.  Thank you for all your work.  Rest in Peace.
Rest in Peace Mr Jobs, your spirit,straight and inspiration, stay with us around World, you change the earth.   My condolences&nbsp;
<span>Thank you for making computers and other technology available and intuitive to millions of people around the world. We have been an Apple family since the beginning!</span><br> <span>&nbsp;</span><br><br> 
Rest in peace my friend !!!!!!
I probably wouldn't be a designer today, if Steve Jobs didn't invite Apple. Steve was a great genius and making it possible to compute as we do today.  Steve always has been a great model to everyone who loves design and functionality.  May Steve Jobs rest in peace.&nbsp;
Gracias por brindar al mundo con tu revolucionaria tecnologia.  Descansa en paz.  Enviado desde mi iPhone 
An example to us all!  May he rest in peace!&nbsp;
I cannot imagine a world without Steve Jobs. Look how much he gave us. . . . am so sorry for this loss&nbsp;
We have lost an incredible person. I have known steve for over eleven  years and he will always be remembered by my kids.&nbsp;
The words of Apple about Steve Jobs is my opinion too. I'm a huge fan of Apple products so, I'm also a huge fan of Jobs's work. His life was strongly dedicated to the company? No, his life was strongly dedicated to make dreams come true. The company was his way for this. Incredible products. Steve is Apple's spirit. It's not a only a big company, it is a dream, a really big dream. So I'll remember forever how revolutionaries Apple and Steve are.
When Mr. Jobs came back to Apple, many years ago, I went right away and bought stock - I sold it three years ago and it paid for my entire wedding and honeymoon.  Thank you Mr. Jobs 
Thoughts and condolences to to the Jobs family. 
Whilst I never had the good fortune to meet him, a picture of Steve Jobs shares space on my office wall with pictures of others who have inspired me.  Steve is in the company of Mohandas Karamchand Ghandi, Albert Einstein, Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi, Martin Luther King, Viktor Frankl and others  who have, in my humble opinion, changed humankind for the better.  In short, Steve inspires and that is a mark of a truly great individual.  My sincerest condolences to his family and friends.
 We will all remeber Steve Jobs, an amazing man that has made using a computer very user friendly, and that has changed the world with the innovation technology from Apple, a man that has inspired all of us in one way or another.   Steve, We will all miss you in the technology world.            
I'm so so sorry to hear this terrible news.Steve was such a great visionary leader and an inspiration to all.  My  first computer was an Apple II and I've been using Apple ever since.   The dedication to quality is something that I always  admired about  Steve and Apple.  He will be missed.  My sincere condolances go out to Steve's family.&nbsp;
God Bless and Send Healing to the Jobs' Family. Steve Jobs Has Blessed our world with his wonderful mind. Thank you Steve Jobs.
Steve...you touched countless lives in such a short span with your genius, brilliance, vision and execution. You have created a void in the world that will never be filled. I mourn your passing away with a solemn heart and sadness..  RIP Steve. 
 He Was, He is and He will be forever the Leonardo Da Vinci of our time...the world will miss you Dear Steve...!   Just go with God.
Dear Steve.  Thank you for all the moments you gave us with your vision and passion. You will always be in every iPod, iPad, MacBook and in all of our techno  dreams. Hope you're now talking with god about the things that are coming for  all humanity.  Rest In Peace the most revolutionary man in the techno history. Steve Jobs, you will always be the man.
Rest in peace, Steve. We will remember you. 
My deepest condolences go out to the Jobs family. I have been an Apple Fan and a Steve Jobs fan for years. The products, mystic, marketing and methodology has been something that I have looked up to since I was introduced to my first Apple product. Steve was the prime example of a pure creative and innovative man. He will be missed, but is now in a better place.  My prayers are with you.  "stay hungry, stay foolish."&nbsp;
Dear Apple,  I am very sorry for your loss. Steve was not only a CEO but an  innovator. He changed the world so many time and make people's lives  improved. He has done his job well for the world. He may now rest in  peace.
This is a very sad moment, and Steve will be greatly missed. His creative and intelligent mind changed the world forever. Apple is what it is because of him. There is only a few words to sum up what Steve was, and the strongest to me is brilliant.  R.I.P - You will be greatly missed.  I hope Apple will continue to have such innovative and successful ideas with the loss of Steve.&nbsp;
I am forever a graphic artist and I will forever be a Mac guy. Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
Like John Wayne or Elvis, Steve was bigger then life.   I am so so sorry for your loss. I hope that his vision lives on at Apple.&nbsp;
Steve was one of the visionaries that I respected most.  RIP Steve.&nbsp;
I remember when I was little, hearing about the great Steve Jobs. Now, I  am still young at 14 years old, I hear about his passing. I am a large  buyer of Apple products, each one of them amazing me. Steve will go down  in history as a great innovator, one of the most advanced inventors, and  the man that created modern technology. Although it may sound stupid, I  am going to buy the iPhone 4s in respect of Steve Jobs. I pray for you  Steve, and those who are hurt from your death. You were creative.  Original. Inspiring. You are legendary. 
You were a living legend, Steve. You were not only an icon in technology, but you transcended into a worldwide cultural icon. Your ingenuity and attention to detail created the most usable user experience not only in computing, but mobile technology as well.  Along with iPod and iTunes you helped save the music industry and changed the way we consume media. With iPhone you changed the world of smarthphones by creating a much more intuitive user experience, and through the App store you revolutionized on the go productivity and entertainment.You were a living legend, Steve. Legends never die.
A true champion and inspirational guy at rest&nbsp;
Steve Jobs you are an artistic visionary. A creative intellect. A business genius &amp; you have helped push the world towards the future. Now allow for our prayers to push you into the deepest most peaceful parts of heaven. RIP 
Steve was my inspiration in life. I am so upset to hear about him passing as it is a real tragedy, and I feel like part of me has gone. Now wiping a tear from my eye I shall go. R.I.P. Steve Jobs 
Hi, Mr Jobs.  It is in contact with your obituary with surprise and sadness.   The first computer for me to purchase was LC630.  Even now, I remember the surprise and joy at that time vividly.   It is certain that the "future" which you made is in our hand.  The greatest gratitude and condolences are expressed.&nbsp;
I can't believe you are gone Mr. Jobs. My Heart hurts for you and your family. I hope now you are in a happier place and no longer have to deal with any pain. You have changed the world. There aren't many people capable of doing that. You have made Apple into a series of products that we touch daily, in different ways. I touch numerous Apple products a day and I love them all. I am hugely devoted to the Apple brand, what they stand for, the engineering, and the overall functionality of the device.   I cannot thank you enough for all you have done. You are already missed by millions of people. I hope you found time to look back and realized what you have accomplished. You are a true visionary and role model. I hope you have peace. My condolences to your family and friends.   You are gone way too soon, but never forgotten.&nbsp;
I am sadden to hear that he has passed. I can only think that he is in a  better place. I will always remember him, I studied a lot of the great  businesses and companies that he helped create and my heart and prayers go  out to his family, and the Apple family.   Respectfully a life long Apple fan.
&nbsp;A visionary, a dreamer but most of all a daring man.  May he be remembered for what he did for us all. &nbsp;
Steve made the world a better place. He willl be missed! Rest in Peace Steve  Jobs! I cried reading your history and watching your videos! Stupid cancer!  Just took the most inspiring person in the world. rest in peace!!
The nation has few heros, and it now has one less. 
I cannot believe I feel a loss this deep for someone I have never personally met. What a legacy. What a human being.&nbsp;
To apple,  Im only 16 and didn't even know Steve Jobs as a person, but as a  creator. He has been one of my heroes for a long time because he showed  me to "think different". Im a truly sadden by the worlds loss today. Its  written on my bucket list to meet him, but sadly I will never be able to  cross it off. He gave me so much and I love all my apple products (also  currently using my mail app). So I will try to stop crying and leave  Steve in my heart forever. 
Thank him for everything! The greatest man in a history, the greatest man in  minds of humanity! 
Steve was an innovative and driven person who converted his visions into reality.    A Picasso, a Rembrandt,  a Beatle.  We have truly lost a great person and sadly at such an early age.  He has left an indelible mark in our world.&nbsp;
Such a great loss. A man with an endless vision for the future that led a company to shine above the rest. My first purchase from Apple was an iPod shuffle and my recent was a Mac Pro for my graduate student son. We were both blown away by the technology of the Mac. Mr. Jobs was a brilliant man. God bless his family and bring them strength through this difficult time.
To the family, friends, and colleagues who had the pleasure to know Steve I send my heartfelt condolences. The brilliant life he led as a person was a spark that this world can never forget. He was a man who changed the world and  gave us the ability to communicate with those we love. My wife and I use FaceTime to see eachother and I can not be thankful enough for the contribution he made to our lives as a whole. The world has lost a beautiful person whose mission in life was more than achieved. He will forever be in my prayers a nd my thoughts. Thank you Mr. Jobs. May you go now to your Creator and be in  eternal peace. :
Steve, we will miss you! You were the Revolution and you are the PERFECT example of the American Dream is all about. The American Dream for me is, if you work hard and and believe in yourself, then you can do anything. Thank you for everything you have not only given me, but the world. Rest in Peace.<div><br></div><div>Ps. Am I the only one that feels that you should have a star on Hollywood Blvd or you should receive a award?</div>
What can we all say?   You gave us your dreams and turned them into our  reality.  We can't thank you enough for the innovation you shared and ease  of life that you created for humans today.  Why is it that the earth  loses those who are vital to our well being and growth? You will be  missed forever.  Keep them on their toes in the heavens, dear Steve.
   One of my most vivid memories as a child is when my dad took me to the Apple store in Hayward, Ca. and bought his first Apple; a 2c. My mom was so angry, she wouldn't speak to him when we came home! She learned to embrace computers though. I learned how to program on an Apple 2 E that my dad brought home from work,as well. I now work on a Mac in my current place of business. My sister also works for Apple in Cupertino, Ca. Steve has affected my family in so many fond ways. Thank you Steve, for all the memories. :)&nbsp;
乔布斯先生,   您好!   我是一个中国学者,听闻你不幸的消息,我表示难过!但是,你并没有离开我们,你的灵魂,你的思想传播了全世界,因为我们没有iphone,就真的没有iphone!   中国人一句话:同志,您走好!
So sad. Such a genius!  Best wishes for Apple. 
Nothing can really explain how i feel at this moment, since the first  time i saw steve in WWDC he has been my idol and have always thought of  him as much more than just a boss of a company, he was a visionary and a  genius who has changed the world of computing as we know it, the world  has lost a great human being and i can only say that he will be missed  by the Apple community immensely and the rest of the tech world.<div><br></div><div>R.I.P. Steve you will be missed</div>
Dear Jobs,  Thank you for everything that you gave us. Every famous gadget that   you created, but without you, Apple won't disappear. Thank you for the   big company that you has inherited and shared to everybody. You were a   big example to the humankind.
You are the hero in my heart and your spirit inspire me to move forward! Thank you! Best wishes to your family!
Dear All,    My Heart Felt Condolences for his family and the apple company people. We lost a great leader and innovator, it’s a sad day for all of us.
I recently have not often been a fan of apple's policy about patents, but nevertheless Apple, especially trough Steve Jobs, has been an example to our company and for me in particular, for its efforts, its ambition, courage and its way of never giving up!  R.I.P. Steve.&nbsp;
My condolences to Steve's family and everyone that worked with him. I am overwhelmed with regret for never reaching out to Steve when I had the chance.  While I was going through college and my first job interview when people asked me what is my goal in life, I always said "to work with Steve Jobs and be a part of his greatness". Steve was my hero and my guide.  I never got the great privilege to meet Steve, but I know what he has taught the world will never die. Rest in peace Steve you will always be the greatest!!!  You will be greatly missed but never forgotten.
 I have never owned any computer, music player or tablet other than my apples..  I have been a loyal apple owner since the G3.  I am also an avid fan of Disney and Pixar, another company touched by Steve.  We will miss his innovative and creative imaginings....  Thoughts and prayers go out to his family and his apple family. So sad to have lost him so young.
 Hi, I obviously do not personally know Steve Jobs but he has been an inspiration for me and the rest of the world. I would like to offer my condolences to his family, friends and colleges. I think its fair to say that we have lost one of the greatest men of modern times if not the greatest.            
Steve has changed the world, changed not only how we interact with each  other but move the bar on what we should expect from technolgy  innovation. He has been an inspiration for my career, my goals and now with his  personal battle with health, an inspiration on how to look at one's life  and how to live it.  My hope is that those close to him, specially his family, find comfort  in knowing how many lives he has positively influenced.  Steve, you will be missed.&nbsp;
 Steve gave me the tools that changed my life forever.  He had the soul of an artist with a passion for perfection, and his  vision touched me.  I'm forever grateful to him and terribly saddened by Steve's passing, <br>
Great loss to our nation, He was absolutely visionary and achieve  complex process into very simple. Because of him we and our parents  learned to use computers.&nbsp;
Where would we be today musically, creatively and technologically  without the genius of Steve Jobs who has brought us along a great and  speedy journey into his beautiful world of computer? He will be missed  greatly and undoubtably cannot be replaced. I wish his family my deepest  condolences. &nbsp;
We  remember the first Apple computers back when we were first in college. We were so anxious to use it as we loved the concept and thought it was amazing! There were many doubters, but we didn't listen. We knew he had something special, that he was something special.  We knew that the computer was going to be used by everyone in all aspects of life. We knew we would see much more from him.  Many innovations that he created my husband  and  I use in our day to day jobs and lives. We are so sad that his life was cut short. But his legacy will live on long after many of us are gone and forgotten. So live on Steve, live on.  Now it is up to the future children of this country to be the next Steve Jobs.  Let's take better care of funding for our kids in public schools, and in our colleges. They are producing the next Steve.&nbsp;
No words. All feelings
My condolences to the Jobs Family and Friends.  His creativity and  excitement about technology encouraged me to become a nerd.  Gone too soon, Steve will be missed. 
To Steve's family,  Your husband and father's work was the inspiration for my career, and  the success that I've since been so blessed to have and share with my  family. Thank you for sharing him with us, and may his spirit and soul be  blessed wherever he travels next on his journey.  With sympathies and kind regards
You mark our ears, our hands, our desks.  R.I.P Steve Jobs (1955-2011) 
A  great loss to the world!!! He is a true icon, a gift to the world. A true believer, a fighter for the human spirit. Having been adopted at birth did not affect him. He was a godsend, an inspiration to millions around the globe. May you rest in peace, Steve. Your physical body has left but your spirit lives on. I hope Apple continues the tradition you started-innovation and delivering  the best. Thank you Steve Jobs for your courage, fortitude, and your spirit!
I want Apple to know how full of emotion I feel at the passing of the brilliant Mr Jobs, and in awe of his genius.  I have been an Apple user since 1990. The company has been a part of my life for over 20 years and I feel Mr Jobs completely revolutionized our world. What an amazing legacy to leave behind to our world in so many ways. Thank you Steve, for your vision, your untiring dedication and visionary mind that has so expanded our lives. May you reap all the joy and love you have so freely given to us all. Blessings to you.&nbsp;
I remember when I received my first iPod. I was so happy. This is what  brought me to Apple. The visionary man who created what I so cherished  has passed. Now, as I type on my MacBook Pro, I will forever remember  this genius that we call Steve Jobs. Every text on my iPhone, every song  on my iPod, every app that I open will serve as a reminder of their  original creator- Steve Jobs. I will miss you so much Steve.   
The Henry Ford of our time. 
I just want to say that people take things in life for granted. At my campus, I see thousands of students everyday walk around listening to their iPods or iPhones, or use their MacBooks and iPads in class. It is unbelievable the size of the footprint that Steve has left on my generation. Forever will I remember what he did to enhance my life. Steve Jobs is a person who has revolutionized the world. Today is truly a sad day.&nbsp;
I hope we can move forward and put positive use to the instruments you   have given us.  Will miss you. &nbsp;
I am extremely saddened by the news, I feel I lost a dear friend, someone who has been with me for over 30 years, I have bought practically every mac produced, and they have always been my most prized possessions, and they have helped me create everything I have ever created.  Steve was such an incredible person and businessman, I am sure he was also a wonderful father and husband.  I give my most heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.  Steve will always be remembered.&nbsp;
I didn't know him personally but I feel him at all times when using Apple products. God bless him. &nbsp;
I will always miss you. 
I can't begin to find the words to express the sadness that I feel at the passing of Steve Jobs. My sincere condolences to his family.
 Condolences to his family and his friends. This man has inspired many people around the world including myself.  He will live on in our memories. Forever immortal through Apple.  Rest well Steve Jobs.
You were a legend Steve. You left us far too soon. Your masterpiece of the iPhone and all the iDevices have greatly changed the world in how we all do things. I'm very sad you are gone and I don't believe we will have another person like you again in my generation... RIP my friend. You will not be forgotten. &nbsp;
Our condolences to Steve Jobs' family &amp; to Apple family... Thanks for creating the iPhone &amp; iPad for people all over the world to use! God Bless!
 Gracias por haber cambiado la vida de millones de personas, tu imagen transmitin valores de un ser humano excepcional, un modelo a seguir y tu vida  y como la viviste una inspiracion . El mundo entero te recordara siempre. Gracias&nbsp;
R.I.P Steve. &nbsp; We are going to miss you.
Dear Lauren and Steve's family: Sorry for the lose of your husband. Thanks for your husband to done a lot to the world and me. Thank You.&nbsp;
Such a wonderful, inspiring individual. The design community owes him for creating global awareness and appreciation of our field. A true visionary.&nbsp;
Dear Jobs Family, Like a painter, Mr. Jobs was a creative-visionary genius.  Creating works of technological art many people would have never imagined.  But, like a master painter, what he leaves behind has forever moved us.   There will never be another person like him.   Sincerest condolences to Mr. Jobs family and friends.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is known through his creative genius, but he has touched so  many people only others could dream about. His life was a celebration of  awe-inspiring brilliance. He made the world a better place for millions.  This is an accomplishment online a lifetime can achieve. I only wish he  could have lived longer.  RIP Steve. 
I didn't know you, but I feel like I did because of your work, Godspeed Mr. Jobs!&nbsp;
<div style"font-family:""="" 'times""="" new""="" roman';""="" font-size:""="" 16px;"""="">Thank you Steve.&nbsp;For making it possible to handle a computer for a nerd like me.&nbsp;My condolences to all who loved him. <br _moz_dirty""""=""><br _moz_dirty""""=""><br _moz_dirty""""=""></div> 
he changed the world he made it a brighter place to be men; such as he seldom pass this way; we are all fortunate to have been in his path&nbsp;
May his family find solace in the fact the Mr. Jobs changed the world for the better in a way few can even hope to match.  Thanks for everything Steve.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the most incredible innovative person the world has had the pleasure of seeing in a while. I don't think there will be someone like him again for a very long time and I am saddened by his passing. Apple products have truly changed the world forever in an amazing way. I must have my iPod Touch with me at all times and this product has made me happy and helped me out time and time again, thanks to the innovative mind of Steve Jobs. Although he is gone, his legacy will live on forever. My condolences to his family, and may he rest in peace. 
He made me a believer.  Thank you, Steve for opening up a whole new  world to so many people...  
rest in peace steve jobs god bless you 
My Deepest Regrets to Steve's Family, Friends and co-workers.  The world lost a person today who made the world more interesting.
Thank you for change the world and make my life easier.&nbsp;
Our thoughts and prayers to Steve's family, friends and Apple staff... truly an inspiration!
I'm shocked at how sad I am. It feels like innovation itself has died. 
You touched and changed my life in a way I had never imagined before. Your keynotes locked out everything else in life. Your speech at Stanford blew me new life. Your inventions make me smile and happy and comfort my life with every touch and look.   Thank you Great One for appearing in my time. You feel like family going away. Tears and cries are bursting out and I find it very very difficult to write without seeing the keyboard through all the blur. Thank you for uncountable  moving moments your various speeches and appearances, the arrival and unpacking of my first iDevice and all the others that moved and will continue to move me, now even more so since it will remind me for my remainder that you will be missed inexpressibly.  Thank you Steve!
And thank you thank you. You were great; peacefully. I pray its soul may rest in peace.
Me and many Brazilians fells the pain in our hearts for this lost. Jobs,  rest in peace. 
Just sitting here thinking how much more enriched my life is because of my M ac Mini, MacBook, iPhone and iPad. I'm Apple to the core. RIP SJ.
 Too soon to loose so great a talent.  Deepest sympathy to Steve's family and friends. Sincerely, Jan, a benefactor of his work 
Remembering you FOREVER. 
I never had what I would consider the absolute honour of knowing Mr.   Jobs, yet some how I feel, like many do, that I was mentored by him   even in the slightest way. Steve Jobs gave us so much; his vision   never stopped at Apple. I am reminded of the risks he took with Pixar,   an example of passion larger than the definition itself.  I know that Steve Jobs will be remembered for being more than a great   CEO, he'll be remembered for what he represented.  Thank you, Steve Jobs.  My sincere condolences to his family &amp; friends.&nbsp;
Your contributions to society and popular culture have been huge.  Thank you.  Rest in peace, Steve. 
Thanks for making our world a better one. 
I will continue to change people's lives by inspiring my customer's to  use apple products to make their lives more productive in positive ways  forever!
I will miss you forever. Maybe God need you for his apple computers. Rest in peace. 
A genius who's creativity and talent will be seen and remembered for  generations to come.  ALWAYS wish I could of met Steve, unfourtunately that day will never  come.   rest in peace Mr.Jobs 
RIP Steve!  You were such a visionary…
 The news of Steve Jobs death was quite a shock. I send my most sincerest condolences to his family and friends. Steve Jobs was a phenomenal individual who made people around the world dream bigger and realize that they did not have to settle for anything. I thank him for his vision, his meticulous eye to detail and most of all sharing his knowledge with the world.  You will be terribly missed.
I remember my mom brought home an iMac, I want to say, the summer of  2005. I was younger at the time and wasn't aware of the sheer genius put  into it by possibly the greatest (and smartest!) man i've ever seen. I  know this is short, but I wanted to share my condolences to the Jobs  family and the iGeneration, RIP Steve, you will be missed. 
Ça me touche.  Comme si c'était un proche.&nbsp;
The pain of loosing such a leader is so deep that noting can heal. He had built such a deep connection with his consumers that we felt we knew him so closely and anyone talking against Mr.Jobs had become a personal issue. Such amazing was his style of wrok. Such an effective personality was he. There is none like him and no replacement to him  My condolences to his family and close friends  Steve will always be remembered&nbsp;
He changed the world and now he's left it. We will forever remember him  for the way he changed our lives.&nbsp;
A great man is gone, but leaves a great legacy, do not forget you, rest in peace.
There may be much back and forth about the minutia of his life and his legacy, but there is no debate that he was the Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, or Walt Disney of this generation. R.I.P. Steve Jobs -- as great an innovator of progress as there ever was.&nbsp;
His products are his defined legacy. May God speed.  
I can't believe that it really happened. I will forever have a place in my heart to remember the greatest man of our time.  Goodbye Steve.&nbsp;
Jobs, You were a visionary! Changed the world for years! We lost a big man!&nbsp;
Steve... thank you for changing the world the way you did, the way only you could do it. Thanks for making that dream we shared as kids "with communicators like in Star Trek" and many others come true. Thank you, your passion and your vision will live among us.&nbsp;
 We are saddened by the death of Steve. Our family uses iPhones, iMacs, iPod t ouches, iPods, and iPads. We truly appreciate Steve's visionary mind, dedication and drive to make our lives more convenient and more fun.  Thank you Steve for all that you did.
I'm sorry Steve's life was so short and glad he crammed so much into it. He changed our lives. I feel like we all lost a friend. My heart goes out to Steve's family.  Anne
He lived a joyful existence and brought joy to others.  Mission Accomplished.  Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was truly an innovator. My prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time. 
... i feel like the light has gone out. 
There has never been anyone else so inspiring.... Be in peace 
Thank you Steve! You will be missed.
I fell in love with Apple when I was in fourth grade. My dad gave me my  first laptop that he had borrowed from work and I remember sitting on my  living room floor playing around with paint and drawing programs. Almost  12 years later, I am now a college student and one of the biggest Apple  supporters. For me, Apple and Steve Jobs are synonymic. The work he has  done for this company over the last decade is pure genius. He is my geek  idol, and although he may no longer reside on this earth, the work he  has done while he was here will never be forgotten. He has truly changed the world, and allowed for so many people, myself  among them, to truly "Think Different."  Rest In Peace, Steve. 
Steve is really an influential person in the world.  Although I live very far from Steve, the technology that he believes and invented has brought us together and has brought the world together.  Through his work, the people in the world have come and united together with passion and with the longing to look for the designer's latest technology.  The magic he designed and worked on has brought a lot of passion, dream and expectation to people at all ages and levels and from different latitudes.  From Steve, we realise not just the power of technology, but the vision and passion of it.  Thanks, Steve.  Apple Team : please continue Steve's mission and we will all support Apple.&nbsp;
The genius/artist Steve changed my life. We both loved Kona Village on the   Big Island, and after meeting him there, I decided to learn to use a  computer.  Now I'm taking care of my husband, who has cancer of the esophagus. My  iPhone,  iPod, and iPad (yes, all three) get me through each day.  Thank  you, Steve.  We love you&nbsp;
He served steadfastly and was a shining example.Wishing him strength on his upward journey. May he awaken to joyful activity!&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs :'(  You will always be remembered in our hearts. 
If Steve could've done it. Why couldn't I?- My mentality of thinking.&nbsp;
Rest in peace Mr. Jobs.  You have been a continuous inspiration to me and  my creativity.  The world has lost a one of a kind creative genius and innovator.   You will be greatly  missed.  My condolences and respect goes  out to all family and friends. 
The world has lost a great leader and visionary.  His contributions and insight to the future will be missed.  He made good use of his limited time here  on earth.  Bless him and his family.&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs,  You will forever be in our pockets and at our finger tips.  You will never be more than a touch away.    I felt it was only fitting to frame you forever as screen shot from my Mac Book Pro.&nbsp;
My sympathy to the family of Steve Jobs, and to his colleagues and workers at Apple. &nbsp;The world has lost a true creative genius. &nbsp;May the folks at Apple find the inspiration to continue his work as he would want. &nbsp;May his wife and children find comfort in their time of loss. &nbsp;My prayers are with them.
 I feel so sad for his departure......   He was our friend, a great person  Rest in Peace, Steve .&nbsp;
  A true definition of a beautiful unconditioned and creative mind.  My Hero.  God Bless.  Prayed for him.&nbsp;
Few people in human history can truly claim to have "changed the world" -- and even fewer can claim that change was for the better. Steve Jobs will never be forgotten. One of the greatest Americans and human beings ever to walk t his earth.
Only a genius can create something that many never dared to imagine  --&nbsp;
Thank you for your contribution to human being and changing our life habit.&nbsp;
when i first got the news of the untimely death. i could not help but to  cry and say "why god?" i will always remember Steve Jobs, he was an  innovator and genius. Now i will go and honor him by tattooing the apple  logo on my body. My whole family will always love and miss you Steve  Jobs.&nbsp;
Thanks for creating great things and changing the world :0)&nbsp;
The world will miss him. When I bought my first computer in 1988, it was an Apple. I never bought  anything other than an Apple since then. There is no other device to  compare it to. All of Apple's products are extraordinarily  user-friendly, and I have no doubt this is largely due to the vision of  Steve Jobs. My hope and prayer for the human race is that other  visionaries will find their way into the very fabric of our lives in an  effort to create new avenues toward ease and wonder in our world. And I  hope they will look to Steve Jobs for both example and inspiration. Thanks, Steve
Not many people in the world have the profound opportunity to change   the direction of human beings on the grand scale.  The ones who are   provided that opportunity usually do not - at least not in the way   that Steve Jobs has.  He is among the few people in this world that   has had such a single-handed impact on us as human beings.  The   effects that he and Apple have had on us are not just ones that we   discuss and analyze, but we get to experience them first-hand.  Any   Apple product that I have ever used is not just a mere object.  From   the time I turn it on, it becomes an extension of myself.  A clean,   clear, precise, organized, navigable extension of my own body.  It is   me, and I suffer from separation anxiety when I am deprived access to   it.  My car does not even come close to the proximity of Apple to my   heart.  Thank you Steve Jobs for driving a company that has made the   world a better place for me.  You've played the game of life ever so   brilliantly.  Well done, sir. &nbsp;
I pray for all of the family members and close friends of Steve Jobs. He sounds like quite an amazing guy and truly transformed everything the world is today. May he rest in peace.&nbsp;
Bye Mr Jobs, I would like to thank you for shared with us your great genius. You will be one of the most beautiful minds of all time. Thanks  for improving through your technologies, our lives. &nbsp;You will always be an  inspiring mentor for the next generations. One day I hope to be like you  and with this big sorrow I have to say that from today the world is  poorer without You!  Rest in Peace! 
To all his family my most sincere words. Thanks Steve for all the amazing work you will be miss... &nbsp; &nbsp;
To the family and friends of Mr. Steve Jobs,  I would like to offer my most sincere condolences and prayers for your loss. I would just like you to know that I will celebrate Mr. Jobs' legacy by continuing to be a member of the Apple ecosystem of products. After all, Mr. Jobs is a hero in my eyes for simplifying and entertaining people's lives simultaneously. Additionally, Apple's impact on the education of the world is tremendous, and the use of the iPad in this area exponentially increases that impact. While I regret not being able to meet and thank the Apple team in person for these products, Mr. Jobs' attention to detail and passion for these products is clearly visible with every swipe, tap and pinch I perform. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to give thanks through this medium, and once again, my prayers are with you all.  A true Apple fanatic.
Apple, I really hope you carry out Steve's legacy and really make him proud. I  am a big fan of apple and always will be. You guys are amazing and ahead  of everyone in the technology industry. I really hope you do something  to remember Steve like a huge offer or a idea he had and actually make  it or dedicate a new line of apple products to him. I know you will do  the right thing. RIP Steve Jobs you will be missed.  Customer and supporter of apple forever
I am very sorry to hear of Steve's passing. Please accept my deepest sympathy and condolences.&nbsp;
I am a computer company owner, and I appreciate the greatness that steve was  able to accomplish. It is a great loss to world when someone who can make a  difference is gone.  I hope his vision keeps living.
Thank you for all you have done for us all. You left us with magic and wonder and most importantly you inspired generations. RIP SJ.&nbsp;
I am 25 years old.  Steve Jobs was our generation's Albert Einstein. 
Mr.Jobs, You have changed the world on your own&nbsp; with all of&nbsp;your great innovations . Thank you ! what would i do without my iphone4, ipad2 and my ipod. may you rest in peace. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
You were a role model to society. You had a way of taking care of people when they needed the most. No CEO have cut his salary to get his company a float. Thanks for everything  Technology have change for ever because of you.
Im truly sorry about the lost, we all loved him, great man, a genius man  and hiss memories and his technology will me known to be the best. He  was a legend! 
I always had a passion for technology but I was in a PC world. After I was introduced to iPod and iPhone I began to seek out Steve and his passion. I became an Apple and Steve news junkie. Today I share my passion for Apple and technology to others just as Steve once did. I thank him for showing the world a new direction to be able enjoy life and make each life a little better. I am thankful for all he did and I take a little piece of him with me everyday. Thank you Steve.
I'm sorry to hear that Steve Jobs has passed away.. I was dumbstruck when I heard. My condolences.
I am sincerely sorry to hear of the death of Steve. He was a beautiful man who had a dream, made it happen, and gave the world his vision of the most wonderful form of communication using the world wide web. He will be missed by us all. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and all who know him.&nbsp;
 I don’t have Iphone or IPod but I can feel and see the great change Steve Jobs brought to this complex world, he united it in his visions and creativity. Millions  own Apple products all over the world.   May you find peace and a painless world…              
Steve, I unfortunately never had the privilege of meeting you in person, but I want to take a moment to thank you for the impact you've had on the world and myself as an individual. The way you created, and then later returned to rebuild Apple into the world's most valuable company, inspired me to study the world of business during my years at University. At the time I thought I made this decision personally, but I realize now, only after you're gone, that it was you who inspired me and pushed me onto this path I currently find myself on. I will forever look back at that decision, one of the most important of my life, and remember how your unique ability to inspire had a profound effect on my world. To Laurene, Steve's children, and every member of the Apple family, my sincerest condolences during this time of mourning and remembrance. Steve's spirit and undeniable determination to "Think Different" will live on in all of us.&nbsp;
I did not know Steve. I use many apple product every day at home and at work  and I am just thankful for all he has done to create a wonderful company and amazing life changing products. May his memory always be as a blessing.
Although I never really "knew" him.. Strangely a part of me feels missing now. Apple has been more to me than just hardware and software, rather a sense of family. Thank you for everything you have given us.. Thank you for giving us that sense of belonging.     Rest In Peace 
I feel really sorry for the loss of the most amazing  and innovative person the world had, thanks for being such an amazing  human being and thanks for change the world. There are 3 apples that change the world: First one, Adam and Eva,  Second one,  that wake up newton, third one, that Steve Jobs create.
Steve was my hero. plain and simple. He inspired me in so many ways i  can't even begin to count. he was a true visionary and business man that  always worked towards something until it was perfect. Those who worked  with Mr. Jobs should feel honored and privileged to work with and for  such a talented innovative person who changed the world and lives of  many. My dream in life was to one day meet and work for Mr. Jobs. i have  and will always hope to be exactly like him, turtle neck and all. i send  out my condolences to his family and friends. I cant begin to imagine  how hard this must be for them because i myself started to choke up a  bit when i heard the news. Steve and I both started with technology at a  young age, i was about 5 and now 15 and have come a long way and i have  always tried to follow the footsteps of Steve. I have always looked  forward to getting home from school watching his keynotes for apples new  devices and products, but most of all i looked forward to seeing Mr.  Jobs present it. He did it in a way that no one else could, he's truly  unique in my eye and i'm sure in many others. Steve will always be loved  and missed and never forgotten. Rest In Peace Steve. 
To the Jobs family and the whole Apple family,  I send my condolences to all of you. Steve Jobs is a technological GENIUS. His work has changed the world. His work will continue to inspire me for the rest of his life. He will be missed. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs.  Bless all of you
  Steve was a visionary and he will be missed so much by everyone. In this sad time, I wish his family the very best and we all join them in grieving their loss. He was taken too soon from his family and his Apple family. RIP Steve!&nbsp;
I wanted to see Steve Jobs create a game console before dying. Guess i will never see that. LOVE YOU STEVE!!! 
Thank you&nbsp;mr. jobs&nbsp;for making a difference in people's lives&nbsp;
you will be greatly miss. i love apple and its all because of your great work. May the Lord be with you.
   People like Steve Jobs do not come along everyday. He was a special,  one of a kind human being. He brought the world into a future that no  one could have ever imagined but him. He will be missed by many. God bless him and may he rest in peace  knowing he brought so much to so many.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve, for making our civilization a better place. You are   a true inspiration and role model. You will always be remembered. My   thoughts go to Steve's family.  PS: So many thoughts, yet so little words to express them.&nbsp;
You're the person who made impossible into possible. You made it real what others called foolish! You caged the world into crazy devices. Just cant realize the fact you're no more! The iworld salute you Steve! May you Rest In Peace! &nbsp;&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for your vision to "Think Different." The technology world is a better place because of it. RIP.   
Hello,  I really hope M. Jobs that you lived your life the way you wanted. Thank you for what you have bring in our world, we won't forget you.  A big word of courage for your family and friends, both have lost a  great man today.  Rest in peace Steve...   
Es para mi un gran dolor saber que alguien tan grande como Steve ha dejado este mundo, solo me queda decir que estoy con ustedes expresándoles mis condolencias y espero que el allá donde se encuentra este muy bien, espero todo haya terminado sin dolor para el Descansa en paz Steve Jobs
Dear Apple, Sorry for the loss. I didn't personally know the man, but I looked up to  him. His brilliance and his attitude towards life was inspiring. Its  funny how a man you never met before can have such an impact in your  life. The way we use entertainment has been changed because of this  man's brilliance. He created true competition and was always a step  ahead. It's not a sad day for tech nerds, but it is a sad day for  everyone to have lost a visionary, a genius.
We are saddened. We are torn apart. We will miss you Steve..... Entire humanity will miss you.....  And death is the destination we all share.&nbsp;
He didn't invent the computer, he made it better..   He didn't invent the music player, he made it better...   He didn't invent the telephone, he made it better...   He did invent the tablet, he made it better...   Thanks for everything, Steve Jobs...a true innovator of our time and of our world.. He didn't change the way we do something, he changed the way we do everything.
Steve,  You were a visionary.  Our kids will be reading in their school textbooks about your success to the like to Thomas Edison !  Rest in peace, my families thoughts and prayer go out to your family and friends!     THANK YOU!
The loss of steve jobs is both a loss to the world and to technology. His enthusiasm and innovative thinking will truly be missed.
His visions will resonate throughout time.   Most interesting man anyone can think to meet.   May god bless him and his family.  
 Steve Jobs A visionary, director, a great man.  Rest in peace. &nbsp;God receives you. Your family and your friends receive a peace that passeth all understanding. Hugs.
Here I am, typing on a Mac, to share with you all how sorry I am by the decease of Steve Jobs. I'm extremally thankfull for his work and know that I'm privileged to have shared Earth with such a brilliant human being.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for being a great humanitarian and visionary. Even though you have physically  left us, what you have done will continue to inspire mankind.Well done sir and may you rest in peace with a smile cause you sure gave me one every time  i use my Mac  :) 
You will be miss.... I was always fascinated by all you innovations and  being such a different person always thinking different ... Rest in  Peace
Today I woke up to the news that the man responsible for the technology that has truly enriched my life had passed away. So I verified this on my iPad, texted everyone on my iPhone and sent this email on my Macbook pro. Without Steve Jobs, these products, and the products they inspired wouldn't have existed. Remember and recognize. 
I didn't know him personally and the first time I heard his name was because I watched the keynote release on iPhone 3GS.  But the world has lost a great man, great visionary and talent. A man who went against all odds to take on what he knew was going to shake the world and take over technology. The man who envisioned and made all his visions happen. The man who did not stop at achieving the best and got even better. The mastermind behind every Apple product I use daily.  Mr Steve Jobs, thank you for having changed the world with your ideas because you bothered to make them happen. You will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
An example of life, a visionary, his life is an inspiration to this world!
He has influenced technology broadly...such a visionary &amp; innovative man. He left an indelible mark in this world.
I was the first medical student at The University of Michigan to use a computer to transcribe class notes for general use -- back in 1983, thanks to an Apple.  And I've been a loyal fan ever since.  Best wishes to Mr. Jobs' family,&nbsp;
I am sad he passed, but glad he lived. In his life cut too short, Steve redefined the world we all live in and made us better people. In 1985 my family bought our first "Mac" and life changed for all of us. To be the creativity of MacDraw and use such a simple and transformative piece of magic was inspiring - today 26 years later I am a creative professional because of that spark. Many thanks to the two Steves who started all this going and great thanks to Steve Jobs for keeping Apple going! The world has been transformed and transfixed by his creations - that is the mark of a life well lived. Long live Apple- FOREVER remember Steve.&nbsp;
  Thank you, Steve, the world will never witness a second Jobs. You have changed the way we see the world. 
Steve... Thank you for the joy and the dedication, and to your family, thank you for sharing Steve with us.
I'm not surprised, but nonetheless sad that this warrior has finally   dropped his sword. He defined my career and my time with his vision;   as a graphic designer and artist trained in the early 80's, it's clear   to me that EVERYTHING changed in the world of design and graphic   production (to name one sector) because of Apple; from the Mac Plus to   the FX to the Quadra and beyond; if he was at the helm or not, the   engine kept pumping; when he finally came back things blossomed and as   a result, we are where we are today. What a man, what a visionary, and   what a bulldog! Godspeed my man into the expanding universe; see you   when it crunches back down!&nbsp;
Because of Steve, and Apple, I am a better person.  Thank you Steve. Thank you Apple.
Ever since I got my iPhone 3G, I have been in love with Apple products and so thankful for Steve Jobs and the Apple team giving them to us. Thank you Steve Jobs, and rest in peace.
I am truly very sad.  I left Pixar to test if I had just a glimmer of the vision he had.  To do it without a net.  And hope one day I could get a pat on  the back from someone who had changed the world forever.  It is not rational that I feel this deeply.  We never worked closely.  We were not friends.  But I got engaged in his story since I opened up the book t hat came with my Apple IIc when I was 9.  And I think for those of us that believe in out core that everything we do should matter - that in everything there is a sacred art- we have lost our champion.  And well miss that more th an the products  Thank you for everything, Steve.
Will be missed Steve. Everything important is Apple in my life because of your vision. See you up there... R.I.P.
Mr. Jobs remains an inspiration and a genius. Although I never knew him personally, from my first computer--the original blue gumdrop iMac--to the laptop that helped me get through two degrees, to the laptop I'm typing this on, I feel like I grew up with Mr. Jobs in a way.  But Mr. Jobs was more than the innovator behind Apple. While in the midst of over a dozen brain surgeries, I remember reading Mr. Jobs commencement address at Stanford where he discussed mortality among other things. While dealing with his own illness, Mr. Jobs articulated one of truths of life: "Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart." He succeeded wonderfully in doing exactly that and is a continuing inspiration to do the same.  My condolences to Mr. Jobs' family and his family at Apple.
I am sorry, this is truly a real loss!  Rest in Peace Steve.&nbsp;
The man who impacted the world with his revolutionary company will be sorely missed.  When I heard about his death, I didn't want to believe it.  
I'm sincerely sorry for my hero,  I can not believe this. He gives me one more lesson because I did not submit the my resume to Company Apple yet.  I will not delay anything for my life. Thank you, Steve, for the last lesson.
Dear family of Steve Jobs,<div><br></div><div>My family and I extend our very deepest condolences to all of you in the  loss of your dear loved one, Steve Jobs.</div><div><br></div><div>We never knew him personally, but were praying for him all these years,  knowing he was not well.</div><div><br></div><div>Out of all he's done for the world, which we have greatly benefitted  from, in the end, he figured it all out, that family is what really  matters in this world, and what you do with and for your family.  It's  such a refreshing thing to hear someone of the stature of Steve Jobs say  that.  We respect him even more for those words.</div><div><br></div><div>We pray he is, and know he is in the arms of our loving God, and  enjoying the benefits and splendid glory that is in heave with the Lord.</div><div><br></div><div>God bless you all and keep you.</div>
Steve, my first computer was a Windows 95 when I was age 6. I would go  to school and we would work on the eMacs. I always wondered why  so many schools had macs. My freshman year of college, I was so close to  buying a Mac but I just didn't think the price was right. I bought a  windows laptop and lo and behold it broke a year later. I knew what I wanted and purchased a MacBook Pro. I also purchased the iPhone 4. What you have done to technology is great. I applaud you on your  innovation. I hope you wrote down your plans for the future so that they  can be lived out. It would have been great to get an interview with you  when I finish my journalism degree but hey, life happens. &nbsp;Rest in Peace you great, innovative man.
Please receive my condolences. Apple family you lost a friend, a brother, a father and the world a genius and a visionary man. Steve's  family please let me send you a big hug.
I believe that he is legendary. &nbsp;He  died  but live in  our  hearts. &nbsp;Let us remember the great  man. He live in  our  hearts.
Thank you Steve. Wherever your energy now lives is a better place for it.  My thoughts are with the Jobs family.&nbsp;
Steve, I grew up as a pc user. A person who did not plan to join the Apple bandwagon. The computer was merely a device to do homework on. A laborious process it was one that I did not enjoy. But over time I grew up and as I grew your creations entered into my life. Slow at first and torrential soon enough, you and Apple became a much larger part of my life. From my music, to my phone, to my tablet you have fundamentally changed the way in which I travel, work, and communicate. I very rarely if ever am bored. People have spoken of you as the Thomas Edison of our time, but perhaps they have it wrong. Thomas Edison was the Steve Jobs of his time. Steve you inspire me and remind me of who I am suppose to become. I hope that you truly understood the incredible positive change you have given to this world. May you rest in peace, we remember you, and hope the best for you and your family.&nbsp;
Thank you for your vision and commitment to innovation.  My life has truly been effected by the Apple corporation.&nbsp;
I am sure this will be said over and over, but this entire world has been influenced by the genius that was Steve Jobs. Being a graphic designer, I thank him for helping make my job easier and fun. I hope he is a believer because I want to meet him one day. He has left a legacy that many generations will look up to in the years to come. Rest in peace. Thank you Steve for all you did for us. You are missed.  -
It's amazing how much 1 man can change the world. Now it's the worlds turn to change the world for mankind.&nbsp;
You have revolutionized the world! Rest in peace Steve Jobs.
Dear Apple family,  A huge part of what Apple is, was Steve Jobs. His ethos guided Apple Inc., ever since it's humble beginnings, the time it pined for his return, and its eventual ascendancy to the pinnacle of industry. Now, he is no more, yet he lives on in our hearts, minds, and almost everything we do. I am positive his  influence will continue, well beyond his short brief existence amongst us.   Wherever he is now, we wish him peace. My sincere condolences to his wife, children, and his larger family that he leaves behind. May we have continued strength to bear his passing.  
You change our life.  Your innovation make me smile. You Are Innovator. Thank You. Goodbye~ 
My prayers are with him and his family tonight! May he rest in peace! He  has truly made an incredible mark in history! Apple has brought so many  people together in times of happiness and sadness.   
The history of what Steve Jobs and WOZ created at Apple has always been a huge inspiration to me. It played a part in influencing me to study computer science, and later in becoming a professional software developer. I've been lucky enough to develop on iOS for the past 3 years. I know OS X and iOS all started with Steve at NeXT, and let me say, I've never had more fun developing on a platform. The down-to-roots development experience is unmatched, and a joy to work with. Steve's vision will continue to live on and will inspire people for generations to come. Rest in peace Steve, I'm going to miss seeing you in those blue jeans and black shirts. ;)&nbsp;
My condolences go out to the family and friends of this extremely  brilliant, yet humble man. He truly will never be forgotten. 
 I'm truly saddened for his family and loved ones. I personally didn't know the man, but I'm touched by his passing nonetheless. I'm not emotional by nature, but the news brought me to tears. May he be at peace, and never forgotten. Thank you for everything, Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
I bought my first Apple computer in 1986. It was a Mac Plus and haven't looked back since. Now 25 years later and at least 8 Apple computer desktops, 6 laptops, 6 iPhones, 5 iPods and raising my kids on Apple Computers we all feel a personal loss for a CEO we've never met? There he goes again.... making the impossible possible... thank you Steve...
Thanks Steve.  You gave me a career.
Steve:  Thank you for everything you did to entertain and empower mankind...The world is a much better place because of you.   RIP! 
In a world that rewards mediocrity and group think, he cared about beautiful design. We all owe him a great debt.
Why did he go so soon?&nbsp;
To leave the world better than you found it is such a dream.  For Steve Jobs it was a dream come true.  Thank you for setting the bar high and pushing the envelope.  The world has lost a true visionary.  Condolences to friends and family.  Their loss is felt in hearts all over the world.   
Hello apple, I'm a 14 year old kid who lives in Brazil and deeply  admired Mr. Jobs work. I felt extremely sad to hear that he passed away.  My heart goes out for him and his family.You will always be remembered Steve Jobs. 
Thank the day you were born. My condolence goes out to  your family.
Steve, thank you for everything. This world loses a great men. In heaven for ever.&nbsp;
46rom a little and lost island in the Atlantic...  Thanks for making millions of people PLAY...
Thank you for setting an example. Your spirit will stay with us forever.  
I am truly sorry to hear the news of Mr. Jobs' passing.  Mr. Jobs was a truly innovative man who touched many peoples lives.   His creations definitely touched mine. No doubt about it.  I'm honoured to have such marvelous products created by Mr. Steve Jobs. You have my sincerest condolences.  Please continue his work, passion and vision.  Steve Jobs will be greatly missed.&nbsp;
My condolences to Steve's family, friends and love ones, and to all of  us that he shared his genius.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs:  We will never forget your courage and innovation to the world. We love your legacy. 
This is a true tragedy for the world, for the industry, for any person in the 21 century. It is a very sad moment, and it is probably late but not too late to say how much we appreciate and admire what Steve has done for everyone. I am writing this from Russia, holding an iphone in 1 hand, an Ipad in another hand and having a macbook on my desk. It is hard to express how sorry I am that one of the most talented people of this century has passed away. I am  grieving with probably the half of the world right now, and I am so sorry for Steve's wife and family. I cant imagine how wonderful it was to live, talk and take care of a person like Steve, a genius, and how difficult it is to  lose him now. Thank you so much, Steve. You will never be forgotten. RIP.
Nothing can delete him from my memory. 
To the legendary steve jobs, may you live a better life up stairs. This world couldn't have done it  better without you, the genius who shifted the whole world's mobile  technology. Although I have not met you, from those who have has said you  were a superb guy full of joy and care.  Rest in peace Jobs!  You'll be missed.&nbsp;
Our small family has grown up with Apple products. My children love Apple as I do. Tonight, my 15 year old told me of Steve Jobs death with true sadness in his eyes. With so much of our lives influenced by the amazing products Steve made for us, I had not realized how Steve Jobs became part of our extended family. But he lives on through Apple and the amazing things you will do in the future. Thank you all.&nbsp;
Thank you for your amazing products and your vision  with respect to our electronic world!! You are such an incredible human being, Thank you!!
"Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" - Steve Jobs&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;A motto I will always fall back on when times get rough in my life! Thank you for all you have done in the advancement of mankind!&nbsp;</div>
Steve,  You will be missed and always remembered. You have inspired millions with your dreams. You have given others the ability to dream. Your work and inspiration will live on with Apple and through everyone who uses Apple products. &nbsp;
MY HEARTFELT CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY.  STEVE INSPIRED ME TO JUMP INTO  MY MAC.  HE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO "NOT BE AFRAID" TO GET ON THE  MAC.  MAY GOD SUPPORT HIS FAMILY AND BRING THEM COMFORT AND SOLACE. 20  I HAVE PATIENTLY BEEN WAITING FOR THE IPHONE 5.  HOWEVER IT CAME OUT AS  THE IPHONE 4S.  EVEN IN HIS ILLNESS HE PUSHED FORWARD!!!!  GOD REST HIS SOUL.  CORDIALLY.
   STEVE U HAVE BEEN A GREAT INPIRATION FOR EVERYONE IN THIS WORLD TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS. You Will never leave our memories....NEVER!!.....The Heaven Needed a New CEO..Thats How AMAZING YOU ARE!!!        RIP Steve....WE LOVE YOU!!..FOREVER!!!!              
I'm surprised at how it affects me to learn of the passing of a man I never knew.  I always detected a feeling of him being a kid in a candy store when he'd announce some cool new technology and he was getting to share his "candy" with everyone else.  I felt a kindred spirit with this man who loved technology and  the evolution of it.  Tonight I'm mourning what would have been and knowing that I'll never see the youthful exuberance with which he presented his visions.  My condolences to his family and his friends.  I feel sure they know that there are many of us who are happy to have been on the planet the same time as him. &nbsp;
Thank you Steve for shearing your visions with the world!
Steve,   Thank you for making the world a better place!&nbsp;<div><br></div>
I think we all users mac feel a bit concerned about this bad news. I  don't have to much to say just that we will miss Steve. He somehow  changed our vision of the world by his thoughts. &nbsp;My condolences to his family and to Apple as well. We'll miss you Steve... 
He. Will. Be. Missed.&nbsp;
Descanse en paz Steve Jobs. Mis condolencias a la familia. 
The world has indeed lost a true visionary.  This world is a much better  place due to Steve's many contributions.  I feel immense sadness for  this loss.  I hope his family finds comfort in the world's admiration  for this wonderful human being.  May Steve rest in peace.
To Steve: I get to know you through my husband and his passion for Apple. I  followed you amazing journey and here I am, with deepest sadness,  thanking you for your extraordinary mind and heart. I will miss you and  my prayers are for you and all yours. Rest in peace.
When I first heard the news that he was diagnosed having a pancreas cancer, I offered him a silent prayer. Hoping that he could somehow create a technology that could help cure his disease. And now, the first engineer who designed the first ever desktop computer, after years of battling his pancreas cancer, had finally put himself in the hands of God. May God bless you as you glide yourself up in Heaven. I will forever be a follower of your works and a fan of your creations. I offered my deep condolences to all of his family, loved ones, and friends.  Thank You so much for all the contributions you have shared on us Dear Sir. You will always be remembered.&nbsp;
Deep condolence to Mr. Steven Paul "Steve" Jobs.  Mr. Steve Jobs, one of the greatest American leader in history, extremely brilliant and super smart man.  You has contributed much to human's creative &amp; intellectual history,  Thank you for all of your great innovation. May you rest in peace.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs 1955 - 2011 Here's to the smartest guy in the room.   Forever grateful for his unparalleled inspiration. He truly changed the world.
 Thank you for everything!!!! You literally changed the world with your kindness and with your amazing knowledge.
         With Deepest Sympathy     I pray the strength of your family in your time of lost.... I want to also thank the 1st lady Mrs. Jobs and your family for sharing with the world a man whom had a vision and did not rest until his vision prevailed...Truly this is a brilliant and loving person who have changed the lives of many people worldwide and may his dream live on through your family 1st and then to others for he will be truly missed. May the Lord God who sits on high bless your family.  With deepest sympathy! From My Family to yours.
Brazil is sad.
Working on Mac Pros in post production day in day out. Having a MacBook Pro and iPhone and iPod. Steve Jobs and apple has been a massive part of my life,  in education and now work. RIP "You could see it when we couldn't"&nbsp;
Even never having used an apple device i feel a great sense of loss for  the apple family, the jobs family and the world.  i am now typing this  on my 13-yr-old son's mac book pro, as i feel a strong urge to experience  the legacy that steve has created and left behind.
Steve you are a shining symbol of your generation and how true genius can make the world better. Your genius is the platform and foundation that will allow my generation the millennial to do GREAT things in this world. Because if you, my  3 year old daughter is two years ahead academically then her classmates all because of the learning apps on her Ipad. Thank you for all that you have done. Your influence will shine bright from now until the human race lights burns out on this earth.&nbsp;
As a society we are lucky to have someone come along with a  one-in-a-generation consciousness. Someone so transformative and  innovative that the world changes around them. Their ideas create new  horizons and new awareness of ourselves and open the door to future  discovery and innovation. Names like Jefferson, Einstein, Da Vinci, and  Hubble come to mind. Steve Jobs was such an individual. His vision and  the hard work of every employee at Apple has revolutionized nearly every  aspect of consumer technology and what we as a society expect of  technology over the course of his entire lifetime. His grasp of human  interaction will forever be beyond compare.
Steve  You will aways be an example of leadership, hard work, dedication, and above all, doing what you love. You will always be an inspiration for us. Thank you for changing our lives.&nbsp;
You set the world on its ear, and helped bring the computer to the mainstream, everyday family. May the world always remember your contributions to technology, business, and society in general.
My condolences for Apple family! We lost someone who inspired us to improve ourselves and other peoples lifes with new technologies!  Thanks for all! Rest in peace Mr. Jobs!&nbsp;
Thank you for making a difference... Your family and friends are in our thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;
My family and I wish to extend our deepest sympathy to the  family and  friends of Steve Jobs. May his next journey be a swift and safe one  to Heaven's  gates. And may he be welcomed with open arms by the angels. Rest in  Peace  Steve. Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
we've not only lost a human being but a person with a great heart and a  brain. Apple took a big leap due to Steve Job's effort and ideas.  Whatever Apple today is all because of Jobs! what a great man he was, an  icon without any doubt for this world. May he Rest In Peace. Due to his  accomplishments I've started using MacBooks and it's def worth the money  especially since Job has been behind it! 
He was on top of his work until his very last days. A great man who worked hard to make a difference. May God give him peace.
From the hours spent on my Apple-II in the 80s writing code as a teenager to the hours spent with my kids on our ipads &amp; iMacs &amp; iphones, you changed not only the world but my life in a way for which I will always be grateful.   The Jobs family has lost a great man and I can only imagine their sorry.  I send my sincere condolences and wish there were more men like Steve; men who work to make the world a better place.  Rest in peace &amp; Thank-You for all you did.&nbsp;
Steve,  You reached my soul with your vision's and changed the world for all. You will always be remembered for all that you touched.  Rest In Peace Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
thank you for being that person who gave me the inspiration to follow my goals!  Great Job, Steve! we´ll miss you.
Steve Jobs was a hero to a very dear and close friend of mine. My condolences to Steve Jobs and his family and friends. He will not be forgotten.   
Dear Steve,   I have started my computer life with your Apple II+, and I am writing this e-mail with your iMac now. We owe you. Steve.&nbsp;
An amazing American visionary.  Thank you for what you have done for the world.  Our deepest sympathies to his wife and children.
Steve Jobs was an inspiration for all creative and thoughtful people. He spent his life helping us to see the possibilities. Long may his vision for the possible live.&nbsp;
Wherever he has gone, he will reinvent it.
You were an  influence to us all Mr. Jobs. If only we could all strive  to help advance the world in ways that you have. You will always be  remembered. Coming from a long time apple nerd, I am personally saying  thanks from the bottom of my heart for all of the wonderful products you  helped create! 
Sorry for  your loss, an inspiration never dies. Rest Steve, Peace!&nbsp;
Thank you for the wonderful technology you gave the world. Your name will be remembered forever. Rest in peace knowing you did you job well and you were a amazing person. Thank you again.
I just wanted to email and say that he was one of my heroes, and there  won't be anyone ever like him in a million years. I remember learning  about him in 5th grade, then I just stared researching about Apple, and  eventually got my own MacBook Pro. I will miss him so much!
Without you the creative world would have not had a voice in the digital age. Many of us would have been lost without your creativity. Many owe their careers to you and I am one of them. It is sad that you are gone, but the world is happy and a better place to have known you were in it.    I bow to you Mr. Jobs...thank you from the bottom of my operating system which had you all over it.&nbsp;
My condolences to his family and close friends.  His leadership has inspired many. He set a standard for innovation and design that I strive for daily. For that I am most grateful.  Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
I am a bit older than Steve was, and my first computer was a Mac. I've been using Apple products ever since. He built a company that makes user friendly and really fun products. He will be missed.  Rest in peace Steve Jobs&nbsp;
a losing to the world, but he must be to sense the presence of God filled with tranquility and proud of the company that left. his family, friends and colleagues I send a big hug from Colombia. with the comfort of knowing that Steve is in sense the presence of God I say goodbye.&nbsp;
 Not much to say but thank you Steve.. The rockstar in the tech world... You m ade this tech world a better place.. There will never be another. REST IN PE ACE!!!!
I remember reading an article in an investment magazine many moons ago about Apple's Initial Public Offering. It was then and there that I fell in love with Apple.  Steve Jobs always made it that way. It was a labor of love for him which turned into a love story for all Apple faithful. We will miss you Steve! Peace and love.
Dear Steve,  Bye..... Stay with God, wherever you are ! 
I am so sorry for this lost. As a customer, I can tell that Steve always amazed me with so brilliant  and innovative products. I am a BIG FAN OF APPLE. God bless the soul of this great guy.
The World had lost a Great Man!
Steve Jobs was a true maestro.  He has touched my life and the lives of my family in many ways for many years and to you, I say a heartfelt thank you.  We will miss you but will think of you fondly every time we fire up our iMac, MacBookPro or iPod.  Rest in Peace.
Hi, I'm Kimin from South Korea. I heard about his death today. I'm so sorry to hear that. I read the book that is about Steve Jobs several times. I want to respect his courage. And I bought iPod because it was made by Steve Jobs. I'm so sad to hear Steve Jobs' death and I hope Apple to be one of the great company in the world. And I hope new CEO of Apple make iPhone 5.&nbsp;
To the family and friends of Steve Jobs you are not alone in your grief.    What a giant we have lost.  A one of a kind class act.  Our hearts are  broken.  We don't even know how much we have lost.  Rest in peace dear Steve.
He changed the way we listen, the way we watch, the way we interact, the way  we communicate, with style simplicity, with grace.
Steve Jobs,        You left us far too soon, I'll admit, I've always wanted to have the chance to meet you one day. You are an icon, a dreamer, and a brilliant human. May we all try and look through those Big-Picture eyes you've been gifted.        Because of the technology you have dreamt and created, I am now able to pursue my own dream of becoming a filmmaker. Without Apple, this dream never would have begun... it's a long story,  but I hope to tell it to you sometime, later on.  Thank you, for everything. I already miss you, Apple man.
How sad to learn that Steve Jobs has passed on, such a short life for such a brilliant person! What he did for Apple, Pixar and all of the computing world will be felt for a long time to come. Best wishes to his family.
Without him, Music may never sounds so good... Graphics may never looks so amazing... Apple may never be the brand so inspiring... To the visionary man!! 
This man had the brilliance, wisdom, vision and qualities of leadership  that set a bench mark, so generations can learn from him, and we will  certainly have more like him in the future since he is an example to  follow. Our heart felt condolences to his family, friends and all  touched by his work.
We lost one who changed the world. Hard to believe. No matter what they say he is the one.  Bye Bye Jobs.&nbsp;
I'm so sorry for the loss of such a great man, it's so sad to see someone so  great whose affected and changed so many lives die at such a young age. He will be dearly missed and in the hearts of people across the world. He was a great inspiration to me.  May he rest in peace and continue to inspire and change the world with every thing he's left behind and done.
Our heartfelt sympathies go out to the Jobs' family.  In no fewer words,  Steve was the best EVER!&nbsp;
We will deeply miss you, since you have defined the words "innovator" and "visionary" in its truest sense.  Your change and impact has significantly impacted this world, and the effects have rippled down to the extent of the letter "i-".  May God comfort and bless your family, as you rest in peace. 
I never met Steve Jobs.  I probably wouldn't recognize him walking down the street. But I feel his presence as I sit here typing on my computer.  There are some people in this world who are bigger than life.  Steve Jobs was one of those people.  His vision transformed the masses.  The way we work, play, communicate, almost every aspect of our lives was impacted by the vision in Steve's brain.  I think of Tesla, Edison, Einstein, Da Vinci.......  The list would not be complete without Steve Jobs.  What a tragedy that we left us so soon.  My condolences to his family, and to his colleagues at Apple Computer.
I'm really sorry about the lost of this amazing and unique human being.  I feel that I lost someone who's so closer and that have been a role  model for me and for my future. I know I was a total stranger to Steve but I feel this loss as a  personal one.You will be always remembered as the genius behind  all the concepts of Apple. Sorry again about this loss.
To folks of Apple,  I got a picture of Steve in my bedroom when i was in high school.  Because of him i pursued a career in IT despite taking business as my undergrad.  And no regrets, all too happy that i did.  He was my big big crush ever ever since.  Thank you Steve for being a big inspiration.    I love Apple, I love Pixar.  I love you.  Good bye to someone who has changed my life and the lives of billions of people.  Good night, Steve and God I know will bless your soul. 
<tzipporahrocks@aol.com><rememeingsteve@apple.com>I saw a tape of Steve's commencement address at a university, and I thought he was amazing.  Condolences to his family, friends and Apple family.  May G-d rest his soul now and forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;</rememeingsteve@apple.com></tzipporahrocks@aol.com>
I never knew Steve Jobs except as a figure in the news, but I've always been an Apple/Mac user since I computers first started showing up at school when I was small. Today, I work as a software developer, doing work that is so much more fun and fulfilling than I ever thought work could be, and if it weren't for my lifelong experiences using Apple products and, as a result, coming to expect that technology should be fun and accessible and intuitive and should really open up new worlds, I doubt I would be in the place I am now. Thank you Apple, and thank you Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Its my deep condolences to Steve's Family and his friends because a person of his caliber, personality, mind and human being are rare to be born. I am feeling too low on hearing what unexpected has happen and is taken aback by this news. I remember Steve from my heart and pays tribute to such a great man of this era.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Writing this email from Apple Macbook makes his remembrance more firm and I feel a close relative or friend has passed away. I may have not talked to Steve, not seen him in real , not touched him even not known more about him but I feel much sad, low and pain in my heart for losing him and a large empty space created to be filled by none. Its harder to accept this truth and I pray that May his Soul Rest In Peace .... Amen&nbsp;
 Steve was a lot of things to many people and will be missed tremendously. He will always live in our hearts.
Dear... I am your fan.   from now on. I am very sad. I pray to your and your family for peaceful time coming. &nbsp;
An Apple has fallen from the tree.&nbsp;
Dear Apple  Please accept my condolences, To tell you the truth i have never owned an Apple but no person deserves to pass away so early. My heart is with Steve's family anything i can do i am available.&nbsp;
I think the world has lost a visionary, and may His soul rest in Peace.  I am a huge fan of Jobs work.
I loved him greatly. I will miss him. I cherish his memory.&nbsp;
Dear Mr.Steve Jobs  Having lived the same time as you regards things as very honorable.  Please realize that the products which became a wind, and flew about all over the world, and you made are making the smiling face.&nbsp;
I would like to send my condolence to Steve Jobs family.  He has truly  changed my life and made me a lover of technology.  He was  a genius in  my book and he will be sorely missed. Don't  know if there will be  anyone like him again in my life time.  He will always be one of my  favorite CEO.  May his soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
 I believe you truly did change the world with the technology you  created. You gave us revolutionary products, that no one else will be  able to make.   Rest in peace Steve, your legacy will forever remain.                  
So many memories, and so many still working on Mac and iPods and  iPhones in my house!!  I'll never forget the first Mac I bought, back in 1985,  and the wonder  I felt as it booted for the first time, sitting there on my kitchen  table with that smiling Mac face, cardboard box and wrapping all strewn  around the kitchen!   I knew I was at the fork of a road, and that I was  looking at the beginning of a very different path for my personal  computing. What amazes me most is how many more times I have felt exactly that way  when unboxing another incredibly well designed and constructed Apple  product. My thanks to Steve for co-founding and then rejuvenating Apple and for  helping build a great team to carry on with the innovative spirit,  amazing design and quality build of software and hardware that serves  users instead of perplexing them. My condolences to his family, friends, colleagues at Apple and elsewhere  in the tech world.    My encouragement to those whom Steve has left  behind at Apple. We all still expect the next great thing from you,  because you all are who has been bringing it to us over these many  years.  Don't stop now!
What a great loss to the world. He was a true visionary. Condolences   to all his friends and family.  ￼&nbsp;
 Dear Steve Jobs  I am very sorry to hear of your recent loss.  Thank you Steve and I will miss you immensely.  Best Regards
Never so much before as today his words ring in my ears ..loud!  It is not just about what he created but the way he chose to live his life.  He hasn't died. He has just become immortal in history forever.&nbsp;
You were truly a creative genius... Your genius revolutionized the world... Rest In Peace 
A genius. RIP. You will be missed.  
A very sad day. God bless Steve Jobs. Thanks for the gifts Steve.  Thank you so much. Love and mischief to you friend I never met.&nbsp;
Ever since my first iPod, I have been drawn into the world created by Steve. He has and continues to inspire me to accomplish more, to challenge myself and others, and to do so with integrity. I am privileged to have been a witness to the monumental changes he authored. I am just so deeply saddened by his departure.&nbsp;
Hello. I have just found out that Steve Jobs has died this day. He was a smart man and many people in this world loved him for not only his work but for what an amazing man he was. I love Apple products with all my heart and will continue to buy Apple products for as long as they are made. On behalf of all my friends and family we appreciate what Steve has done for our world, changing it in ways some people would have thought to be impossible. Rest In Peace Steve Jobs. We all love you from the bottom of our hearts.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is an incredible human being. We are in a better place because of him. Rest in peace, Steve Jobs. 
Not to make his loss about me. It is about his impact on my life. That does not make it about me. It is all him, his vision, his singularity and perspicacity, his outside-the-box thinking, his unfailing dedication to quality, his  focus on making accessibility to end users like me. His is a life of unfailing worthiness. How his dearest ones must be missing him but how he prepared  them. There will not be another of his ilk in my lifetime. I honor his values and his memory.
May eternal light shine on you &amp; your family- My deepest condolences, God Bless and watch over all of Steve's family. 
Thank you Steve, Thank you Steve, Thank you..........   May his spirit rest in peace......&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. You helped make my entire creative life, career and business possible. You showed the world a passion for innovation to your last moments. You were an original...   
Such a sad day and one which will unite the world. Nothing too deep to say. Just want to be part of what I envisage will be 1BN people expresssing their gratitude for a truly great man.
A brilliant and genius human being! We need more like you Steve. You have well and truly earned your ticket with God..... Remembering you.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs. The greatest man in technology.&nbsp;<div>I looked up to him and continue to do so - dispite his death. &nbsp;I'm 14 right now and he's been my hero for a long time. &nbsp;His leadership has inspired me. &nbsp;I admire his want for perfection in  Apple's products, his strong and smart decisions. &nbsp;I admire his love for life. He's an amazing man and his ideas have touched everyone, especially me. &nbsp;I will say the same as everyone...he is an inspiration. &nbsp;One word so small but says so much - an inspiration.  R.I.P. Steve Jobs, "Stay hungry, stay foolish".</div>
Steve,  I know the battle and fight with cancer was tough and you were a real trouper through it all.    You're the only CEO who ever personally responded to an email that I sent to him, you were heartfelt in your response, and I will treasure that forever.    You had the guts and the balls to go your own way and lead us in your path.  You made complicated things so easy for all of us.    Yes, the world is a much better place because you were here Steve.    Thanks for everything, we will keep you, your family and the Apple family in our prayers.&nbsp;
 My condolences to the family of Steve Jobs.  Please find comfort in the fact  that he made our world better, helped us achieve our dreams, and provided an example for generations to come of how anything is possible.  Thank you for everything, the world will miss you.&nbsp;
As much as for his drive and genius, Steve's legacy includes his passion for design excellence, in products and in a company culture that has become synonymous for creativity, customer focus, and consummate attention to detail.&nbsp;
My condolences to all of Steve's friends and family. I simply wanted to say thank you for everything that he created in his life.&nbsp;
   Well, sorry if my english is bad, im from Venezuela, and well, i think that Steve was one of that persons that changed our worlds :/ in so many ways, id never knew him, i never will, but i just know that the world has lost a great person and a brilliant mind, our life its so easy thanks to his inventions and ideas! Its hard to believe that this happened! but well, hes better now! At last he’s resting!               
His spirit will remain as long as there are people using Apples all around the world. He would still be happy to see his company continue to flourish even though without  him. God bless Jobs and Apple.
I'm really sorry for the world´s lost, Steve Jobs was my&nbsp;idol and I'm very sad because of that. &nbsp;I will pray for his soul every day              R.I.P STEVE JOBSYou will always be on our minds.
I am a freshman in college right now. I wanted to send my condolences to  the family. The world lost the Edison of our time today. May his soul  rest in peace and may G-d bless his family.
I love what he created and it changed my life. RIP Steve Jobs. iSad. 
Thank you for make the difference! 
My condolences to the Jobs' family and employees and friends.  Mr. Jobs was such a blessing to the world.  May he rest in peace.
 His ideas revolutionized the world. He will be a legend, going down in history as our 21st century Albert Einstein.               
Dear Steve, You are an inspiration and a mentor.  As an employee of Apple, I am forever thankful to you for what you have done for this world.  I love working for this company and that is something that can be directly attributed to your vision and passion for what Apple is all about: the people. Thank you for everything.  I was hoping that during my growth in my career at Apple, I'd somehow bump into you at Cupertino and get to say hi and thank you for all you've done in person.  But I know that wherever you are now, you'll be receiving love and gratitude from a lot of the people in this world.  To the Jobs family:  I know that everyone at Apple and many other people are here for your support in your time of loss.  I send my love and condolences to you all.   Rest in peace, Steve.  Thank you for changing the world.
Goodbye and Rest In Peace...
He was a visionary and a great business man. The greatest CEO in corporate h istory. He approached a core belief with passion and vision: consumers can a nd MUST have technology at their reach. As a consumer, and now as part of the company he co-created, built and rebuilt into the most admired corporation in the world, I can only have praise an d continued admiration for him. As the people who stay behind, we must emulate his passion, insight and trus t in the better part of what being a human is all about. I am expressing this on a device small enough to fit in my pocket and powerf ul enough to put the world in my hand. All the gratitude to Steve, his leade rship and team for providing me this opportunity. We will miss you. I will miss you.
I am extremely sad when hearing the news. I have never met Mr. Steve Jobs before. But he is a great mentor to me. He brought us so many excellent products that combine the technology and art in such a subtle way that no one could ever reproduce. His experience, courage, pursuit of perfection encourage and inspire me always. It is so good to have Steve with us all these years. It is an honor to me. I really do not know what to say. The sadness has overwhelmed me. How I wish it is just a joke! How I wish I could see Steve standing there and introducing products for us! How I wish to see his smile again!&nbsp;
My sincerest condolences.  We have lost a great person, inventor, visionary.  May he rest in peace.
I'm a graphic designer of the same generation as Chip Kidd--in commercial  art school, we were the last to learn how to do pasteups, use a stat  camera, and master mysterious tools like ruling pens and phototypositors.  We were also the first to have the benefit of the amazing Macintosh (the  Classic, maybe. My first was a IIcx) which instead of being a scary,  impersonal machine, was a friendly face that told us everything would be  all right, that we could learn and create and dream. Thank you, Steve Jobs, for being the best kind of designer and human being.  And thank you Apple, for continuing in his legacy.&nbsp;
Many of us working with Apple products today, supporting ourselves and  our families while doing something we love, helping companies and  consumers to solve problems with amazing technology in an easy, natural  way started out using Apple products in our free time. Steve's visions  and Apple technology kept us going. Without Steve's inspring keynotes and the ground breaking products Apple  has come up with our lives and the world would not have been the same.  Working with Enterprise Mobility Solutions I know this is only the  beginning. Loving music, gaming and being creative I am thankful everyday for the  opportunity to work and play with Apple products.20 Your spirit will live on in all of us that was taken on this journey.&nbsp;
Thank you for your contribution to the world! Condolences to your friends and family-for your loss, they are in our hearts.
Steve Jobs, his charisma, his attitude, humor, intelligence has amazed me for over 20 years. He will always be remembered in my house and family. I was the first one to get an Apple computer in my family. Today there are 7 in my most immediate family. Not counting iPhones, iPods, iPads, apple tv, and others. He is and always will be part of our life. Big shoes to fill.  My dream job? WORK FOR APPLE. Some day. Like he once said ... "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on." RIP Man,... and Thank you so much for everything you have given to the world. 
Steve Jobs inspired so many. He will be deeply missed.   Thank you Steve for making our every day lives more simple and enjoyable with the many technology advances you have shared with us all.  Blessings to your family.&nbsp;
Lost Steve I feel very upset !
I am a Mac owner after years on a PC, but I have never been tech-savvy  enough to be one of those people who swear by Apple above all else.  I  don't understand enough about the advances in OS, or creative  applications vs. office software, and yet I have still been influenced  by the vision of Steve Jobs. I am of a generation that did not grow up with computers at our crib  side. We marveled at the large, hump-backed, bright-colored creations  that sat on desktops.  These machines looked odd and acted differently  than what we had already learned, such as it was.  We were beyond the C:  prompt, but we had no idea how much further into the future this man and  his dreams would take us, from Nanos to iPads; from $500 phones that  people stood in line for to commercials that won't soon be forgotten. His marketing mystique was as developed as his electronic genius, and  there are few of us that have not been touched by this man's life work.   Thank you and farewell, Mr. Jobs.
A great Apple day yesterday and a tragic one today. Steve Jobs just passed away. What a great man. He invented revolutionary and magical devices and software year after year and changed the computer industry to what we know it today. He will always be remembered as the risk taker who took his own route and always showed up at the top of the mountain above everyone else! You are loved and will be missed greatly. Thank you for changing my life and making me want to become part of the Apple family. Hopefully someday I will be a fourth of the CEO you were.&nbsp;
I'm not sure who's reading this or if it'll even be read but I figured its s till worth saying. Steve jobs was possibly one of the most influential visionaries of our time.  He revolutionized technology and in exchange revolutionized the world. With  his passing the world has lost our modern day Einstein. May his spirit watc h over the empire he built, and may that empire continue to flourish for many years to come.
Steve Jobs has always been someone I looked up to since I was a kid. He  has been an inspiration to me and made me push myself to reach my goals. I don't know where the business would be right now if Steve Jobs wasn't  around to influence so many people. I regret I never had a chance to  meet him, which was a dream of mine. I would like to say Thanks to Steve for  everything he's done and helped bring the world. He will be missed.&nbsp;
To Dear Steve Jobs: I am so sad to hear the news about your leaving, you have left so much amazing invention gifts to the human world. Here I just want to say thank you for your contribution and I have learned a lot from you.&nbsp;
Amazing man, his designs and ideas with live forever in the history of  technology.
I send my love and condolences to both the Apple company and Mr. Jobs' friends and family. He was a shaker of the world, and it is a hard loss to take. But while we may have lost a great legend, my heart goes out to those that lost a friend, a brother, a spouse, a father, and a son. He will always be in our hearts, and shall never be forgotten. Thank you.  
 Steve was one of those rare people who could see order in the chaos.  He helped us in so many ways. The world is a much smaller place today. Thanks for every idea Steve. Deepest sympathy to Apple and Jobs families.&nbsp;
You made me always go for the new, the unimaginable. And appreciate the simplicity. Thank You.
RIP Steve Jobs. Steve, you enlightened my youth with your visionary iMac with custom colors.  My elementary school had green and orange ones.  Oregon Trail ruled our world, and because of the allowance of your software and hardware, you were able to give us that freedom and joy. Around the world, people used Apple software and hardware to ensure the liberation of world citizens.  The unique and robust design of Apple computers has allowed for use even in the toughest situations. Every aspect of Apple has effected my life in the positive manner, and has allowed me to be the most productive person I can be. Steve, your philosophy on life and persistence has inspired me to be something bigger than what I am in physical form.  Your vision will stay with us, and Apple, for many, many decades to come. Thank you for changing the world, Steve...&nbsp;
Dear Steve, Heard the news of your passing away.  I wish I could write down how sad I feel, but I am only 3 now, so my dad is writing on my behalf.  I would like to dedicate my favorite toy, my mom's iPod touch to you.  I started using it when I was 8 months old when my dad handed it to me as a last resort to stop my crying.  Not only did it work then, it still works today. It has endured my baby food, my teeth, my popsicles, my juice and possibly anything that I ate or drank.   Over the years it has grown to be my favorite form of entertainment, starting from simple music to photos to videos, puzzles, games and these days I watch my favorite cartoon on it.  The fact that someone as tiny as me could use it so effectively is a tribute to your genius. We even got one for my grandpa and grandma so that they could carry memories of me with them. I will miss you and your creations and so will the rest of the world. May your soul rest in peace, love and hugs. 
He was a visionary, a creative and a genius, he was one of those that let us to be now connected around the world with a simple machine, with his dreams!  My condolences from Argentina.&nbsp;
The time I have dreaded has finally come. A man who changed my life has died. Apple products for the past 25 years have always been in my life. They give me pleasure, fun, education, thrills, and of course times of absolute frustration . They have been here for me in sickness and in health. They are a blessed addiction.  A brilliant man has passed on and will never be forgotten by me. I will miss him. The world will miss him. God bless Steve Jobs! An amazing gift to all people!!!!&nbsp;
Apple was nearly dead in '97 when Steve Jobs was asked to return to the company he co-founded, turning it into the most valuable one in the world and setting the standard for consumer and enterprise electronics. He helped Pixar become what it is today, changing the world of animated storytelling like he did at Apple designing technology solutions "that just work." He truly was a visionary and creative genius whose passing is a great loss to his wife and family; friends, colleagues, and employees; and many around the world. Time to watch "Toy Story" or any number of great Pixar features via iTunes on my Apple TV, or iPad, or iPhone, or iPod Touch, or MacBook... Here's to you, Steve!&nbsp;
 I'm glad to be part of Steve Jobs's Era.He was the most inspiring man of our times. God bless you Steve.
Our condolences from Empowerment Co., we develop apps for the iOS. We will miss steve, he inspired greatness, and he was a man who putted science to the service of humans beings. R.I.P Steve
My prayers are with Steve's family, I thank God for Steve's life.  Through his wonderful work creating Apple he changed my whole computing  experience. I just love my Apples Macs and I am so thankful that Steve  made my life so much more easier, I miss you Steve.
heartbroken over the loss of Steve Jobs. We cannot fully express our gratitude to him for living his life without fear. We will never forget him and take the inspiration he gave us into our daily lives. 
As a student studying new media at Temple University, I can say that if it's not Steve Jobs himself we are talking about, it is his innovations he has made to our lives. I can honestly say that we are all at a loss without him on the front lines of technology. My deepest, sincere condolences to his family and close friends. Mr. Steve Jobs, neither fire nor wind, birth nor death can erase your good deeds.
I hope you rest in peace man. This is the closest I will ever get to reaching you. I don't know you in person, I have never met you, I have never been a ble to know who you are. But I have seen the impact you have made, and I just want to let you know that you are an idol. And I will strive to become half as important or generous as you have been. R.I.P. Steve.  Your legacy will be remembered.
Since I was a child, I wanted to live in Silicon Valley.  The innovation and creativity that Steve used to develop what was a  simple idea into what Apple is today drew me to Silicon Valley. While I  lack the technological expertise, I consider Steve's role in my coming  to the valley to be integral and I hope to live by his words to live my  own life and listen to my inner voice.  Thank you for everything, Steve. You were more than just an innovator,  you were an inspiration.&nbsp;
Thank you, Steve. You really changed the world. Within the products you created, you live forever, I believe.&nbsp;
You will allways be remebered as one of the greatest visionaries of our  generation.
I am very sad to hear the news of Steve Job's departure. He has been a great innovator, who has a long living visions. Thanks to Steve for his contributions to the world, they will live long. Our prayers to his family for strength and courage to bear this loss.&nbsp;
Condolences to the family and the apple crew.
Hi, &nbsp; I am Mario from Indonesia. I'm not so a techno person. I always late for any changes in new technology. However, start from&nbsp;2008 my life was changed in regards to technology. I bought my first&nbsp;Apple product,&nbsp;iPhone&nbsp;3G. Steve Jobs's products has made me close and update for new technology. Suprisingly, it has made me more interested in tehchnology! Recently, I just bought iPad 2 to complete my Apple family. What a CHANGE  &nbsp; What can I say about Steve Jobs? He was an advocate of change. His passion, dream and spirit had made the world a new and better place to live. Excellent! &nbsp; Many thanks for your wonderful contribution Steve..
        God should save brilliant minds like that of Jobs. He still had much to offer humanity. He could not have gone so early.  Brazil says thank you for everything, Mr. Jobs.
I worked for Steve in Cork. I just do not know what to say, except that  he made a big dent in our world.
Dear Steve,  I know that you do not know me, or, that I had any ties with you. I would just like to say a very big thank you, for your contributions, to our modern technology. You gave us the greatest inventions of our times.&nbsp;
Our deepest condolences to family and friends. We are grateful to Steve for sharing his genius with the world. May he continue being a source of inspirat ion for ingenuity.
“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life,” Jobs said. “Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”  As a business owner, I love this quote. Condolences to his family. Be comforted in the fact he brought the world together and spawned many others to be creative, whether it be work wise, or otherwise.   He will be missed. 
Steve was the greatest and will be missed immensely.&nbsp;
Apple gave me a career with their products and innovation. Steve made me belief I could make it on my own. He will be greatly missed. Rest in peace my friend and mentor.&nbsp;
I am ever so saddened by the wolds loss of Mr. Jobs!  He will be forever  missed!
  Dear Steve,   Rest in peace, for God had a purpose for you on this planet, and that purpose has been fulfilled. Thank you for everything you have done, your legacy will never be forgotten.&nbsp;
I was extremely sadden by the loss of Apple's past CEO Steve Jobs' death. He has opened my eyes to the beautiful world of technology and music. I'm sure the whole company is having a hard time about his loss and you will be in my thoughts and prayers. Steve Jobs seemed to be the perfect example of a dedicated nice man, who will go out of his way to help others. I remember when the I-Pod nano came out and it was my first digital player, it was the best gift of my childhood. Now I cannot live without my iphone and macbook pro, even my whole school's electronics is all Apple products. I hope all of you draw strength to get through this tragedy. May God bless you all during this time and always.&nbsp;
Once-in-a-lifetime, people grace our world and bring a force with   them that leaves the world in awe of their vision, determination and   ability to mesh the two into something tangible.  We hang onto their   creations, hoping to catch just a tiny sliver of their magic!  The   most amazing thing about these once-in-a-lifetime people is that   when they go back into the universe beyond the stars, they don't   disappear.  They radiate.  Their magic remains and our world reflects   their brilliance in a whole new light.   Blessings to Steve's family and friends and co-workers....
 Thank you for all of the amazing things you brought into my life. Thank you for all of the wonderful ideas you inspired in my world. Thank you for never being satisfied.   
Mi mas sentido pésame!&nbsp;
I was deeply saddened to hear about your death. Who could think you would leave this world this early? I was hoping you would come back to work and surprise us with your innovative and amazing products. You've been the greatest leader and the most amazing creator. I believe your sprit will be here and keep inspiring people although you left this world. I believe the company you built and loved will keep surprising us. Rest in peace, Steve. We will never forget you. Thank you very much for your great job.
My deepest condolences for the lost. May He rest in peace. Thank you for being an inspirator for so many people, including me. I believe that you're in a better place now. God Speed, Steve.&nbsp;
HE WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!!! THANKS FOR CHANGING THE WORLD!
I joined the Cult of Mac in 2005 and haven't looked back since.  We lost  a brilliant mind and innovator who dared to "think different." I can  honestly say that Jobs and his company have influenced how I operate on  a daily basis professionally and creatively. One more thing... R.I.P. Steve. 
Dear Steve Jobs, Thanks a lot for creating the world's most valuable brand, being an  inspiring leader in Apple for years with amazing inventions and awesome  products with unbelievable features that none of the companies in the  world could produce. Without your contribution in future, Apple would  not be as powerful as now.  May you rest in peace Mr. Jobs, you will always be remembered in each and every of apple consumers.
Steve jobs, someone that changing the paradigm in designing and selling product. his live is very inspiring...
Thank you Steve for the creative and innovative products that you have shared with so many people.  I love Apple products and I will continue to enjoy and use the products in Mr. Jobs memory. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. 
My first computer was a 1989 Macintosh SE. My latest computer is a 2011 MacBook Pro. I even tried a Cube for a while.  Thank you, Steve, for your vision and your inspiration. You brought a lot of beauty into being, and truly made the world a better place.
My deepest condolences to his family, friends and coworkers. The tech industry will never be the same. I will miss his vision.
Steve,  Though you left us, your spirit can still be found in everybody's hands. Man, you did change our life!  *Rest In Peace.*&nbsp;
Steve, as we mourning your way home today, we will remember you in our heart forever.   And tomorrow we will celebrate life as you would have wanted.  So thank you Steve, thank you for making our mundane everyday life much better.  We love you always.
To Steve Jobs, my biggest role model.  Steve was an amazing man.  A college dropout, a nerd, an outcast.  He  changed the world and everyone's lives.  If Steve never made the first  Mac, things would have been terribly different in the world today. I'm a  teenager, and as I grew up, my father would always talk about  Steve Jobs and Apple.  Everyday, it was something new, so Steve seemed  like part of the family in a way. My parents are away right now, and when I got home from school they  called and told me he had passed away earlier today.  I cried so much,  just as if he were a real family member of mine who had just died. Steve will never be forgotten, never.  He will go down in history, and  be remembered as such a significant being.
Steve Jobs,  Thank you for all you have done and contributed to this new generation of technology. You have inspired hundreds of thousands by doing simply what you love.  You will always be remembered. 
Jobs was the smartest man in this world, he uses his talent to make our  life better. At the end of his life, he still didn't forget to make our  life better. I proud for him. 
You will always remain as one of my brightest models. Thank you  
Dear Steve  You encourage me to change my life.  I miss you so much.  I'll never forget the words that you gave me  "Stay hungry. Stay   foolish."  Rest in peace.
I feel so sad for his family and friends.  He put up a good fight and never quit, on his health, his passion.   
Hi,  My deepest condolence to Steve Jobs's Family.  Im from Malaysia a graphic designer, I started to use Mac Desktop   since 1995 while im still a student in an art college, I still   remember im one of the few rare species who are using Mac in the   market, machine are very expensive difficult to get parts or external   compatible stuff and most of the peoples here don't know what is Mac   only advertising company did.  Now thanks to Steve Jobs created a lots of greatest Apple stuffs to   the world and now Im like sharing a same language with everyone and   everywhere yet we lost a creative genius.  Best Regards,&nbsp;
I have been using Apple since 1984!  An invention that has changed the very way we live daily! Without Steve and his creativity we would still be typing in dos and using tin cans with string.  My condolences to Mrs. Jobs and family.&nbsp;
RIP Steve Jobs, you have moved and transformed one of the largest markets in the world.     True Legend for many generations to come.     I wish I was at home typing this up on my iMac as a tribute.     Thoughts and prayers are with your family.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,   I have never had a chance to meet you in person as I would like to personally thank you for your vision to change this world into an exciting digital age.   As a digital migrant, you have help me migrate into the digital age in such simplistic tools with the great inventions that you and Apple had brought to the human race and set the stage for the future generations as digital citizens!  I will always remember you as the father of mobility, visionary , innovator of all time and the catalyst that changed our life into this exciting and beautiful digital age!  Rest in Peace Steve!
Steve Jobs may have left us but his works, his insight to the world around and knowing how he has used his time on earth will be remembered.  He has shown those around the meaning of determination, courage when things seem impossible, when many would have given up without a fight. His struggle against his illness has given hope to many. His passion for the work he loves never left him. How he embrace life will be a model for the many afflicted with similar suffering.  Now, Steve Jobs will always be remembered as a man soldiering on in the face of adversity, a brilliant mind, a man ahead of his time, an entrepreneur with a foresight much further than the rest.&nbsp;
Steve,  Thanks for your passion. I am, and have been, inspired by your efforts, achievements and passion for life.  I strive for insanely great.  Thank you.&nbsp;
I would like to say thank you to Steve because he has made the lives   of so many people so much better!  I am sending this email on my Mac   Book Pro while reading a book on my iPad and listening to music on my   iPod.  Thank you for what you have done for this world and we will   never forget you!  Tegwyth  P.S. I am 16 and instead of a car for my 16th birthday, I wanted an   iPad 2!   So thank you for making my sweet 16 birthday present! 
I have never used any of your products but I do know the revelation that you have brought into this industry and it is mainly because of Steve Jobs. If it was not for him things would have been so different and boring. Steve Jobs will be always be remembered as a revolutionary visionary leader and a great creative thinker, who had made a unique transformation in the field of information communications technology.      With sympathies and condolences to Apple and Steve's family.
 I feel the death of my biggest idol, he was to me a kind of example for all mankind hope and perseverance, nothing in the world is going to cause as much impact as this genius did, I have never known before, and never know now. While I'm with my goal of creating a large technology company, my memories of his lectures will be in my mind forever. Rest in Peace, Master.&nbsp;
May the Lord bless his family in this difficult time. I personally want encourage the apple family to carry on his vision because it has changed the way technology is seen and sets an example to many not settle for just good enough...seeking excellence always and in everything.
The world truly lost a GREAT person today. RIP &nbsp;
 hi man,     i'm using ipad2 to write this letter,and i hope you will read it.     i think to write something for you,but i have no idea.     my name is xiaobing lau,from beijing.i like you,and i think you are the real man ,i'll be you fans forever.  good luck ! 
The way Steve Jobs revolutionized technology will never be forgotten. The innovations he made at Apple were truly incredible. Apple has changed our ever y day lives incredibly and none of this would be possible without Steve. I can remember my amazement when I first saw the original iPhone and I find it amazing that I'm writing this email on an iPhone 4.<div>R.I.P. Steve. The changes you made in the world of technology will live on forever.  My condolences.</div>
Steve taught us all to dream, and realize that our dreams could become real.  I'm a technology entrepreneur, and for as long as I can remember, Steve was a role model.  Even when I didn't like his products, I admired his determination and genius.  Steve Jobs: entrepreneur, visionary, creator, giant-killer.  At a time when the world needs so many more people like you--you'll be missed. &nbsp;
 Thank you Steve Jobs for all he did and for helping make technology what it is today and what is to come in the future. My family sends our prayers to Steve Jobs and his family.&nbsp;
Thanks you, Steve, for light which you have brought!&nbsp;
The world has lost a great man.  I feel fortunate to have lived during his time.  My condolences to all of his family including all of his dedicated employees.&nbsp;
Steve has been an inspiration for me since I was 12. So about 5 years. He wa s a great person and he will be dearly missed. I'm very upset :(
Thanks Steve for changing the world.. I don't know what I would do without my iPhone, iMac, Macbook &amp; iPad..&nbsp;
i'm just proud of steve.  love,  someone who never knew him.  love,  someone who appreciates him. 
  PLEASE ACCEPT MY DEEPEST SYMPATHY.  I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER HIM IN MY PRAYER.  "Stay hungry stay foolish"&nbsp;
Thank you for leaving mankind your legacy. We will always remember you.&nbsp;
Rest in Peace Steve Jobs. Without you, our world would have been totally different. You have most  definitely made a mark on this earth and it will never be forgotten.  Thank you for all you did for the world. You changed our lives.
I give my condolences to the great genius of Apple. True, I didn't like  the approach of how Apple did business (mostly software-wise), Steve  Jobs was an absolute genius. He came up with the very first popular  Graphical User Interface, and from there, has led a huge success for  Apple. I, personally, am against the business practices of both  Microsoft and Apple, but this man was a genius. A true innovator. A  great man, whom actually inspired me in many ways. Farewell, good sir.  Maybe he'll run Apple in whichever ethereal realm he is in. Who knows,  he might make Heaven more enjoyable! 
Remember you  forever!!!                    Have a safe trip home!
My condolences to his family and everyone who mourns him tonight. Steve has inspired me to become more than what I am, to keep reaching for greatness and excellence, and to never stop working to make people's lives better. 
Steve was my hero. plain and simple. He inspired me in so many ways i  cant even begin to count. he was a true visionary and business man that  always worked towards something until it was perfect. Those who worked  with Mr. Jobs should feel honored and privileged to work with and for  such a talented innovative person who changed the world and lives of  many. My dream in life was to one day meet and work for Mr. Jobs. i have  and will always hope to be exactly like him, turtle neck and all. i send  out my condolences to his family and friends. I cant begin to imagine  how hard this must be for them because i myself started to choke up a  bit when i heard the news. Steve and I both started with technology at a  young age, i was about 5 and now 15 and have come a long way and i have  always tried to follow the footsteps of Steve. I have always looked  forward to getting home from school watching his keynotes for apples new  devices and products, but most of all i looked forward to seeing Mr.  Jobs present it. He did it in a way that no one else could, he's truly  unique in my eye and i'm sure in many others. Steve will always be loved  and missed and never forgotten. Rest In Peace Steve. 
 Dear Apple Inc. - My condolences to all of Steve's immediate family  and the Apple Inc. of his recent demise.... You must say you actually did not lose him, the gem of a man, because his legacy will remain forever in our heart and soul... 'Do not just remember how he died but remember how he lived.....'  Rest In Peace, Steve Jobs.
I think it says a lot about the man as the way the world has reacted.  The man will  always be the spiritual head of the company. 
R.I.P Steve Thank you for your great innovation.&nbsp;
Dear Apple and Steve's family,  Mr Jobs was an inspiration to me, and his company's products and the amazing  team he built have given my life great joy, and my career fresh legs.  This is a great loss for our industry, our country, and the world. His impact will be felt for generations, and his example will be cherished. My sincerest condolences.
Thank you Steve, for making our lives exciting, wondrous, and inter-connected. You taught us all to think different. "The best of men cannot suspend their fate, the good die early and the bad die late." -Daniel Defoe 
You have left so much for us, the future generations. Born in 1994, before you have made your dramatic comeback to Apple, I am glad my life has had the chance to experience the essence of your genius through your amazing products. I remember acting as you on our annual "Night of the notables", as your charisma truly inspired me. Without you, there would have been no way that I would have grown a love for computers and technology. You are a great man, Steve. You will always be my inspiration. Please do rest in peace.
Aloha: I never met Steve but I feel like I lost a family member.  Great inspiration, and great Man! Prayers for his family.
This is an insanely sad day...  and too soon for all of us.&nbsp;
Steve, teaching us to think different. Thank you.
The world has lost a great man and I have lost an inspiration and hero.  Rest in peace Steve, and my sincerest regards to his family. Live on Apple, continue to inspire myself and the masses.
MY HEART GOES OUT TO JOBS FAMILY! 
I never met steve, never got a chance to talk to him and I doubt he would have known my name or even that I existed. However, his story was something I would always dream of, he has lived things that we vaguely imagine and I have to say that  much of the ideas and the technology I use was based on his ideas, on his vision and the team that worked with him. Inspiration is the key word I would take to try to make things happen in my life, and his story provides that and makes me want to try over and over, no matter if I fail, I will try again until the end. Thanks for (in)directly affect the way I do things in my life
Rest in peace, Steve.&nbsp;I don't own a single Apple product but I can appreciate what you have done, for Apple, for your customers and for everyone involved in IT.Steve, you truly were a titan of computing and a once-in-a-century entrepreneur.&nbsp;My sincere condolences&nbsp;to all your family, friends and co-workers.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs, you were the best, you totally change ours world's technology culture. You will be deeply missed&nbsp;
Today's loss is a marked one.  Steve brilliantly pioneered the  integration of human instinct into consumer technology.  He relentlessly  pushed Apple to raise the bar for user expectations and dared the  competition to keep pace.  His vision and impact will undoubtedly be  realized for generations to come.  So thank you Steve for your every day  presence in my tech-life.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a man that lived for his customers. For a long time, he was creating many items for us to enjoy. I personally thought, what a man he was. Being able to make something better than what is already perfect. I loved his work, and enjoyed using it. I really think no person can make something as great as he did. I feel great sorrow that one of the greatest inventors had died. Everyone will truly miss him, and respect him.&nbsp;
Not only has Apple lost an incredible man, but the world has too....The world will not be the same and Steve has had great technological success in making it what it is today. Mr. Jobs is one person that I would've loved to have known... smart, intellectual, down to earth and an amazing person gone much too soon. My deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Steve Jobs.... one who will never be forgotten!!! To Steve's children - I am so so sorry for your loss!  I know it hurts (I lost my stepdad, who was my only father figure) in 2007 to complications from a stroke, at the age of 50.  Time will help heal but know you dad will always be with you no matter what ;)   He leaves you a phenomenal legacy! To Steve's wife Laurene - I'm so very sorry for the loss of your beloved husband.  What a special and notable man he was and always will be!  Keep your head up and stay strong.  He will always be there with you and for you, even when you least expect it ;) God Bless you all! RIP Steve.....&nbsp;
Thank you Steve, for sharing the gift of your creativity, innovation,  and most all of changing our lives for the better. Your inspiration and  creativity will be passed on and appreciated by many generations to  come. Also, thank you for the life lessons you shared with us all, the  lessons of never giving up, believing in one's self and holding on to  your dreams.
There are a number of people that made a difference. Steve is one of those. Thank you Steve for having the courage to be yourself and thank you all at Apple for allowing him to. Take the reins and drive that galloping horse to a continuing great future. This industry has shaped a generation. Several actually. I remember my mom said, Apple has the best ads, genius. She was right.
I may not have met you Steve but you have changed the way I think about things.  Thank you for being an inspiration. My heart goes out to your family at this time of challenge. Rest in peace, Steve.  All is well.... 
As a graphic designer, I feel I owe my career to Steve Jobs. Digital graphic design would not be where it is today without Steve, and his innovative concepts will continue to shape the future of this industry for many years to come. Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
I just wanted to share my condolences with Steve's family and the Apple  team. Steve - and Apple - have certainly made the world a better place.  He was a brave pioneer and innovator, and proof that one person can make  a big difference. We will miss him. May God be with his family and his team at this time  of such sorrow. Steve, rest in peace.
I'm Korean. I am terrible use of English.    However, in order to mourn his death, writes a letter.   The great achievement is that he left. So, even sad.   Holding up his empty seat, but still going to believe that Apple.   My warmest tribute to the memory of the deceased.  
you impacted the lives of each person who ever clicked a mouse, watched a Pixar film, or listened to music. we'll miss you Steve, the world was lucky to have you. 
Rest in peace Steve Jobs. Great are your works.&nbsp;
Rest in Peace.&nbsp;
I am among the many saddened by the news of Steve's passing. He's become an inspiration to me, reminds me to dream and pursue those dreams. His creativity and genius, his many accomplishments will continue to be appreciated. My most sincere sympathies and prayers to Steve's family. "... you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future." - Steve Jobs 
Thanks for the memories. &nbsp;And for the Apples, Macs, Pods, Pads, and Phones you gave us to manage them.&nbsp;
When I heard the news today, I was brought to tears. I saw Mr. Jobs as a man with such drive, and creative genius. I also saw him as a role model, to me to keep thinking outside of the box, and never settle for less. In remembrance, I give you my favorite quote:  "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?"  In my eyes, he is the Twenty-First Century Thomas Edison, and he will always be remembered.  
Steve Jobs introduced me to computing that made sense. Visual, intuitive, invisible, alive --  the machine he invented and I first experienced in 1986 transformed the clumsy, intrusive PC into tool as fluid as pen or paintbrush, as open and challenging as a blank page. And that, as we all know, was just for starters.  His genius made my career possible, and enhanced my life year after year, Mac after Mac.  I'm forever indebted and terribly saddened. I hope it gives comfort to his family, colleagues and others who knew him personally that so many of us, tapping Apple keyboards or screens or pads tonight, feel their loss.  His life, and what he clearly loved and made happen in the world, touched me to the core.&nbsp;
I honestly don't know what to say. &nbsp;I have never met Mr. Jobs but have had a great experience with all of his products. &nbsp;I feel like I've lost my best friend. &nbsp;I marveled at him whenever he would introduce new software or hardware. &nbsp;He was indeed a complete genius and he will be greatly missed. &nbsp;Long Live Steve, Long Live Apple.&nbsp;
I am from Puerto Rico and when i saw the news on the internet a couple  of minutes ago couldn't believe it, i am very sorry for your lost Apple  inc and as well for the family of Mr.Jobs. i ' am just a kid, 18 years  old and i consider Steve Jobs a role mode of my life. saying that i hope  i can be a man of vision like he was and inspiration to other people  like Steve was for me and still is. My condolences. and for the family i  want you to remember that no one truelly loses someone who dies, as long  that he remains in your hearts just close your eyes and you'll see him  again. God bless you all.&nbsp;
 I am so sad to learn about the loss of Steve. Although most of us did not have the pleasure of meeting and working with him, he was our friend who took us to places we could never imagine through a beautiful technological journey  of imagination and achievement. From my first Mac to my latest iPad, I marvel at Steve's marvelous mind. Thank you Steve! Your work and vision will be the bedrock of many innovations to come. Sent from my iPad&nbsp;
I was blessed enough to be Steve's tour guide on his family visit to the Walt Disney World Resort. Steve and his family were more gracious than I could have ever expected. Steve was very smart and had high expectations and I appreciated his attention to detail. He was a one of a kind guy and my heart goes to his family, who can be very proud of the legacy their father and husband left behind. The world has lost an innovator and a perfectionist in quality. We all grieve for this man who truly gave us the idea of what the future can be.&nbsp;
I've been a huge fan of apple for 5 years. I'm from China. And I'm really sorry for the great loss. I admire Steve a lot. And really thank u Steve for all the iProducts.
Hello,  I am a student never purchased an iPhone or iPad. But I still thank Steve bring these amazing electronic products to us.  Because he gave me a goal, a desire to own an iPhone. That make iPhone a  part of my life.  Steve, you will never die.
Thank you so much for making this world a better place. You've made everyone think different.
Thank you for bringing so much innovation to the world. You'll be missed.&nbsp;
I have only just read the news and this moment learn that Steve and I shared the same birthday. He will be in my prayers.  Steve has been a business mentor  from  my early years in college. At 50 going on 51 I am taking the quantum leap into a new career with plans to establish my own company. What can I say? I am sad by the loss but motivated by his victorious life experience. Condolences to the family and company.&nbsp;
With great sadness; for now just a "thank you" &nbsp;
Thank you for sharing your talent. RIP, Sir.
People like Steve Jobs come along once every 500 years.  The world has suffered a great loss. &nbsp;
Rest in peace Mr. Jobs. Your name has, and will be up amongst the greatest of our time here on Earth. 
He was indeed a visionary and the light in our world is a little dimmer.   My heart goes out to his family. 
 Great people never fail to convey their great joy to life. Thanks for sharing your joy and excitement to people.            
Thanks to you Steve and your vision about life I've been able to succeed where I am. I will miss you. A genius just left this earth.
steve jobs has been such an inspiration, i wish i could have meet him 
My sister just texted me and mentioned the Steve Jobs has died.  I told her I  know.  I am in mourning.  Mr. Jobs is the "Leonardo da Vinci" of our times.   I once heard Howard Stern said that the government must spend all of it's energy to keep him alive (in jest of course), but he is right, "we lost a visionary and genius".  Farewell, Mr. Jobs.
I am so sad I am crying. For real. <br>
Steve, you died a visionary and changed the world in the process.. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
Wow, I was shocked when i read that Steve jobs passed away :'(. Steve jobs had amazing inventions that only his mind could think of. If only I could have met you in person before this happened. Thank you for all you have done for your apple fans. You will be missed and it is now time for you to rest.&nbsp;
It truly is difficult to think of one single person who has changed not just  the world, but my world, so much. You truly were, and still are, a force to  behold.  Rest in Peace Steve.
 I feel as though my best friend has died.   All our lives have changed because of him. The most fundamental aspects of our lives will never be the same. We communicate far, far better, we think more clearly, we use our time more effectively, we have greater access to our memories, music, art, books, and most of the things we value. The things Steve has created, caused to be created, and helped to be created were all created in a way that most people could understand them and use them easily. This means that the lives of almost all people are changed now but, also, will evolve for the better for eternity.  In spite of our grief we can all be grateful for the drastic improvement of civilization that Steve has wrought. He created a team at Apple that will keep things moving in the right direction. I trust Steve may be amongst us again, changing the world further.
You've changed all of us for the better.  Thanks 
Thanks Mr. Jobs, you did a lot for every single person involved in the world of technology.
Dear Apple and Jobs' family,  I love Apple and was always surprised by Apple products. I wish this legend could continue.&nbsp;
What a genius.  Steve we will miss you.  Thank you for making all of our lives easier.  Our thoughts and prayers to your family, friends and colleagues. 
It is with very deep sadness that I've learned of the passing of Steve  Jobs.  My heart goes out to his family, as they grieve the loss of their loved  one, a man we all loved and admired for so long.  There are no words to express the sadness I feel in seeing this creative  genius and genuinely good person, he left us much to soon.  Rest in Peace Steve, you will be remembered and honored forever.&nbsp;
 I have built a career in computer technology because of his vision and inno vation. Rest in peace. Your family is in our prayers.
 Thank you sir for making lives simpler and easier. Thanks for enriching our lives with those wonderful products and movies (Pixar). You made computers/mobile entertainment fun again.  Hopefully your family and Apple will find the strength to move on and continue to do great things.  I have never met Mr Jobs, but you sir are the best in the craft and irreplaceable . May your soul find peace.
Steve,  You've been a real inspiration to me... I love the philosophy, the  design, the energy you've put into every product you have released at  Apple! Each and every Apple product appears to be a part of you... And  we in turn have been touched by you too...Thank you for coming to this world and making it a better place!  - <br>
My best wishes to Steve´s family. A terrible news and a sad day for the  industry he helped to create.&nbsp;
You will receive many emails telling you how Steve Jobs was an  inspiration to so many.  I cannot argue with that.  But it is the  completeness of Steve's brilliance that always engaged me.  He dropped  out of college because he was too big for it, or too bored with it.  I  parallel that.  He drove innovation and saw possibilities in  technologies that everyone else was unaware even existed - another  parallel.  He evolved the entire computing industry in to what it is  today.  Without Steve, who knows where we would be with our personal  computing capabilities.  Steve is more than the Leonardo Da Vinci of our  time.  He not only envisioned new directions; he made them come to life,  in ways that nobody could match.  He was willing to take risks, accepted  his failures, and moved on.  I grew up with personal and desktop computers along the same timeline as  they were invented so I know that although there are many brilliant  people out there, there will never be another Steve Jobs.  I hope that his passing and his life are celebrated in a line of Apple  products that we can all buy - it would be fitting to acquire some small  memory of today's sad news.  I wish Apple all the luck and success it deserves. I am a very loyal Mac  user and continue to spread the word.  Best wishes&nbsp;
I always had a passion for technology but I was in a PC world. After I was introduced to iPod and iPhone I began to seek out Steve and his passion. I became an Apple and Steve news junkie. Today I share my passion for Apple and technology to others just as Steve once did. I thank him for showing the world a new direction to be able enjoy life and make each life a little better. I am thankful for all he did and I take a little piece of him with me everyday. Thank you Steve. &nbsp;
The world has lost a great visionary.  Although, I never knew him..... his work will be known and savored for many many years.   My sympathy for all that knew and worked with him.
You will forever be my hero!
We will probably not see another innovator and creative thinker like Steve Jobs again in our lifetime. Condolences to his family.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,<div><br></div><div>No one has ever technologically rocked my world the way you have. I have no words as to how sad i am right now. I wish you'd come back.</div>
Thank you Steve, for everything you've contributed to the world.&nbsp;
My heart goes out to all that knew Steve, and to all those who know of him because they have a mac, an ipod, an ipad, etc.  I will think of Steve whenever I am using one of my various apple products.  The geek in me is heartbroken.  I pray he was able to spend a great deal of quality time with his family and friends and that he felt the love of everyone whose lives he touched.  RIP Steve. &nbsp;
You changed the world and changed my life.  Thank you Steve.   Rest in peace. 
The world lost a revolutionary man today. He will be missed. RIP Steve Jobs,  and our thoughts and prayers go out his family.
Steve Jobs will still be an inspiration to me. Through what he has done throughout his life, he has inspired me to not just be the best I can be but to be more then the best. He will never be forgotten or missed and I wish his family the best. 
Steve, I'll always remember walking into your stores being in complete  amazement of what I saw. It was always like being a little kid in a  candy store with all the technology to experience first hand. You were an inspiration to us all.  Thank you for the lessons in innovation.
&nbsp;I'm really sorry to hear that he is past away   Always I remember his innovation, history, life and all of his.   I pray for the repose of the soul of Steve.   I wish, I believe Apple is better than before.   Thank you. 
Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs. Our prayers go out to you and everyone who has been affected by you, directly or indirectly.
We are sad to hear of Steve's passing. Please convey our condolences to his family, friends and employees.  Our deepest sympathy, from my family
I've let my life come to a stand still for a moment to honor and appreciate a man that i feel so deeply touched by.  His products. His genius. His vision. His foresight. His creativity. His wisdom. All abound so obviously - in every one of the Apple items in my life. And all the success they allow me to create.  Sending condolences to the entire Jobs Family. Both his immediate and his professional.  As Mr jobs passes on from this world to the next, at least we can take some solace in knowing that he will change the next world too. Imagine the technology that awaits us all upon our arrival there. Someday.  With love and heartfelt sympathy to all.  Sincerely,     Craig Apple G3 Apple G4 Apple G5 (x two) Mac Mini Mac pro MacBook Iphone 3G x (two) Ipod Classic Ipod touch (x three) Ipad 2 iMac  And whatever comes next...  
If any I could say, I'd like to say thank you to Steve for his great inspiration and his life as the role model to many of us in this world.     Thank you Steve.&nbsp;
...a man who changed the view how we see (and work with) the personal computer, with Apple as a reference, continuously raising the bar for exciting innovations...     ... Steve Jobs, thank you for everything, we will miss you ...&nbsp;
A hero of mine has gone home. RIP Steve Jobs. Your passion and  brilliance will be greatly missed. Apple, please continue Steve's visions and innovations. 
Thank you Steve Jobs, for everything. All the computers, ipods, iphones, ipads, but not just those. &nbsp;Also, the memories, the inspirations, the constant checking of apple.com to see if the iphone 5 had come out, the EVERYTHING. Steve jobs will always be remembered.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was an amazing person who definitely lived a fulfilling life.  Thank you for providing us with amazing Apple products and being an inspiration for many.  Rest in peace.
 I never knew Steve personally, yet always had the utmost respect for him. My thoughts and prayers go to his family and associates. The world was blessed to have such a wonderful individual, who influenced all of us by bring the future of technology to us every day.&nbsp;
When I was about 13 my addiction to Apple began, I've had iPods, iPads,  iPhones, iTouches, and a MacBook Pro and I still act like a 5 year old  at Disneyland every time I walk into an Apple store. Every Apple user,  now and forever will know Steve Jobs though the magnificent expanse of  Apples achievements. He gave the world things we didn't even know we  wanted. He made nerds cool and made the cool kids want to be nerds. He  made every Apple user feel like we were part of something BIG and he  showed us how important it was that things "JUST WORK". Steve, like a  father you demanded we get the best, you made sure that the products and  services we got lived up to the hype and for that, we your loyal  customers will remember you forever. You memory will live on in the  hands of billions across the world now and for years to come.
Thank you for what you have bring to the world. Your spirit will encourage me forever. God bless you, Steve. God bless Apple. I will always keep in mind what you have said ‘ Stay hungry, Stay foolish.’
Dear Steve,  Today, as I was on my way to the Apple Store, and to meetings I had in the city, I listened to the audiobook by Carmine Gallo, The Innovation Secrets of Steve Jobs. Tonight, at around 10PM, the same way it has been for about a year since I started the business venture I was dreaming of all my life, I will see you when I'll regroup around the table my imaginary board members for the day's meeting. You have always been at the exact opposite side of me on that table and you will continue to be. Some of the most amazing minds of the past 200 years are at that table, and you have always been one of them. You have been such an amazing inspiration for me.  Thank you, Steve! You are, and will always be a fantastic mentor.&nbsp;
There aren't words to express my appreciation for the legacy Mr. Jobs leaves behind in the special needs community.  My son, my family, and millions of others around the world are and will continue to be better off because of the innovations he dreamed and saw accomplished that help our loved ones to communicate and lead more comfortable lives.  My condolences to his family and colleagues.&nbsp;
I never idolized a person, but an idea. People very often tend to set  you back, but ideas no matter how bad they are, they keep you moving  forward. Today we lost a realist that was driven forward by idealism.  Even though the very essence of the philosophies are contradictory to  each other, he personified them both, just like an idea. An idea that  reminds you, no matter how bleak the future is, it is your  responsibility to change that future for the better. When the future  becomes the present, and "clears out the old to make way for the new",  we are going to be driven forward by the same idea. The idea that is  Steve Jobs...  Rest in Peace 
He changed the world. Apple, Next, and Pixar, are just a few of the ways he placed his indelible print on this world. He was a visionary that excelled in execution. He brought the future to our doorstep time after time.  Thank you Steve Jobs.  May you rest in peace.  Thoughts and prayers to your immediate and extended family. 
As I sit at my iMac with my iPhone nearby and my battered but well-loved  iPods just over there, I realize that Steve Jobs's fantastic vision has  influenced my life in more ways than I understand. Perhaps the most  important influence though, has not come directly from the hardware or  the software, but comes from the recognition that there is a better way,  even when nobody seems to think so. I only wish I could have thanked the  man himself for all he has contributed to my life. <br>
To The Family and Friends of Steve Jobs;  To Those in of memories sought, dwells a founding star now being born through the visions now shining forth..... There is a memory who shall dwell within my heart through the integrity lived.  Steve Jobs the earthly name given shall shine above.     
Steve Jobs helped me and a large portion of the world see so much more clearly with his vision. My life would never have as full without his Macs and itunes store. My career wouldn't be where it is without Final Cut. My warmest wishes to his family and friends.
Thank you, Steve. I love Apple.
An amazing person who created amazing products. He lives on through the  genius of his creations.&nbsp;
Thanks for being the leader of the home computing revolution and  accepting no less than the best from yourself and those around you. The  world is a better place because of you. RIP Steve Jobs, you will be  missed.  
Steve was one the greatest inventor in computer history. He has   change  the world and  life for the best to all mankind. God bless   Steve Job!!!!! Apple and Steve live for   ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
The world of technology has lost an absolute masterpiece of a genius. A man that is truly the definition of forward-thinking. His ambition, his passion for success and the human heart will forever be missed. A man that taught us that the only way a product could become successful is to merge technology and the liberal arts. Where the immersion of technology becomes magical and truly enriches lives. This day will forever be remembered as the day technology stood still and watched it's leader leave us. Leaves us a legacy to build upon, a vision to continually pursue and give others the opportunity to be great. I believe in his vision. I believe in his spirit. I believe in Apple.  We'll miss you Steve. You'll forever be remembered.
From what i know Steve Jobs was an amazing man and deserves nothing less than the honor of any great inventor. He has made many great inventions in which I use on a daily basis. One of the most widely known products in all of the world, the I-Phone and has brought pride back to products invented by American Citizens. Starting from nothing and making an empire. Steve Jobs will not only be missed by all users of his products and his co-workers and family. I will miss hearing his name in the news for all his products that he produces and the good things he has done. You will be missed Steve. May you rest in peace. 
We are proud Apple MacBook Pro owners.   Steve Jobs and his brilliance  made a difference for many others including us.  We would like to send  our sincere condolences to the Jobs Family for the loss of their beloved  and irreplaceable family member.  Our thoughts our also with the Apple  "Family members" as they  mourn the loss of their admired founder  as  well.  He absolutely made our modern-day world a better place as he  graced us with his genius.&nbsp;
Did my ten year-old self ask my mom to paint my room Bondi Blue when the first iMac came out? Sure did. That's how much I was in love with Apple, even during the Steve-less years when I spent hours breaking and fixing a Performa 577. The company has been a fixture in my life for almost 20 years, and Steve has been at the forefront of the most exciting moments during those two decades.  My heart goes out to Steve's family and his extended family at Apple. He will be missed.
I think, my first using a Mac is 1997. I was very surprised its interface better than PC. In 1998, when I saw the iMac I was attached its beautiful design. Steve was an icon and very powerful inspiration for me. I have been happy with his creative items such as iPod. Thank you, Steve. I appreciate to live at the same time with you. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
I am so sorry for your loss.  The world has lost the true creator of  ingenuity through ideation.  Today October 5, 2011 is "The Day The Genius Died"  Sincerely
In loving memory from Rome: today I run with iPhone on my arms for 6 km, I write an email to my loving girlfriend with a macbook, I prepare to work to a film with Final Cut, I found a street with iphone. That's all, all about a Steve Jobs idea. Make a better world, simple. Thank U Mr. Jobs. 
Thank you Steve for persevering to create amazing products, superior customer experience &amp; raising the bar for the industry. You have been an inspiration &amp; will be missed.&nbsp;
 For Steve, his team, and his family, I was born in March 1980 and grew up with Apple.  I learned Logo on an Apple IIe at elementary school, where my teacher promised us we would one day carry around computers the size of our lunch boxes.  I played Oregon Trail obsessively on a Apple IIc at home, the first computer my family owned.  When my parents bought a Macintosh, my brother and I fought over MacPaint and stared at pre-loaded clip art of JFK, curious as to his identity--how was he so important that his face was just ON our computer?  When I went to college in the fall of 1998, I took the very first iMac with me (it's still in my closet).  I saved up at my retail job, desperate for the original iPod that changed the way people listen to music.  My beaten and scratched second-generation Nano still works, and I can't seem to part with it.  I was loyal, even through infamous iBook G3 and G4 logic board failures, and I cruise the internet on my MacBook Pro every night.  I'm writing this from my mother's (much newer) iMac to say thank you, Steve.  We are an Apple family.  Apple is inspiration and innovation made tangible and accessible.  You continually reminded us the impossible's actually just around the bend, and the sky was never the limit.   Thank you.            
I'm very sorry to see such a great person leave us.  His vision and passion has changed the world of technology as we know it. You will be missed by many, however I'm confident the people who will carry on in your name will treat such a wonderful company as you did.  They have some big shoes to fill...
Thank you Steve by your important contribution with the World. You presented-us the best examples how think different! Good rest with God!&nbsp;
Steve You always amazed me and the whole world. I was obsessed by your all creations from the age of 14 (Now i m 22!) I miss you and your black old sweater and 993 trainers haha. Rest in peace&nbsp;
Like an artist whom one listens to for your many years, but you only  know via their recordings, I feel as if I lost a friend.  Like an actor  who you come to know from their work, but never actually befriend, I  feel I got to know Steve.  But unlike any poet or political figure,  Steve was the only business leader whom I not only touched his products  everyday for the last 25 years of my life, but embodied many of the  traits I aspire as a unique leader.  I connected with him daily, even  though he never knew me.  His effect was profound on me personally and  our society at large.  When you saw a person in a cafe on a MacBook, you  were on the same team, unlike those PC folk.  That is profound influence  and one that is without comparison in my 50 years of life.  Of course, 7  years younger, I now am freaking out about how life is too short and  fragile.  Need to live it to the fullest, the best and productive.  He  was an inspiration and will be missed.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve for everything you have done in Apple Thank you for the passion and ideas you had and for all your hard work. We lost a genius who made himself and changed the world with his ideas. we will always miss you. 
The world has lost a creative genius, the likes of whom we may never see again.
Steve Jobs brought us into the 21st Century. For that, we thank him.&nbsp;
Few men can say they had an impact on history the way Steve did  
I've always wanted to tell you how you changed my life. Your vision inspired me. Your products are the tools of my trade. I have lost my mentor. Rest in peace Steve.
IT IS WITH GREAT SADNESS THAT WE MOURN THE LOSS OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST  INNOVATOR.  SOME HOW WE ALL KNOW HIM THROUGH HIS PRODUCTS ALTHOUGH NOT  PERSONALLY. NOT A DAY GOES BY THAT HE ISN'T A PART OF MANY OF OUR LIVES.   CONDOLENCES TO HIS FAMILY AND TO ALL THAT RESPECTED HIM FROM A FAR.  THE  WORLD WILL MISS HIM. 
 Steve Jobs was an amazing person. I have loved all  of his work.  He had many great ideas that he strived to make a reality. My name is  Mike Price and I love my iPods and my MacBook. I wanna get the new  iPhone 4S too. Hopefully I can. Hopefully even with Steve Jobs passed  on, Apple continues to make people say "wow!" with their new inventions  and devices. I am an Apple fan and will continue to be one. When I get  money i will buy a MacBook Pro, I got my MacBook from a friend and its  from 2006. I wish I had money for a new one, but it works. Thats what I  love above Apple and Steve Jobs, their devices work years after they  have been out. I can not believe Steve passed away today :(  I hope his amazing work will continue with everyone at Apple. I  know in this hard time they can make the best of things. I don't even  know what to say. I just feel so bad. I hope Steve's family can make it  through this. Rest in peace Steve Jobs, u will be missed by everyone.  You inspired so many people. And nerds all around the world just like me  will ALWAYS look up to you. You are one of my heroes. I want to be just  like you. I want to own my own computer business and make it far in  life. I love Apple, and I loved Steve Jobs. Goodbye Steve, we all miss  you.&nbsp;
I am remember you 
Sad sad day!!!  In today's world where wars, economic hardship and  disasters are abound and aplenty, Steve Jobs and Apple reminds us that  we are in fact in the 21st century and there is beauty, creativity and  imagination in the world... His legacy will surely live eternally... Condolences to his family and friends and Apple and family...
You were an incredibly creative genius, a very gifted human being...thank you Mr. Jobs for sharing your gift with the world.   May you forever rest peacefully, you will be missed...&nbsp;
To Mr. Jobs family, staff and friends,     We are sad to hear of his passing. Steve, to us, major fans of the apple/macs, has brought such creative genius to our generation and we are forever thankful! May he rest in peace in God's graces. Thank you.&nbsp;
We have lost a great man&nbsp;
Dear Steve Jobs,      You have helped me succeed both economically and academically - thanks to your brilliance and innovation. I remember buying the Second Generation iPod and thinking that it was the greatest invention ever, and yet you still managed to continuously surprise me with a new vision periodically after that. Because of you, I have a 3.63 GPA and expect to go to Medical School next year. I am forever indebted to you and your ideas. You will surely be missed. May you rest in peace. 
I would like to take a moment to honor Steve's accomplishments by  stating that I've reached a feeling of satisfaction by being blessed to  own several Apple products, which I will now hold dearly as a reminder  of the great innovation and standards which followed him as he  progressed technologically throughout his career at Apple. May he  peacefully rest in God's hands. 
.........First of all: Even in my own language I can not find the right words. I am sorry and want to offer my condolences to Steve Jobs family and  friends. I did not know him, not the man behind his role in business, he was one of  the richest and most famous people and myself, who has not achieved anything yet, I am sitting here, above my keybord, sobbing and searching for words , to express what I feel... I love what he has achieved in his life. He gave us so many wonderful things. He has made the world a bit gracious, every time he donates us a new vision...and I miss him - I hope it doesn't sound unfitting, but I really do ...that is the way I feel Thank you Steve for beeing such a visionary...thank you for beeing among us ...thank you In deepest grief&nbsp;
Our deepest condolences go out to Steve Jobs family. He was a wonderful mentor and will never be forgotten. He will be remembered always in our hearts and in our prayers.&nbsp;
We lost one of the greatest people that ever lived. I hope that he is  happy wherever he is now, and you guys keep up the good work like he  would like to do it. R.I.P Steve, I will always remember you... 
i was lucky enough to see Steve speak at several 'MacWorld'   conferences in the late nineties. Everything was changing so quickly   at that point... I'll never forget Steve showing the first "wireless"   laptops by passing them through a hoolahoop like a magic show. You   could have heard a pin drop when Steve was on stage. He was an amazing   speaker and a true visionary.  He was an inspiration to multiple generations and will be sorely missed.&nbsp;
After some friendly suggestions, last year I made the conversion from PC to Mac. Permanently.   I've loved Apple products so much and learned so much from being able to use new programs on a machine that doesn't quit on me. My career path has rapidly changed to adapt to the new things I've learned, thanks to my MacBook Pro.   So, thanks for everything, Mr. Jobs. You rock.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs - a man who had really made dent in this universe. R.I.P
He was a visionary who shaped the world with his ideas. He was the source of inspiration not just for me but for many. May his soul rest in peace. I salute him. He was a great Entrepreneur. RIP 
Thank you to Steve Jobs for creating the intuitive and fun-to-us Apple alternative to the PC world, and making it available to the world. &nbsp;Condolences to his colleagues, friends and family.- (an Apple user from the beginning)
To his family, his close friends, his associates my deepest condolences. Tears run down of people from around the world, no matter where they are Steve Jobs changed their lives, even if they did not know so... and most of all Jobs inspired people with his vision and determination more than anyone else in his time. Such a short life but so much done. I am truly sorry.
Ever since I was little when I was in class and they asked me who my hero was I always answered "Steve Jobs". Steve was a true hero to the world in everything he did. It was always my hope to meet Steve and I am saddened to find out that this will never happen. As I sit here on my iPhone with my iMac in front of me I remember how much Steve has changed the world. Steve is and will always be my hero.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was and always will be my inspiration to reach success. He was the subtlest, classiest and most intelligent person of this century. You will be missed Steve.  
Your contributions to the field will be missed.&nbsp;
 I will miss you Steve and your gifts you shared with the world. The world is better because you used your gifts from God - God showed off in and through your life.   Thank you. God bless your family.&nbsp;
He seemed like a good person, and someone who wanted to be fair to all  the people, who purchased apple products, he cared for the consumer, and  gave the most he could, and delivered the best, he was a genius.  He is  missed, even by those who didn't no him personally.  Always wondering,  what would he come up with next, he was amazing.  He is in my thoughts.&nbsp;
Thanks for everything Steve.   Rest In Peace.
Dear Apple Family,&nbsp;  I send you my condolences for the loss of a great leader and innovator. Thank you for the tribute homepage on Apple.com. You do this with class and style in true Apple &amp; Steve Jobs fashion.&nbsp;  An ever faithful &amp; appreciative MacHead
I only hope when i go i do it as bravely as steve did
You have changed our lives and shown the world things we thought we'd never see. More importantly, you have inspired millions of people to become the people they are today. Thank you, you will be missed.
A deeply sad day for me. Steve Jobs changed my life in so many profound ways--how I accomplished my work day to day--how I interacted with my friends, family and colleagues--the way I talked on the phone--listened to music--watched movies--shared photos--filmed birthdays--created and shared memories--the way my daughter learned and played and interacted with technology,--and so much more. Steve Jobs changed how we "be" in this world, and his creative genius will leave a huge, gaping hole. He was an extraordinary man who lead people out of ordinary times.  He will be remembered.&nbsp;
I cannot possibly thank enough the genius who gave me in 1984 the precise computer I needed. I bought it in NYC betting against all other offers. I am today grieving this loss but I must think otherwise turning to the feeling of gratitude I owe him. He understood ME !!!&nbsp;
 Thank you for showing that what you build can change the world. Not only a popular gift you presented, but a spirit of innovation.             
His imagination and creativity has given me the tools I used to build my company and bring joy to my work. Thank you Steve
A truly inspirational creative talent. Loved his drive and ambition! A true great. A great lose to the world.
see you later... 
 Dear Steve Jobs, You are missed by all. Out of everyone that had made it   big just as you I do not think they have touched the hearts of so many  as you did. You and your intelligence will be missed by all. I want to  thank you for doing everything you have done to help us ordinary people  live an easier life. What you thought of not only made an empire of  Apple, but of you as well. You will be dearly missed friend. Now you may  rest in peace. I know Apple is in good hands, and you have set them out  for a great start... I will never say end, because Apple will live forever just as you will forever stay in our hearts. God bless you my  dear friend.
Mr. Jobs had such a life force that it is unfathomable that he is no  longer with us. I hope his family and friends know that he touched so  many people, and that he will always be associated with the awesome  apple brand. I hope he has found his peace. 
     I never had the honor to meet Mr. Jobs but I have always looked after him and his work. This year as part of my school year I made a promise to myself that I would listen to the speech he gave in Stanford University as a way to motivate myself and to truly find my path in life. I can now see and feel how people felt many years ago when they lost brilliant minds like Henry Ford and Thomas Edison, today we have lost our own. I hope this humble words help his family and friends to find comfort. We certainly know, today God needed a new iPad design in his kingdom. Thank you and God bless his family and friends.
I'm Korean apple user.  when I was young, and until now, I always loved,Mobile/cellphone. but lost an interest about that.  after a few years, I was experience to apple's iPod Touch.  I Thought, "it's Magical. revolutionary.it's fun, and easy. "  it was shock to me. Now, I Uses iPhone/Mac/iPad. Now, I have a dream, because of this product.  Now, dreaming of most top IT CEO   One more thing.....  I really thankyou to Steve &amp; his apple staff.   im sorry to my lack of english skills.
I will always remain inspired by Steve. He is gone very early in his life,  and this is an example to say you don't have to live long to leave your mark on this world.  If there was one remarkable leader in design for our time, it is Steve.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs showed me what it means to pursue your passion with  relentless force and tenacity. I never met him, but he has had a massive  impact on my creativity, drive, and confidence.
I'm no special than most that will be emailing. All I know is there will be no one like Steve Jobs. He pioneered the way to so many amazing advances in technology we have today. And I am beyond sure that he was a great friend and family man. Millions of people are thankful for the joy he instilled in people's life.&nbsp;
Steve, thank you for the extraordinarily positive and far-reaching impact you've had on our world. May you rest in peace. You will be sorely missed.&nbsp;
I'm not a techie. But Steve was an inspiration to all of us, kinda the way Michael Jordan inspired people who weren't sports fans to like basketball.  My heart goes out to Steve's loved ones - and I hope all of you know that you have family all over the world.  May Steve rest in peace.
I am not a hugely emotional person but this news has me glassy eyed.   Thanks Steve, see you on the other side. 
He was a brilliant man there will never be another like him R.I.P. Steve Jobs.
You will never be forgotten. 
Thank you Steve. The spirit of life lives within your creations.&nbsp;
I first get an apple product on 2008, and became a fan of apple in 30 minutes, it was an exigent moment, I feel that I had to know more about this company that to me was new then, I had follow apple since then in every presentation. As of today I am the proud Owner of a Mac book pro, an iPhone 4, an Airport Express and just got my iPad 2. I would like to have every single product of apple. I share my experience to remark the exquisite job of a man, who unfortunate today it's not longer in this world but, will live on the heart of all of us who love apple. God bless  the man and his legacy. My sincere condolence!&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs is inside of everyone, he had changed the world in all sense.  Now is our turn to make, as him, a difference around us.  I'll miss the black t-shirt and blue jeans.             
Thank you Steve Jobs. You changed the world . Your life and work is   an inspiration to me and my kids.  Thank You&nbsp;
I never had opportunity to met you, but I always be near of your ideas  behind your developments. I bought things that I never had to have  before and surely if it not from you it never happened. So I just can  say thank you for all things that you create. You are genius and GOD  call you to development something new there. Take peace! BYE.
An inspiration to the world through the genius of his mind worked through the power of his hand. RIP Steve.&nbsp;
I would like to say thank you to Steve Jobs who had dedicated to the world for his entire life. His contributions are very appreciated. May he RIP.&nbsp;
Because he lived am able to use a computer and iPad. God bless wherever he is.&nbsp;
I am very sad today. We have lost a genius!&nbsp;
Dear Steve, I just tell that you are a legend and you will never die for me... you changed the whole world with your iMac, your iPod and your iPhone ... thats why we can tell you rest in peace and the whole world wile never forget you ...            
  Hello,       While I have never met him personally I would like to say thank you to Mr. Jobs and his family for making my life easier and sometimes better with the products he created.  My prayers are out to his family in this most difficult of circumstances.       May God comfort you.  
Uncle Steve  My friends and I who have adopted Apple's technology call Steve Jobs  Uncle Steve. in the past I was a PC fanatic until Steve in his subtle  and powerful way of coming up with innovative products and marketing  them at  launch events made me a convert about 5 years ago when I bought  my first iMac. I have not regretted decamping from the PC world. Steve  in so many ways you have touched my life and countless others, you have  inspired us to believe in our selves and follow our vision, all I can  say is Thank You Uncle Steve..... Thank you, you will definitely be  missed. All the way from Africa.&nbsp;
You will surely be missed. Rest in perfect peace. <br>
He was amazing. &nbsp;I am an 11 year old and I will always remember Steve. I  appreciate him very much. I loved his inventions and how he created  them. Thank you Steve and please always remember that I loved what you  did! 
Steve was an visionary and an inspiration for anyone dealing with cancer.
Innovator. Rebel. Visionary. Tech Titan. A true American icon. The world will miss you, Steve. 
Mac user since 1984  Thanks for the memories. Thanks for caring about the things that matter and being smart enough   to prevail. Thanks for the audacity. Thanks for the clear sense of how things should be. Thanks for the fun of it all.  Our sincere condolences to the Jobs Family. In the end ... a father   and a husband.
Where to begin. I can merely offer my sincere gratitude for all Steve has done to change the day to day elements of life in music, business, communication and plain old living. He will never be forgotten. please keep his legacy at the root of all you do.
 Rest In Peace Steve Jobs, you are great and amazing people, no one can replace you. Love From Malaysia
Dear Apple,  My deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Steve.  You are in my  prayers and may God lift you up and hold you close during this time of  hardship.  Steve has taught us all to be our best, to strive for  excellence, and to never give up. His hard working attitude is a model  of what America is made of.  His care for not only his customers but for  his employees and company is something that we should all take to heart.   He will be missed and I doubt if we will ever see anyone so full of  life as Steve. God bless you all!
All i can say is god must have needed an iAngel!  
What a loss, our hearts go out to his family. 
Its a sad day..praying for him and his family.  Love yall.. 
 I am just an ordinary guy. But his products changed me and my children I am just grateful for changing the human race and especially my 12 year and  3 year old's learning ability I can just say "thank you" from the bottom of my heart to him and his family  Thank you
Such an outlook.  We have come so far thanks to Steve Jobs and his visions.  Thank you. You will be missed. 
I know no words to ease your pain. It hurts too have lost someone as wonderful as it gives us the pleasure of acquiring a wonderful tool as my MacBookPro. For me he will always be an important person in my generation and I am sure that many past and to come.  I with family and close friends, may God give you strength and much love to takepower over their loss.&nbsp;
Really Thanks for everything Steve! i will always remember you, this  world is because of you, RIP Genius.
We knew he was sick, we knew we would lose him someday. I knew when he passed, that it would be impactful. I didn't really think about how sad I was going to be. I am sad. He impacted my life in a way that I could never have imagined, 4 years and 11 months ago when I started working at Apple. I never thought about how he would affect how I would affect others. My sincerest gratitude to a man who truly enriches my life every single day. I hope that he is proud. He should be.   Thank you Steve. We will all miss you, and will do our best to carry on with your vision in our souls to be true to ourselves and to truly enrich others lives.
Steve,  You inspired me a lot in my life for what a person can achieve if the person has passion.  May your soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
 Tu eres y seras un ciudadano ejemplar, dios tenga a bien cuidarte Adios Steve...            
I was having a really good day so far, but that news just brought me down.   I feel very sad and depressed right now.  I would just like to thank him,  a genius, for his spirit, and his effort of making the apple products so beneficial for many people.  RIP Steve Jobs 
 Rest in peace Steve, you did a great thing&nbsp;
I speak on behalf of myself and the company I represent when I say that Steve Jobs was a revolutionary inspiration and a true visionary.  His technological conceptions have forever changed and enhanced our business and the way we interact with our clients and customers.  We are forever grateful for his contribution to society, the world and humanity.&nbsp;
Peace and love to the Jobs Family, Steve's Friends and the Apple Family. Steve will be missed by all.  His brilliance, his passion, his drive and most of all his willingness to share life lessons. Nothing really dies, his energy will always live on.
Steve will always be in our hearts, a great revolutionary genius and will always be remembered. 
Today we lost a great man who changed the way we function through technology. Steve Jobs is an inspiration for me.&nbsp;
I don't have word to say what i feel but i know that the world lost an exceptional person!!  Good bless steve jobs
Steve Jobs inspired me by his achievements. His reputation for quality  at all costs and mantra of making things "Insanely Great" have been an  example to many. I hoped he would be the first human to live forever.&nbsp;
So very sad for one who did so much, and gave so much to his family, his company, his country and the world. The entire breath of humanity benefited from his presence and his genius. He was taken much too early. May his memory be  a blessing.
I offer my condolences to Steve Jobs and his family, and wish them all  the best. Steve was a great man that greatly shaped how the world  is today.  RIP Steve.
He changes my life, the way i think, the way i do, the way i love apple like  it in my blood.. Thanks for everything father..we love you
From the time of the iMac, I wanted an Apple, but my parents used to tell me, it works differently and there will be problems.  Then I grew up, I bought a Macbook, then an iPod (video, classic, nano) and an iPhone (2, 3, 3Gs and 4). I've never looked back, and there's no other platform I'd ever use, and it's all thanks to the genius called Steve Jobs.  The world can never thank you enough Steve, it's as though I feel your presence, soul and heart in every apple product I've owned. Thank you Steve.
Thank you. I love you. 
I wanna wish my sincere condolence to Steve's family  and to all  employee of Apple Computer .   May his spirit be in our minds forever.    R.I.P   Steve Jobs    thank you so much for all you've done  you made  computer life so much easier  . &nbsp;&nbsp;
This is being said from a regular student who has had a regular life.  Steve, if you could only have step into my life, just to see how you and  your company has changed it for the better. It goes further than your  products, and memories you help provided with Pixar. You honestly made  me feel like I could do anything. I can. I believe in myself to be the  best professional I can, and to follow my dreams. I want to do what you  did. I am blessed to have been able to have you in my life, if not  directly. Nothing will be the same. Thanks.we all love you.
RIP Steve you were an amazing man and a pure genius! 
Not many people can say they lived doing what they loved to do.&nbsp;
RIP Steve. You changed the lives of everyone on the planet. You have truly paved the way for future generations to continue your work. God Bless you Steve, sorry to see you go. I grieve for you and your family. 
Dear All, I am so sad to hear that Steve Jobs passed away. He was one of the great heroes of our times. My feelings are with his family and all who loved him.&nbsp;
 An example of entrepreneurship and ingenuity.            
I was shocked today when i heard that Steve passed away, a great human being and a role model for our&nbsp;life. We miss you so much steve. Condolences to family and friends.&nbsp;
Steve does not know us but we know him and will love him forever. He was our family and we are as sorry as we have lost a very dear family member and a friend. He had a magical affect on all our lives and we will miss him real bad. World will remember him as a man who has changed the lives of millions and I think he changed an era in the world history. He will continue to help to generations to come with his genius ideas. He was so young to leave us . I hope Apple can find the means to realise whatever he wished to achieve. Thank you Steve for coming into our lives and making it so much more fun . 
Dear Mrs Jobs, I am really sorry to hear about this! A great THANK YOU to Mr.Jobs for all the things he's done, for that he opened a whole new world to me!  He inspired me greatly and I am sure such spirit would be with me forever! I am just writing to wish you and your children all the best!&nbsp;
Mr. Jobs The world will never forget you!!!!&nbsp;
The world would not have been the same without iPod, iPhone or iPad, but none of these would have ever existed without iSteve. R.I.P. Mr Jobs. iPray.&nbsp;
Many years ago, I was child, growing up in the dawn of the computer age.   My father worked for a company called NCR.  I grew up with a  fascination for all things electronic, especially those early computers.   Dad took me to the computer shows, and I learned to build my own PC,  run various versions of DOS, etc. My first encounter with an Apple Computer was on a field trip to a local  college, where they'd just begun to use them in a science lab.  It was  the old box, with one of the earliest 3.5 floppy drives, and no mouse. My, how things have changed.  When I met my husband, the Apple products  were all he used in his office.  His family had been early adopters, and  told stories about being some of the earliest users of some of the  Microsoft products for them.  Today, our house is filled with Apple  products - computers, iPhones, the iPad my father in law uses, and I've  been toying with the iTV idea for ages. Thank you, Steve, for all that you gave us.  Your innovative ideas took  what was once just a work tool to being the device we carry everywhere.   Rest in peace. 
I had the privilege of working for Apple from 2007-2010, until I left to stay at home and raise my daughter. Those were and will always be some of the best years of my life, and I have Steve Jobs to thank for it. His vision, passion and determination helped to create something that continues to transcend all expectation. I am truly sorry for the loss of this great visionary, yet glad to know that his legacy will live on for generations to come.&nbsp;
Like when the music world lost Freddie Mercury and has never recovered, so too has the technology world lost a hero and will never recover. Words can't describe the loss by anyone, I'm sure. I send out my deepest, most sincere condolences to his family whom he obviously loved very much. Thank you for all you've done, Mr. Jobs.   
An Apple II+ was my first introduction to a computer, and despite being forced to deal with other machines and other OS's, I always came back to Apple, because it was always better. Thank you Steve! It may sound corny, but your inventions actually DID change my life, and made it perceptibly better. RIP.&nbsp;
Hi, I have never met Mr. Steve Jobs in my life. Never have I seen him in real nor been on a conversation with him .My only glimpses into his world were what I could capture from the Media and the Digital channels. Yet there have been few people who have inspired me the way he did. Agreed he did bring out a technological revolution for us and ushered in an era of life changing products that have and shall go a long way in redefining our lifestyles and thinking. But the more impact I feel he made was through the manner in which he lived his life, somewhere even at that height of success, Jobs knew what was truly pivotal and center to one's life. His ideas have been paradigm shifting and revolutionary. But his Aura stems from his Humility, straightforwardness and hard work. Even though I never had the opportunity to meet him in this life I consider myself fortunate to have lived in his era to have an insight to his world. At the center of all iDevices, Jobs had one fundamental process that came straight from the heart iBelieve May his soul rest in peace.
Steve, you were a game changer - all your incredible software got me excited about the arts, especially photography.  You will definitely be missed.   
Thank you for helping to shape his future.&nbsp;
We have him to thank for visionary inspirations from both inside Apple  and his effects on the world around us. Thank you Steve Jobs for  changing my life and making it a bit easier to live and share in the  biggest and smallest of ways.&nbsp;
I wanted to take a moment to thank Apple and Steve for making such a  difference in my life and the tech industry. I would not be in the IT  industry if it wasn't for Steve and his innovative genius. When we look  back on his life he will be remembered alongside the likes of Edison,  The Wright Brothers, Bell, and Einstein. We have lost a true genius.
Of course u are in the iParadise..!!! Hope you'll send us some nice  idea from there of course using Airplay..
I am no one really special but yet my entire life has been revolutionized by Steve Jobs. Every once in a while we all encounter a "great": MLK, John F. Kennedy, Mother Theresa, etc. Steve Jobs was a "great" to me. In a highly competitive market he was able to mastermind greatness, for that I am grateful. Rest in peace and may your legacy live on beyond your wildest dreams.&nbsp;
Thank you for your passion and effort.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs: Someone who dreamed bigger, worked harder, and  revolutionized the computer industry. 
I know maybe anyone will read this message; but thanks to your products and insanely amazing vision. I am the iOS developer; I am right now.  Thank you Steve. We will miss you&nbsp;
Thanks. Thanks for giving me a chance to dream with a better world.&nbsp;
Death can't stop creativity. Thanks for your mind, Steve.&nbsp;
 Steve Jobs will be remembered for the superior products his leadership brought to the world. The vertical integration of Apple in the marketplace is his mark of excellence which others merely try to emulate, but fall short of the standards he set. He is the KING. The KING is dead. LONG LIVE THE KING!&nbsp;
You my dream Missionary. You best. 
Dear Steve,  Thanks for making computers and other electronic products useful for people  who are technologically challenged like myself.  All of Facebook is sending their regards and condolences but the greatest irony is that most of them are probably expressing themselves through some product of yours be it an iPhone, or a Macbook.  You certainly left an imprint on my generation and for that I thank you.  When I become a lawyer someday, I will definitely continue to use a Mac over  a PC (even though the legal profession is 30 years behind on computers).
There are 3 most important apples that are part of human history and future. Adam's that he ate, Newton's that he discovered and Jobs's that he built. RIP Steve ! 
Steve left us, but we will never leave Steve's legacy. Run Steve, run!&nbsp;
The world has lost one of the greatest computing visionaries of our  time. He will be truly missed. All the best to his family during this tragic time and long live Apple! &nbsp;
Although I have never met Steve, I know that in every Apple product I have exclusively used for over a decade, I can find a part of him. It is sad to learn of his passing, but perhaps he won't be in much pain from his illness any longer. He will truly live on in his namesake of Apple.&nbsp;
Rest in peace.......&nbsp;
  I am a designer from China, very sad to hear this news. the world has lost an amazing human being,great leader, a great genius, great designer, Steve Jobs!             
Apple products has changed my life!!  
Got my first apple in 1980; and never looked at anything else - -  Thanks, Steve, for freeing me from basic computers - and BASIC    :You'll always be online at Apple.com:
Creator that we have been so fortunate to have in our generation.
Thank you Steve for everything you gave us - your genius, your energy,  your dreams...yourself. You changed us. You changed the world.  It doesn't seem that long ago that I saw you in person standing on the  corner of Pine and Sansome Streets in San Francisco. You were in a  pristine blue suit, white shirt, and widish blue tie, talking to an  older banker type gentleman. You were so young - youthful, yet elegantly  fitting into the financial district.  The intervening years have been incredibly full and have moved at a  dizzying pace.  Safe travels.  Respectfully and with admiration~
Thanks for everything Steve.  Someday we'll meet in the iCloud. We'll miss you a lot!
When Walt Disney died, many of us thought that all was lost. Fortunately, his work and his vision, his dream, lived on. Disney was a man that showed us all that Magic could come true.  Steve Jobs' work and vision will live on too. He will remain, to many, the Disney Pioneer of the 21st Century. Jobs was a man who showed us that Magic could be held in your hand. And that the Magic can be shared with others.  Written on my Mac. Posted for the world to see. As if by Magic.
My condolences to Steve's family, friends, and colleagues.  I never met Steve Jobs, but he touched my life in many ways.  It was  1979 - I had dropped out of college and was biding my time, wondering  what I'd do next, when I came across an Apple II Plus in a department  store.  I spent my college savings (against my parents' wishes) to buy  one.  It changed my life.  After 32 years in the IT business, I still  love and use the products he created.  The iPhone and iPad are perhaps  the most transformative pieces of art and technology ever created.  Steve made a bigger positive mark on the world than anyone since Thomas  Edison.  Thank you Steve!
Without Steve Jobs Apple wouldn't be here there would be no revolution  he was a inspiring man i will be very sad that i will never be able to  hear him in his keynotes and speeches again, Steve Jobs will always be  in our minds our hearts and everywhere in between i will miss you a lot  steve&nbsp;
As I type this on my iPad, having wrestled it away from my 3 year old, I realize that Mr Jobs' vision and Apple's creations have permeated my family's way of living. While no doubt Apple will carry on revolutionary thinking, Mr Jobs' passing is surely a collective loss.  Condolences to all who had the privilege of knowing him.
Dear everyone  Steve Jobs changed my life for the better. &nbsp;I link my hand with yours now as we grieve over this news. &nbsp;His impact and those who worked with him have changed the world for the  better. &nbsp;My head is low, my walk will be slow for awhile and my gratitude  sincere. I wish his family (wife, children and friends) safety as we enter a  period of mourning and probably distraction from all that's "normal".  I know it will feel surreal for awhile. &nbsp;Thank you for allowing me to write through the tears. I'm hanging in there because, in fact, it's been a great ride for him  and now the baton's been passed.  Time now for us to hold up our end.
RIP Steve Jobs. You gave me the inspiration to know that standards aren't for obeying; they are for exceeding. You'll be missed 
You let the user experience really reached an unprecedented level, without one, you are the best!
I'd like to thank Steve jobs for what he has done for the technological world  and for being my idol/ role model. Without him I probably wouldn't be the same person I am today. My iPhone and  Mac are my favorite devices. To me they're more then just pieces of technology, they have shaped my life and made it magical and extraordinary.  I wish apple all the best and hope they can keep inventing breakthrough technology that Steve would be proud of. Thank you   
Dear Steve,  I'm a Chinese high school student in U.S. now. I first time knew you is a biography about you. And from that time, I fell in love with your characteristics. Now I'm definitely a big fan of you and Apple. I hope you will be happy in the heaven.&nbsp;
I have no specific story to tell, I never had the honor of meeting Steve Jobs. But suffice to say that as a consumer and as a follower of the tech industry, I respected him hugely and never failed to recognize that in every single product there was effort to push to the cutting edge and to give the consumer something that he/she would genuinely appreciate - something that would last. I really can't say more than that. I'm stunned and saddened and I send my best to his family&nbsp;
 Y ahora quien va a revolucionar el mundo de la tecnología, DEP Steve Jobs !!  And now who is going to revolutionize the world of technology, RIP Steve Jobs !!              
Gracias por haber hecho progresar al el mundo...  
Rest in Peace, Steve Jobs. You've chaged alot of things.. ..More than you can imagine.  Long live all magic you made amd bring on all the pretenders. Today, (and forever) you will be remembered.&nbsp;
The lost of any human being is a sad event, the lost of one whose strong leadership and unique sense of style  is no less, but he'll be remembered fondly by everyone who was touched by his charisma. Let his spirt not only be the foundation, but the guidance of the company he devoted his life to. His body might left this world, but He will never truly die. RIP Steve Jobs 1955-2011  --  "Im not here for the path ahead of me,but because of the path that lies behind me" 
You changed so many lives around the world including mine. You were, are and will always be my hero! Rest in peace!     
Steve,  You will be always remembered in our hearts. Today, this world lost a true genius and visionary human being ever lived on this planet of earth.  Your legacy will live forever until the end of this world.  Rest in peace.
Your products have become an every day part of my work life, personal life and family life.  God  has blessed you all with great creative talent.  I will pray for Mr. Jobs' family.
All my sympathy to his family and colleagues.  He was the best.
I am saddened to hear the news of Steve Jobs passing. In 1984, when I turned 16, I asked for some Apple computer stock from my grandparents. A strange request from a young woman and even stranger still stock from a little computer company. I tracked Steve Jobs from way back then!!  My first computer as a freshman in college was an Apple IIc. I thought I'd died and gone to heaven!!  That was just the beginning of a 25 year love affair with Apple computer and Steve Jobs!!  Rest in peace!  Thank you for all your contributions!  You have changed the world and left your mark!  You will always be remembered!!   
I write this upon hearing the news of Mr. Jobs passing.  I remember seeing some of the original advertisements for Apple in which Mr. Jobs had taken part.  They inspired me to purchase an Apple IIc clone, and I bought the clone because I couldn’t afford the real thing.  Up until now, some 25 years later, I haven’t been able to afford to purchase the products.  I recently purchased an iPhone 4 and an iPad 2 after saving for them for quite a while.  The reason I bought them was because of the way they were built as far as quality and the reputation of the company of which Mr. Jobs built.  I wish I could purchase more but that  is beyond my means at the time of this writing.  My heart and soul goes out to the Jobs family and would like them to know that the tech world as a whole will miss Mr. Jobs but he will live on in our thoughts and in the company for years to come.  He has long been admired, maybe even jealously admired.  Mr. Jobs has influenced so many people.&nbsp;
Rest In Peace Steve Jobs... 
God Bless you Jobs wherever you are ...
i never met the man personally but if i did it would have been a honour what he has done for the computing world is massive. i now own a macbook pro iphone 3gs ipod nano and looking to own many more  no of these devices would have been possible without him  so steve jobs u are a legend in my eyes 
Steve was not only a visionary but a complete game changer. I remember first seeing a computer in my first grade class, it was an apple. Too young to really know what it was, I remember that we referred to it as time to play with the apple. The amazing revolutions in not only the computer industry but in every facet of communications are because of his fearless visions that things could be easier, better and faster.  thanks Steve for chasing a dream!!!!
 I never got the chance to meet him, but I think everyone knows he will always be an incredible man that has truly changed the world. He has changed the way many people live their lives, myself included, and I am sincerely thankful for that. His technology has saved my life, therefore he has saved my life. I hope Mr. Jobs (and everyone else at Apple), knows how much they have contributed to this world, and that we appreciate everything they have done.   You are a lovely man Steve Jobs.              
Who else could inspire artists and engineers alike? Who else could make  people love something as utilitarian as their phone?  We will miss Steve in many ways but perhaps most miss his inspiration.&nbsp;
Apple and the world of mobile has lost a great leader. Apple's backbone is steve who worked not only for betterment of apple but also for the betterment of human kind .  let his soul rest in peace.&nbsp;
Farewell to a great man- Steve Jobs understood that you don't need to be a computer to use a computer and unleashed the, "yes I can" mindset.   Without his contributions I would have never learned how to use a computer… a computer which I now use to run my entire life. Thank you Steve … the journey continues!
 You changed the world for the better, I am able to do what I do today to  the best of my ability just like millions out there using what you  created from an idea. A True Legend, You will greatly be missed but  never forgotten. Long Live Apple.
The entire Apple world will miss you Steve. May your soul rest peace.  Apple fanatic from Nepal.
Rarely is the world touched on so many planes, technological, lifestyle, arts, business, by a single person.  Over the years, the world has had its geniuses. We have seen the likes of Copernicus, Beethoven, Einstein, and Jobs. All creating paradigm shifts, all forever changing the course of history.  Requiescat in pace Steve. You have done your day's work, and infinite more. We will miss you and do our best to keep your legacy alive.  Thank you.
I've never been a totally keen Apple enthusiast, nor do I own an iPhone,  but I do have  MacBook Pro, and I know that thousands of e-mails must be  read that state this same thing, but I owe all my successes so far to  his creations, whether he designed them or not.  Steve always seemed down to earth, to the average Apple consumer anyway.  I bought my laptop with the safe knowledge that it would last me a good  while, and it has, all down to the fact that he said it would.  It has deeply saddened me that at 2.20 in the morning, when I switched  my Mac on and opened Safari, I was greeted with the image of Steve and  his dates of birth and death. He was a true inspiration, not only to  computer-based enthusiasts, but to people willing to push themselves in  any field.  I'm not going to go on about how great he was, because everyone knows  that anyway. I just give my condolences to his wife and children, and  hope that the world can accept and embrace what a true visionary he was.  Thanks for the laptop, Steve; you've changed my life.&nbsp;
I just want to say, thank you and well done.&nbsp;
My deep condolence, RIP Mr. Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs is a great American. He is the role model. Rest well, Mr. Jobs... 
Your vision and dreams will live on; we are grateful for your contribution to mankind.&nbsp;
To the family and friends of Steve Jobs,  My condolences to you all.  I was hoping that Steve would win the battle of the illness.  What a remarkable man to have changed the lives of millions of people and a legacy he has left.  So sorry to hear the news.&nbsp;
也不知道你看不看得懂中文，只是想表达自己对一个伟人家人的安慰，关心、  希望您可以为乔教主，勇敢，坚强的好好生活。     我想乔教主一定也是这样想的，加油
I am feeling a personal loss even though I only knew his products, his   vision and his passion The world lost more then a man with ideas.&nbsp;
I am a non-tech grandmother whose life was made so much brighter by the  beautiful Apple products. Thank you. You are missed already.
I didn't know Steve Jobs, and of course never met him, but I have thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the enhancements that his vision brought to the world. Condolences to his family, friends, and colleagues who I feel must be experiencing an intense sense of loss today.  I hope that now the battle with cancer is over, there is some relief to be set against the fact that a gifted life was taken all too soon.
Tonight, my 8-month-old daughter and I FaceTime'd with my husband and  her daddy while we had our dinner.  He is an Air Force pilot who is  about to leave on a mission to Afghanistan. We are proud Mac users and will never forget the contributions to  society and our lives that Steve Jobs made.  Thank you Steve Jobs for being a pioneer and dedicating your life to  being an innovator of technology.  -
for all the things you have allowed me to accomplish with such beauty and elegance, i deeply thank you.
Steve,  As I grew up I was always drawn to technology, computers, and the like. I have always loved music and in my younger days I went through a variety of music Mp3 players and my wife knew what I really wanted was an iPod. She surprised me with a 40GB iPod for Christmas and my life was changed for ever. Now 7 years later, and numbers MacBooks, iMac's, iPods, and iPhones, I am forever in your debt for the way you changed the world.  Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
The news shocked me today when I heard of the passing of Steve Jobs. Steve has made such a big influence on how we use technology today. I remember my dad had the very first Apple computer that was made. I really didn't know Steve personally but I know that he is in a better place right now. Hopefully he can even show the Lord some of his useful technology!
What an unbelievable person!! The world is a better place today because of him. He will be remembered for centuries to come and to have known of him is a true honor.&nbsp;
Unbelievable, how courageous this man was. He remained actively engaged in the well being of this Apple of his and he lived very professionally throughout his life. God bless him and keep him in good company. I have learned so much.
With Deepest Symphaty... We will miss you Steve Jobs.
Thinking about the loss of a truly visionary individual, those of us who are fortunate enough to work with apple products he helped bring to market have all experienced some of the creative genius that is Steve Jobs.  His legacy will live on through the innovations and, more importantly, the ideas he brought into our consciousness.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  For more than 30 years, no computer other than an Apple has ever graced  my household. And professionally, only one job during my career has been  "Mac-free." I was fascinated, captivated and captured as a member of the  cult of Mac since my first Apple II a long, long time ago.  I think I can speak for millions of Apple computer users when I say  without your vision, drive and aesthetic sense, we'd never have known  such wonder, joy and outright bliss of using a product that simply  worked. Period.  You were incredible. &nbsp;Insanely great! I am incredibly saddened by your  passing. You've left us much too soon, but  THANK YOU FOR CHANGING THE WORLD!! Thank you for changing my world.  It has been a privilege to benefit from your brilliance.  Farewell Mr. Jobs. Godspeed. You will never be forgotten.
He was a genius, what made America great. We will miss him greatly because too many leaders today sit back collect golden parachutes, he was the true meaning of innovator.  He should be remembered with the likes Edison, Ford, Carnegie and Rockefeller. 
My first computer that I bought was a Mac and ever since that, my  computers that I've bought is only Mac and will ONLY be a Mac.  RIP Steve Jobs&nbsp;
 Mr. Jobs, your vison is now the world vision. Thanks for changing our lives.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was the man. He was a true innovator and genius. He inspired young and old and his ideas changed the lives of so many. &nbsp;
 ...my working life would not have been possible without you.  Simple really.  Lots of love and thanks.
 I can't believe it auctually happened!! Steve Jobs had always  being my role model.  Now he is gone, I feel so sad right now because I  don't think there will be another human being who will change the world  like Steve Jobs did. I just wanna say that I will remember you FOREVER  and thank you for making us those incredable devices, will when I  brought my first apple product, just after a week or less I don't view  them as a electronic device anymore, it is more like a family member  that I rely on, I really don't know how my life is going to be without  the APPLE FAMILY.  
I am shocked! Then I cried. Steve is my hero and my model inspiring me to pursue my dream and follow my heart. Best wishes to his families and God bless. &nbsp;
I just wanted to express my words of sorrow. For me, Steve was more than an inspiration. It was really sad news to hear about Steve. Since he got sick, I followed his health news. I have an idea about making stickers saying "Thanks Steve" that people could paste on their macs, ipod, etc. in honor of Steve.
My deepest condolences to Steve's family, and co-workers who considered him as family. The world has lost not just an amazing genius, but a wonderful human being. His legacy &amp; great innovations will forever be marked in human history.&nbsp;
May Apple honor his existence and respect his legacy.&nbsp;
Well this is a big hit on the community i remember when i was a kid i went trick or treating in his area in palo alto and my friend stole a rubber chicken from his door step after we got candy funny. but you will be missed Mr. jobs thank you for all the products you have made and every ground you have broke. Your work will go and be told you have paved the way for many things to come thank you sir you will be missed travel well my friend.
You will be missed but not forgotten. You were more than the founder of Apple...you were the hope and pride of a people that spanned the entire world. Steve was a person that comes into our world only once in a lifetime.  You will be missed.
Remembering Steve will not be a difficult thing. His visions have  touched so many lives, it's inevitable that his 'life' will live on  within those lives.&nbsp;
I was saddened when he stepped down from Apple, one because such a profound visionary had left a company I have been wowed by since switching to Mac in 1998. But also, because we all knew it had to mean he was still so sick. If he had run for President, he would have had my vote. He got the job done, always exceeded expectations and was always two steps ahead of everyone else. I don't think there will ever be another visionary like him, but we can hope. He will be greatly missed. He truly was the business man we should all strive to measure up to.&nbsp;
The Apple computer was amazing, but what Steve Jobs did with the Macintosh and its legacy reaches farther than any iPhone. Generations of artists, creators, and visionaries learned to express themselves on the tools he helped design. His keen insight and vision turned technology upside down, from the Macintosh, to the iMac; from the first PowerBook to the MacBook Air, from iPod to iPad. As a former Apple employee and lifelong Apple user, I can only hope that he was at peace, with his family, and did not suffer when he passed. Goodbye Mr. Jobs, goodbye Steve. You will be missed, but never forgotten.&nbsp;
Inspiring people should live double to reach the future sooner for us all. Bye iSteve, we will miss you.
What a genius. What a contributor. Today the world lost a great man.  Condolences to his family and friends.
To the Jobs &amp; Apple family, It's with deep sadness that I express my condolences to your immediate  and extended family of supporters worldwide. No doubt, your lasting  memories and amazing achievements with this man will help you all be  strong and continue to motivate millions of us worldwide.&nbsp;
We have lost a legend, a visionary, an inventor, a meticulous genius.   God rest your soul and thank you for making my life better.
My career exists because of that Apple IIe computer, my first of many. I wri te software today because of the world that first computer opened up for me.  I've since worked with computers of every sort but Apple was my first. As I  type this on my iPhone I want to thank Steve Jobs for challenging what the i ndustry thought a computer could be.&nbsp;
you've become immortal, buddy &lt;3 
I have never seen Mr Steve Jobs in real life. But he touched my life in  an incredible way. I fell in love with Macintosh Plus and have never ever left apple ever  since. He has changed the world in more ways than one and I would like to thank  him for changing mine. May his spirit lives through Apple.&nbsp;
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationships, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. This makes the world feel so small...everyone connected right now. Good bye Steve Jobs.&nbsp;
There are some people who, solely by being on this planet, have changed it profoundly. Steve Jobs is one of those individuals. Long live Apple Computers.&nbsp;
Steve, Thank you for your incredible legacy to the world in so many areas, but  above all, to be a man who trully believed the power of ideas. You'll  always be referenced as a true genious. Rest in peace.&nbsp;
 I never met Steve Jobs but,   He created my ground,   He practically created all my things,  He was my idol, he opened my mind,  He is my inspiration, in life,   I will take his example for the rest of my life,  He defined my life  path, I will always remember him,  Only he could have built the most innovative company ever,  Only he could have created the music, technology  revolution  I will miss Steve Jobs, very much.
In 1994 my parents got their first personal computer. It was a Mac and since then we've always had Macs. In 1995 I saw Toy Story and in 2011 I moved to LA to pursue a career in the film industry. Steve gave me the tools and inspiration to become a filmmaker and that path of mine has just started as he is leaving. I never will know him, but he has helped so much.  Thanks Steve Jobs, RIP.
You will live forever in the hearts of those who love technology.  R.I.P Steve Jobs!&nbsp;
To whoever reads this, I'd like it to be known that I'll never forget Steve. Nor will I take for granted what he has done.&nbsp;
I am very saddened to hear that our friend, mentor, and inspiration Steve Jobs passed away. I will always remember him as a visionary, a person that looks at technology as a gateway to improve our lives. Steve Jobs and the iconic quote "But wait there is more" will be greatly missed. We will always love you Steve.
Steve,  Thank you for sharing your amazing talents with the world through the  Apple company. You will live forever!
Thank you for giving me the advise I needed Steve - I will remain hungry and foolish! The soundtrack to my life is always and forever enjoyed on my iPod.
Thank you, Mr. Jobs for sharing with this world the gifts that our  Creator gave you to share with us:  inspiration, innovation, vision,  opportunity...possibility.  Your star will forever shine bright. May your soul peacefully rest and God's grace and peace adorn your  family.&nbsp;
We are all going to the party.  See you there Steve.  See you there.&nbsp;
Thank you for inspiration, and for truly making the world a better place. 
What a genius. My heart goes out to his family.  
I was shocked when I woke up this morning, reading all the news about Steve Jobs. And suddenly I remember the day I knew this guy and his famous speech. And his words *Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish.* Thanks to this guy I never met, I keep moving in my life time. And thanks to what he has done in Apple, the significance of his work to expand my knowledge about life and work. He should be in the world forever, even just watching us to grow up...  thanks - you're the best. R.I.P.
While Apple and the world have lost a great visionary and great leader, Steve's family has lost the most important thing...a husband, a father, a son, and to them, a hero.  God Bless Steve and his family.&nbsp;
Thank you for all you have done for the world of Telecommunications. Your contribution to technology has changed the landscape of our everyday lives in so many ways.  May you continue to elevate, innovate, and communicate from the next dimensions.&nbsp;
There is no easy way to say or write this letter, first and foremost my prayers go out to Steve Jobs' family and friends. I would like to give thanks for everything and everyone involved in Steve Jobs life and without the tech that has been inspired by Steve Jobs and everyone else involved, I could not see any other way to stay connected to my family and friends as easy without the iDevices of todays generation and to be part of Steve's Jobs tech era, i'm just glade to have lived in this time era and to be able to own the products that came from Steve Jobs heart and soul.   We will miss you and your inspiration, from the words of Steve Jobs (it just works)  everything will work out and the love out there for you is undoubting enormous, you will be missed.
Hi Steve,       You saved me from my isolation, and mental breakdowns during my teenage years. I'm a minority and you have inspired me to change many things in the world. Few words are all I need at this moment, because its too much to bear, Goodbye you amazing visionary 
I am a 17 year old kid. I'm not really in the "cool" crowd and that's  because I'm a huge geek that only knows about video games, music, and  most importantly tech that no one really cares about. Steve Jobs has  shown to me that it's alright to be a little geeky, I can still be me. Steve also has had an impact on me through his dedication to his work.  He seemed to be so in love and always seeking for the best with his  work. I'm currently writing this through my MacBook while my iPod is plugged  in and Syncing. Apple is one of my favorite companies, and that's mainly  because of the image Steve Job has  presented. My thoughts go out to Apple and Steve's friends and family.
thank you Steve.
I can remember back when I was about nine years old and my father purchased his first Macintosh computer. I can remember how excited our family was and how pleased my father was with it. My father is a very busy man, and needs a computer that works. Ever since that day, I was an Apple geek. I am currently 14 and love Apple and everything it represents. I have only began to write some simple applescripts and started to study what make computers tick. I have also learned about they're history. After watching Pirates of Silicon Valley, I learned more about Steve Jobs. I admired his ways, and the entire aspect of "think different". I always watched the keynotes, not only to find out what new products I can wish for, but to see how Steve addresses people on various subjects. He was a fantastic speaker, and I will always miss his presentations. Steve Jobs was my hero, and still is. I hope Apple will continue to create fantastic products that reflect the philosophies and ideas of Steve Jobs. I know they can, and always will. Steve Jobs opened the door to the future, and now we can proceed to go through that door and beyond. Steve Jobs has not died. He will live on through every iPod, Mac, iPad, and any other device that has the ? Apple Symbol on it. Every time I look at my mac or iPod, I shall remember him, as millions of others will too. He passes as one of the few who can say "I have changed the world". The world will never forget Steve. I believe I am now running out of words. Probably because, well, there are none to describe the loss the world is faced with. To the family and close friends of Steve: I give you my condolences and for the record, there are tears on my wireless apple keyboard. To all the other crazy ones, misfits, rebels, trouble makers, round pegs in square holes, and the ones who see things differently: Never let the spirit of Steve die. We are all crazy enough to change the world. Hopefully, some of us will.   Thank you Steve, for all that you have given the world.&nbsp;
To Steve Jobs,   I have been using apple products for about 3 years now and my friends  always ask me, "why do you have an iPOD touch? It's so expensive"... Or sometimes they ask, "why did you buy that mac notebook for? You  could've bought something with more capacity for less $$$". The apple icon is a symbol of entrepreneurial genius and for me,  investing in an apple product means I am not just investing in an idea,  I am investing in a lifestyle. The apple icon represents the hard work, dedication, diligence and the  go forward attitude of one man's will (Steve Jobs) to create an icon  that stood for these values. Sure they may have their problems and technical issues that do spring up  from time to time, however this represents the process that Steve Jobs  probably had to go through to create what is now an incomparable brand.  The man truly was a true  visionary and I am saddened by his loss,  however he leaves behind his legacy and that is what a man truly hopes  to do when he leaves this world.&nbsp;
Thank you for having created the Macintosh. From a fan who will always be faithful. &nbsp;
The best entrepreneur so far, a huge legacy for mankind, incredible innovations that changed my life.   Thanks   To Apple:  I noticed on yesterdays product launch, there was an empty chair in the front seat of the auditorium marked reserved.  I hope it was reserved for steve, and among the many, many rituals that will be developed on its legendary founder, that empty chair at every mayor apple event should remain empty for steves memory, and the comfort of his soul, just in case he feels like visiting. 
No words can ease the grief that Steve's family and friends are feeling.&nbsp; May they just know that the world was touched by an amazing man, a man who was taken too soon.&nbsp;    My thoughts and prayers are with his family. God Bless
Apple has lost the best device it ever had....&nbsp;
As a late Apple fan, I always had PCs, throughout the years  I always admire d the amazing genius of Steve Jobs and followed his career. I and my family are sadened by his passing away. I sincere condolences to the family and to the greater Apple family! <br>
Steve,  We have never met, spoke, or to my knowledge, been in the same state together. Despite this, you have inspired me in many ways, such as my work ethic, personality, and most importantly, my view on the world and life.  I can't say that I was an Apple fan from the beginning, in fact, I used to be "anti-Apple". This changed during your keynote speech where you introduced OS X Leopard.  I have never seen a member of a company so totally inspiring when delivering a keynote, let alone a CEO. It was not the features of OS X Leopard that made me want to purchase my first Mac, it was your your passion, your energy that you had for the product. That is was really drove me to Apple. I have watched everyone of your keynote speeches since, every time I am amazed at how excited you are about the new product that you are introducing. I watch your commencement speech at Stanford when I need to be inspired.  To quote you, "Death is life's greatest invention", which is sadly true. With you gone, the world seems a little less bright, a little less shiny.  Thank you for everything, you will most definitely be missed. &nbsp;
To the Jobs Family,     Our deepest condolences for your loss. Steve was given the gift of a vision so profound that changed the course of human kind, he shared that vision with us all. It is rare, that the achievements of one man alone could have the kind of positive impact as Steve did. We are grateful for having had Steve as part of my generation and we will celebrate his life.&nbsp;
The world has lost one of the brightest minds of our 20th century. Our lives wouldn't be the same without his mind, ideas, contributions to our style of life. Steve Jobs has been a milestone in the construction and development of our future. 
*Dear Steve:** * *You're the person that changed the world with that incredible innovative thinking, with all the risks that you took. You made that all that we though was impossible or unbelievable were real... you made the technology were like magic, because all your products are that... magic.* * * *   So, We'll remember you as a Genius, as a Wonderful person... but most important, as a Friend. * * * *   Goodbye Steve and thank you for all! We'll see!!!!!!!
To me Steve Jobs was, and will continue to be, the embodiment of the perfect visionary, leader and human being. A soul who was able to find his true calling and left the world a better place.  As I reflect on the direct impact Steve has had on my life it really does amaze me. At the tender age of 19 and fresh out of design school I got to work on my first mac. Sixteen years later and I am still Apple's biggest fan with no less than six apple devices forming a big part of my everyday life.   As a designer I couldn't do what I do best without my apple gear and I will be forever grateful for having been positively affected by this man who achieved so much is a relatively short span.  May you rest in peace Steve and know that you will inspire many generations.
I am truly saddened by Steve's death. I really can't describe this loss in human words. Steve will always be remembered and will live, in thoughts that transform human life,  inspiration for new ideas, ideas that take us beyond imagination and human being, for countless light years to come.
Truly a masterful story teller of future desires and dreams. Steve will be missed for his visionary passionate leadership of Apple. Prayers to his family and all all who loved him. &nbsp;
Steve, you were and always will be a legend. The world sees people like you only once in several hundreds of lifetimes, if ever. We are all so lucky to have lived during your lifetime. You can never fathom how many lives you have touched and changed immensely. Things won't be the same without you. Thank you for everything, and we miss you already. 
Thank you Steve Jobs for everything you did and for simply changing the world with your amazing vision. You are a true example of how things in life are  possible with motivation, dedication, ambition, and heart. My condolences goes out to your family. It has been an honor being part of your generation and your many history changes. My prayers goes out to the Job's family.
Like millions, I did not know him personally and yet he has been able to enrich my life by making it so much easier to access and enjoy things that are important. My condolences to his family, friends and colleagues. 
I did not know Steve jobs personally, but I feel like I knew him from the inspiring work he has done for apple and has shared with the world through these outstanding products. I love apple and I believe it's members give something back to the world that inspires others. Steve Jobs has always thought outside the box and I will be sure to follow his patterns as being a wonderful  CEO, leader, and one of the greatest and innovative inventors that the world has ever seen. Thank you Mr. Steve Jobs for everything you have done for both myself and the rest of the world. You will be greatly remembered.
I am so sorry for the loss of Steve Jobs. I was on the Apple website looking at the new iPhone 4s, when I went back to the main page and saw the picture of Steve. It may seem strange but I started to cry. I never knew Steve Jobs personally, but I looked forward to everyone one of his Keynote speeches and set reminders for when they would be on, so I could get excited about my next Apple purchase. We spend hours as a family in the Apple Stores, because it just feels like home. Steve was a brilliant man and so excited about his work! Not many people get to go to work each day and be that excited and proud of what you do for work.&nbsp;  To the Apple Team - know that Steve is still with each of you and he will be watching to see what great products you come up with in the future.  Make Steve proud!
Hello, everyone of Apple,  I never use Apple. But if you ask me, "Do you think Apple is great?", my answer is "YES"!&nbsp;
You will be  always missed and loved...  You will remain in my mind and heart.....you  will remain..in  the heart  of all  technology lovers......  How to say about such  a sad historical event!!!...  We have fall 50  years  behind.....while loosing greatest genius that  world ever can produce...  Rest in peace Steve (my ideal forever:((  )..... :((((((((&nbsp;
You, Steve... Made the difference! Rest In Peace! Thank you Steve Jobs. God bless you!&nbsp;
Sorry to hear about the world losing a great man! He will always be remembered, I will pray for his family and friends and also Apple the greatest Company! Love you all and be strong. &nbsp;
Thanks to a man and a company whose hard work and dedication has helped millions of other creative people get their ideas out of their heads and into the world to share with others.  He not only made the world a better place, but helped others make the world a better place.
My heartfelt condolence to the family. Thank you for the all the innovations and technology you have given the world. You will always be in our hearts and mind. You are a legend that will stay forever.     
He was a visionary, an innovator and an inspiration. He shaped the modern world as we know it. Although we mourn the loss of this marvel, we must also take time to appreciate all that he’s brought us. His death teaches us how we must make the most of our lives. Life is a delicate cycle however, if we work hard and dedicate ourselves to doing what we love as Steve did, the achievements of our lifetime can leave behind a strong impact.  *Steve Jobs, you are one of my biggest inspirations.*  This man, was the core of Apple.  Rest in Peace. 
We lost our legend.     We are feel very pround by living in the same atmosphere in nowadays.     There are so many programmers are created in the late 1990s in Korea.  And we are specially always respect him, the great Steeve Jobs.     We would always remember him and his creative sprit forever.  
Thanks a lot. For all the inspiration. For changing the world for the better. For showing us what a genius is. For showing what a person with determination can build. And rebuild.
It has been a tradition for me to sit in front of my computer to watch Steve introducing new Apple product ever since junior high every year.  still can't believe Steve is gone.  To Steve Jobs, the most innovative leader in the world.&nbsp;
             Steve created an extraordinarily powerful minority voice in             computing and culture. An amazing body of work; a later day             Edison.&nbsp;
To a man I've never met, I have never felt so inspired to create.  I  once was an adamant PC user.  I remember the cool, funky looking iMacs  in different colors along with one of the first Macs with the monitor  attached to the keyboard.  When my PC laptop finally crashed, I decided  to visit an Apple store (5th Ave. in NYC) and by taking some of the  complimentary workshops I was sold.  My black Macbook has allowed me to develop my career and has spoiled me  in many ways-- in terms of the amazing creative programs, the speed, and  did I mention the speed?  Apple has allowed a non-tech person like  myself to feel like a technological whiz!  And iTunes?  I couldn't live  without it.  Steve Jobs will truly be missed by everyone.  He made such an impact on  my life and everyone worldwide because he set the pace.  A genius, a  humanitarian, and ambitious . . . but ambitious to create the first of  firsts, that was Steve Jobs.  My best to his family.  I will continue to stay loyal to Apple because  they are a phenomenal company.
God bless you genius!
Sorry to hear the news. I wish there was more innovative product invented by u and I'm sure World will miss u!!&nbsp;
As one of the first women computer technicians in New Jersey in the mid  1980's, I repaired many Apple IIe's,  IIc's and their external disk  drives. I was most amazed though when working on a Macintosh and lifting off the cover and seeing the signatures of all the Apple team members.   It was with your direction and inspirations that Apple grew into the  wonderful company it is today. I enjoy my iPhone, Ipod,  macbook and  Ipad everyday. We are an Apple household! One of my favorite  expressions to some of my "windows friends" are, "with Apple, just plug  it in, it just works!" Today we mourn you like a family member and keep  the apple team  and your family in our thoughts and prayers. Rest In  Peace...&nbsp;
My heart goes out to Jobs' family and friends and the whole Apple team. I know you have lost a creative and powerful force of a man. I have enjoyed becoming an Apple geek and am consistently impressed with the products and innovations with environmental consciousness this company puts out.
Steve,  Thank you for devoting your life, to making everyone else's life better.   You will be in our prayers.  God Bless you my friend.&nbsp;
An inspirational figure who will never be forgotten.  RIP.&nbsp;
My condolences, although I don't know Mr. Jobs personally but the things that he have created really changed my life, I am a father of two and as we all know most children nowadays are more technologically savvy than their dad, Apple products bridge that gap between me and my children, I started being a Mac person when we first bought an iPOD and from there on has been a follower of whats going to be next.&nbsp; These gadgets allowed me to spend time with my kids share things that we like. Truly Mr. Jobs will be missed.&nbsp;
 To have never met a person I feel deeply saddened at this news. You need to stay strong and keep his vision alive. All of Apple and his family are in my thoughts.
Steve with one apple fed the whole world.
Your vision and creativity changed my life. Thank you.&nbsp;
I can't believe he's gone. It's crazy how two extremely isporational people have passed away in the last few months. Steve Jobs is truly an idol and has shown me what success is. Soon I'll be off to university with the goal of being like Jobs. A revolutionary man shaping the face of technology and also the world. It's incredible how Jobs and the visionaries at Apple have managed not only change categories such as the mobile phone but also lift off new categories with the début of the iPad. Though Steve Jobs is gone his legacy will live on through every new Apple product to hit the shelves. Also he will be greatly missed by those who were fortunate enough to know him closely and those who he has inspired such as myself. 
Thank you for all you have given the world. You are an inspiration. You help  bring to the world the most amazing phone ever. The Apple iPhone. Thankful f or all you've given us. Every time I see the Apple symbol. I will always think of you. Rest in peace.
Dear Ms Jobs, son and daughters, friends and colleagues  I am really sorry for your loss and I hope god will be with you in this hard times, we all know all over the world that Mr. Jobs was an amazing person, husband, father and a colleague.  We didn't only lose an inventor or a business man, but also a friend that will always be with Apple users all over the world.  I hope from god almighty to give peace to all of you.  Kind Regards
May his family, friends and loved ones, find peace and love in his  spirit and memories. 
Steve,  You are one great man, we will remember you forever.&nbsp;
Steve jobs made computers that were accessible to everyday people. People that weren't familiar with pc's could sit down an work on a Mac. You felt as though you were part of a special community, the Apple community. What other CEO gives his email openly an responds to his fans? Mr Jobs, you will never be forgotten an will always be remembered as a visionary to the tech world. My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of Mr Jobs.  Apple fan boy now and forever.&nbsp;
Thank you Steve. The world has seen only a few geniuses with the drive to make it count, you were undoubtedly one of them.   
 From that Apple SE to my ipad, and all the years in between... my   life has been enriched by the brilliance of this man.&nbsp;
Steve Jobs was a man that learned from his mistakes.  A man that boldly moved forward into new territory.  A man whose imagination wasn't bound by the limits of today.  Yet an ordinary man, living and working beyond ordinary limitations. He will long be remembered.  He will long be my measure of success.&nbsp;
You have been an inspiration and a leader in the tech world when it was needed. You changed how I worked and played and got my news, music, video, photography and communication with friends and family.  Thank you. May your spirit live on!&nbsp;
A exceptional man, a horrible loss. rest in peace.  
This truly is a saddest day of the silicon valley, we have just lost a real hero! Steve Jobs is the inspiration of everyone living here, he has changed our life forever &amp; he has changed the world we live in.   We will remember him forever as one of the greatest human being ever lived - a true genius by god!
I have been a passionate Mac user since 1989, when my father bought our first personal computer (an Apple Macintosh). I have watched (in awe) as a transformation happened under Steve's leadership - Apple users have turned from a specialized cult to a mainstream culture. It warmed my heart to see how the world became passionate about Apple in the same way that the long-time mac users have been feeling for many decades.  My girlfriend just told me the sad news, and I feel like I have lost somebody close and personal.  Steve, you will be greatly missed. May you Rest In Peace.&nbsp;
Steve and his gang humanized computers. No better example than when I bought my Mac Classic in 1988. It mesmerized my marine-engineer father-in-law and my two-year-old daughter. Thanks, Steve.
 May God strengthen and bless Steve's family and his Apple family as they deal with this great great loss. I never had the pleasure of meeting him but he had a soul and a personality that reached out through the computer and TV screen and made you feel as if you've known him all your life. I had a grand-aunt who passed away from Pancreatic Cancer a couple years ago and she was also a gentle soul who did her best to fight this sickness. I know what it is to watch someone you love battle this illness and to lose them sooner than expected. Steve was a great man and blessed the world with his intelligence and creativity and his memory will live on forever and his boldness will serve as an inspiration to many around the world. He helped to create a bridge to make the world a smaller and friendlier place by enabling people world wide to communicate and encouraging us to embrace technology to learn about each others cultures.&nbsp;
Steve - The world will miss you! May your soul rest in peace.. 
Even though I never knew Steve Jobs personally he will be missed not only by me but the entire world. The world was a much better place with him in it! I pray for his Wife, Children and Family! Rest In Peace Steve! You will always be remembered and honored! 
My sincere condolences to the Steve Jobs family and to Apple.  The world has  lost the most creative inventor the world has known.   Thanks Steve for enriching our lives with the most remarkable technology.&nbsp;
My life has revolved around Apple since my dad brought home an Apple II all  those years ago. I feel such a deep loss and hope that you, my favorite company, will continue to live and breath the courageous journey of innovation that Steve made his life's work. You will all be in my thoughts and prayers.  My warmest and most humble regards
We are so very sorry to hear about Steve. Our Prayers are with the family. 
Keep dreaming  Sent from my iPad 
I feel like we lost a visionary today. I see his products every single day of my life. He has impacted the technological world like no one else ever has. So, I would like to say thanks to Steve Jobs, your work has inspired many and influenced countless, rest in peace.
The world has just lost a visionary who shaped the foundation of the tech industry in a way only a few could. He will be missed immensely. R.I.P. Steve P. Jobs 
 The world has become a lot less interesting!&nbsp;
I was born to the computer world through Apple and Mac, I truly believe that the world as we know it would not be the same without him. The mouse interface, The Graphic Interface, The Image management, The iPod, The iPhone, The iPad, Networks within networks, Clouds, etc... all those devices and platforms that are part of our civilization were possible thanks to his vision. I can compare Steve Jobs' work with Edison, Marconi or Gutenberg, they, as Jobs, modified our world for good and forever...
May u be in heaven creating greatness like you"ve done here on earth.  RIP Steve.
 I would like to say thank you to Steve for being who he was and I  will keep his family in my prayers. He is in a better place now.
 With his imagination, he changed the world! RIP Steve and thank you for every dream you made possible.            
Dear Steve Jobs, thanks for making the world so wonderful.&nbsp;
Thank Steve for being such an innovative person, for bringing us   technology that we can be proud of, that is worth our money. Thanks   for your intelligence. We will miss you.&nbsp;
Deepest condolence, thank you for all the visionary technology that you share to the world. Great man will be remember by his good deeds and his great work to the world. 
I am still struggling to find words after hearing of Steve's passing. I began using Macintosh computers at the age of eight, and twenty years later I still think of myself as a Mac user. Apple products have been so important to my upbringing, and Steve's vision for technology touches us all on a daily basis. I know the legacy will live on for a man who truly was "insanely great."&nbsp;
steve was a great  man  i hope he rest in peace i love the mac with i  would not have the greats computer  in the world. i will mis you steve 
You have been such an inspiration, Steve Jobs.  I'm deeply sadden to hear the news of your pass.  You have made such an great impact in my life with your amazing inventions. My condolences to your family and friends for we have loss a great man but he will never be forgotten.
Thank you for never settling - for always looking to innovate when others wanted to play it safe - to stand out when others wanted to blend.  We all have been inspired. What a legacy to leave for future generations.&nbsp;
Steve took the best advantage of ideas to improve our lives. He never seemed motivated by the success or the wealth. He stayed true to his purpose and have left many of us who use his creations happier. I am very sad about this loss but know our God has a place for Steve. My sincere prayers for his family and friends.
Dear Steve, So much of who I am I owe to you. You and Walt Disney. I was born creative, a visual learner, not the ideal student for our educational system. You inspired me with your vision. With your subtlety and taste. With your insistence on doing good work rather than settling for less like your competitors.  You removed obstacles for me through most of my career. I am still in this business because of you. I would have turned my back on my profession many times were it not for the work of you and your team.  I was glad to suffer the ridicule of the great unwashed masses by stubbornly sticking with Apple through the tough times. Thank you for all you have done. No one else could've done it.&nbsp;
I am so sorry. The Jobs' family has my sincere condolences. As one of my early idols, Steve Jobs and the company he created, Apple, has been with me since my earliest memories. 
The world has lost an Icon! 
Thank you. You made a dent in my universe. Rest peacefully Steve. A JOB well done.&nbsp;
 As I write this on my IPad 2, I send along prayers to the family and friends  of this great man.  He will be missed by the world.
RIP Steve. You changed the lives of everyone on the planet. You have truly paved the way for future generations to continue your work. God Bless you Steve, sorry to see you go. I grieve for you and your family. 
 Mr Jobs was the Thomas Edison of our time. There will never be another visionary and leader of his caliber. Rest in Peace 
 I wanted to thank you, Steve, for everything. Your vision, your drive: the fact that you are one of the few who realized that art is just as important as the technology that drives the world. With death, our pain and suffering ends, we see the world for what it really is. May you be that one step closer to Nirvana. If you come back, may you come back like the force of nature you were in this lifetime. I don't know what else to say, other than this: We'll do you proud in the meantime. &nbsp;
I was completely enamored by this mans success and his charisma. His passing has brought tears to my eyes. May that be a testament to his impact on the people of this world through his brilliance.
The world has lost a very special human being. Apart from his success as the founder of Apple, he was truly a wonderful person. May he be remebered forever, and may his loved ones heal speedily from this tragic loss. Thank you sincerely.&nbsp;
Dear Steve  Thanks for everything.
Steve thanks for everything you have given the world about your vision for apple will always be grateful as all those who love technology, always remember you and always stay hungry stay foolish ... &nbsp;
My sincere condolence goes out to the Jobs family and all of Steve’s friends. Steve not only set out to change the world, he actually did it. Gone too soon. Thanks Steve, for everything.&nbsp;
we will all miss steve.  im only 11 and apple is my life so this is like loosing a family member to me. We will always remember you steve. -Travis and all the people who thought different since the very beginning&nbsp;
Steve...  You are a shadow now.....one that no light will shine on anymore.....unless all the light is put out...your shadow will never be erased from our world.  Thank you for shaping the world....continue shaping heaven for us.   My deepest sympathy
 An icon of my generation is gone..his magic was like that of Walt Disney...he provided exceptionalism and energy to my life..and returned the joy of a child's Christmas again to me through each new product..God keep your soul, and thank you for making my life richer.
Steve Jobs was a brilliant man who helped change technology world as we know it.  His dedication to Apple and his love of innovation has benefited each and every one of us.  He will be greatly missed.  Thank you, Steve.
I have never met Steve in person but i can say it is truly sad to see a  man of his great stature pass away. His work ethics and the way he  communicated with others is what inspired me to do my best. I will miss  your entraining keynotes.  Rest in peace my friend.
<div>We lost a titan.</div>Enough said may he RIP 
We are sorry for your loss, our condolences for all his family and  friends.  We are Apple users since 2006 and since then we love everything he  design. Our world has lost a genius and even that I never meet him, I'm  pretty sure he was a great person Sure we are going to miss him, specially every time he was presenting  new products.&nbsp;
Thank You Steve, thank You for everything. My condolences to all your family and your staff. May your spirit live forever.&nbsp;
I'm very sad but cannot express how I feel right now, need time, something Steve used masterfully. My sympathy and prayers to his family. He is the icon of our time who's legacy and inspiration will live forever.
My condolences to Mr. Jobs family and friends.  Even though I never had the chance to know him or meet him, he greatly impacted my life and I will morn his passing.&nbsp;
 Big Man, Big Mind, Big Loss&nbsp;
Sinto que nesse dia triste pela perda do nosso grande mentor Steven Jobs, a unica coisa a ser feita e agradecer por tudo que nos ensinou, tenho certeza que sera passado pra varias geracoes!  Va com Deus.&nbsp;
A true genius has died today, he will never be forgotten. He has  improved the lives of millions of people and made technology what it is  today. 
It's hard to think of someone that has influenced me more than Steve  Jobs. In my career, my personal life, and even in my social life,  Steve's creation are ever present and will leave a list impression on me  and the world! There won't be another one like him!<div><br></div><div>Thanks.</div>
Sorry to see you go, but you are free to run and play again, in the land that knows no sorrow or pain.  Thanks for making computers fun, and accessible to average folks. God bless.
Respect! I thx mate for all the things you've done for us! :) RIP!
I respectfully express my condolences. 
 I am a grad student from Turkey. Every time i use Apple products for my  studies i appreciate the design and effectiveness that these products  have and provide. I am sorry to hear that the founder of Apple and most  probably the mind behind all these useful products has passed away at an early age.  May God bless his soul and rest in peace.  
My condolences,  to family and friends.  He will be miss, but never forgotten.&nbsp;
Can't even begin to express anything, a simple, my thoughts and prayers are with Steve's family tonight as they mourn the loss of a husband and father.  Thank you for sharing him with us, it can't have been easy, and I hope during this time you are left in peace because some things just don't need to be shared. &nbsp;
You will be missed. Steve was an icon and a true genius. Think you for everything that you have done. 
I grew up with Apple and Steve. I started with black Apple IIs when in primary school in the late 70s, before Apple even built them themselves. Back then it wasn't even curriculum yet, you had to join the "computer club".  In high school I took programming in Pascal on 8086 PCs, but always found time to play on the one Fat Mac we had, a product of Steve's genius.  In college I bought a Mac Classic II, and started working in DTP.  After college my first job was with the local Apple Education reseller. Then in newspapers, then in IT...basing my entire career on the computer for the rest of us.  I was lucky enough to see Steve a couple times on stage, just before his illness. He was powerful to watch, taking control of a huge crowd like he was talking to each one of us individually. The passion that went into every sentence...I have grown up thinking of Steve Jobs as someone who could move mountains and live forever. But now he is gone.  I feel like I have lost a part of my own history, a part of my family.  I will miss him.&nbsp;
Saddened to hear the news and my thoughts are with his family. He did a great job at the helm of Apple and brought some wonderful products to market.
Steve,      Thank you for helping to revolutionize the technology industry.  You will be missed.        RIP&nbsp;
We respect the initiative and vision which are his legacy.  Condolences to all who mourn his death. 
My condolences to his family.  I am deeply saddened although I did not  know him personally.  Heard his 2005 Stanford Commencement Address long  after my first Mac.  My life and my work were, are, and will be changed,  by his life and work.  Thank you, Mr. Jobs.
I am deeply saddened that neither I nor the rest of mankind will continue to experience his unique vision and creativity in so many facets of our lives. Endeavors in Architecture, Movies, Music, Technology, were all enhanced greatly by this man. The World is a better place because of him and a more enjoyable place due to him.
I am writing as someone who appreciates that people are complex beings who aren't all good or bad and never perfect.  That being written Steve Jobs was a truly unique human being in the course of recent history.  He was able to see what others could not and believed in his own vision.  He touched many lives in so many ways and even if that was happenstance, it was also providence.  Wow, will you be missed Steve.  I wish you could have been here longer. 
Whenever I thought of Apple products, I just thought....wow. This is what the human race is capable of. With hard work, focus, and drive, look at what humans accomplish! Your genius will live on in the works of others who have been inspired by your struggle with cancer and your life-long commitment to innovation and design. It's not technology that mattered--but human need. Not the fashion--but the quality.  A moved and saddened customer. 
Steve Jobs was THE most brilliant man with such vision he will be missed immensely! Look out Heaven, you thought it was cool before...Our thoughts and prayers are will his family and friends and every single person that was touched by the life and mind of Steve Jobs. &nbsp;
I am sad and depress with the news. Steve Jobs is my inspiration!   He is my mentor into exploring things and to be not afraid in taking risk. Into believing what you can do. To do what you want most - your passion! Into inspiring people to live life to the fullest.  I am a 23 year old boy in The Philippines and i am about to put a business! He will be my inspiration to believe what i can do!  I will miss the MAN behind Apple today!&nbsp;
One of my role models. I always lived to think, I wanna live to be like  this guy one day creating tomorrows technology. Steve made some very big  changes in this world. He's in a better place now. :) I just wish he  stuck around a little bit longer. Steve will always be my model and true  a visionary to technology enthusiasts around the world. RIP Mr. Jobs. 
You were my hero. You will be missed. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to Steve's family. I have been a major fan of Steve and Apple since the beginning. Mr. Jobs has had a profound impact on my life. He was one of a kind and will be missed by not only me, but by the world. We have to make sure that Steve's vision for the future of Apple and the world is not forgotten but developed and refined, as he would have wished. I look forward to continuing to enjoy the products and services that is Steve Jobs for the rest of my life. Every time I am on my iPhone, iPad or Mac, I will be thinking of Steve and continue to be inspired by him. Thank you Steve Jobs And God Bless you and your Family. You will be missed.&nbsp;
I can't believe it! He presented a bright future to us.&nbsp;
I would just like to say what an inspiration, motivation, intelligent,  and great person that Steve Jobs was.  He innovated technology forever,  inventing the device that most kids listen to music on, the iPod.  He  invented the iPhone, iPad, and Mac OSX.  His ideas and thoughts of how  things should be were fantastic.  His ideas of products were  unsurpassed.  Steve Jobs was and is the Father of Apple, and now it's up  to Apple to continue where Steve Jobs brought the company, and always  remember his thoughts and ideas.  Steve Jobs will be dearly missed, and  I just wanted to say my condolences to the Jobs Family and everyone else  of Apple.  R.I.P Steve Jobs:&nbsp;
Steve allways lived to share visions, in a very special way. Making them  possible to us, with excelence! Thank's Steve.&nbsp;
 When my disability took away my ability to type on the clunky keyboards of times past, Apple released the thin notebook-style keyboards that allowed me to keep typing. When I was no longer able to type on those keyboards, a wonderful Mac onscreen keyboard app saved me. When I could no longer play video games because I wasn't strong enough to operate a controller, the iPhone's touch technology brought it back. When I wanted to write a novel and pointing and clicking on an onscreen keyboard was too slow, an iPhone remote app let me type on my Mac using the iPhone's small touchscreen keyboard.  The technology inspired by Steve Jobs has helped me keep going when my atrophied body was trying to stop me. I applaud his accomplishments and am grateful for his help. So here's to the crazy one himself.  Cheers to the Apple team. &nbsp;
 He was a great man, who changed the entire the world with his vision. Without iphone and other itechnologies, I can not imagine how the world would look like right now. Thank you Steve...YOU ARE THE BESTEST R.I.P. Steve Jobs&nbsp;
The world has indeed lost a wounderful man today (10/5/11). Steve was   one of the best inventers the world had to offer. I give my condolenes   to his family and every one this sad sad day has effected. Apple will   never be the same with out him. He will always be remembered.&nbsp;
Dear Jobs family  Just want you to know that I have always admired Steve and have viewed  him as one of my greats role models. He will truly be missed and you all  are in my thoughts and prayers
I owe my career (my life?) to Steve.  In 1979, at 14 years old, I walked into Byte Computers, one of the very few computer stores in Vancouver, British Columbia. I saw my first computer, an Apple ][ computer running a game called Grapevine and my life was never the same. I spent my Saturdays learning Apple Basic using Apple ][ computers in the stores of friendly owners.  In 1982 I got a job selling Apple computers and the first sale I made was an  Apple, a //e I think.  Last week, I found my acceptance letter for one of the first technical training courses for the NeXT.  I write this from my iPhone 4. I could be watching my Apple TV, or using my MacBook Pro to write this, while listening to my iPod Classic in the dock.  My introduction to technology from Apple has fed, clothed, housed, entertained, and enabled work for my family and for that I say, "Thanks, Steve.".&nbsp;
Dear Steve, although i'm not an Apple user or fan but i can't feel greatest loss of you. You have changed the world with your vision and mission which impacted the lives of millions, your creativity and charismatic character have brought you and Apple becomes great today. Sure Apple will be continue doing their amazing job as your legacy will be remembered always. Thanks you very much Steve Job. Rest in Peace and may God Bless you :( 
Thank you for bringing such a wonderful innovation to this world from an iMac to an i pad  from an iPod to an iPhone...  I still remember the first time I got my first mac... I screamed and jumped all over my house.. a happiness that can't be explained by words...  thank you for all your hard works  thank you for all the amazing iLife that come to my life. &nbsp;Remembering Steve Jobs  from  an Indonesia
Steve Jobs was a true inspiration. i wouldnt be where i am now without him. OMG how can this happen. Apple will never be the same, :'((( NOOOOOOOO 
Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn’t matter to me.… Going to bed at night saying we’ve done something wonderful—that’s what matters to me.—CNNMoney/Fortune, May 25, 1993  You did it, Mr Jobs.  Congratulations.  You changed all of our lives and will continue to for years to come.  Bless you
Steve may well be one of the greatest geniuses our planet will ever see. His vision, determination and energy for what he believed in was remarkable. He achieved something no other company has been able to do. He identified our era. Through his ideas he’s changed the lives of millions of children, teenagers and adults alike. Culturally, he’s molded our modern world. More than anything Steve had a passion that will continue to live on. This is a time of mourning for us all. We have lost one of natures most treasured gifts.     May you rest in peace Steve.     
my deepest condolencies to his family, friends and co-workers ... may you all be comforted w/peace &amp; ressignation soon p.d. the whole world will miss one of it's most charming &amp; visionary leaders ... may he rest in peace 
It's 7:30 pm (Guadalajara, Mexico) from today October 5th. I interrupted my class to obtain an information from my mac. When opened the homepage, I found that ''Steve Jobs has passed away''.  I'm highly in shock because, unquestionably, however, we all know the human being sooner or later needs to pass through this trance (and continues to be impressive), and when one is a genius, such as Steve was, who has been of benefit to so many people, it is of lamenting, because he and his close friends have delivered us a wonderful tool, which to me, still is a magical one.  Steve, you're not only in our desks, but in our minds and in our hearts, and every time we turn on our macs, it'll be a ''good-bye'' wherever you are.&nbsp;
I just wanted to say thank you to Steve Jobs and everyone at Apple, not  as a fan or as a consumer but as a student. These products including the  macBook and the iPad have made my life as a student so much easier and  made it accessible for people like to want to do work and enjoyable to  do work. Too many emotions running through my head, but the biggest one  has to be gratitude. Apple has truly revolutionized the way we live are  lives. Thank Mr. Jobs, May you rest in peace&nbsp;
As I seat here and type this message, I am currently studying in the librar y of Texas Tech University for my Managerial Communications exam. I am a 23  year old Junior who recently went back to school for simple purpose of making something of myself like Steve did so many years ago.  Steve was the person who inspired me to go back, after years of seeing how  he kept changing the world. I wanted to give myself an opportunity, the knowledge, charisma and enthusiasm that Steve showed our world. The impact he  had on world of business is unimaginable all my text books mention him as m astermind of his profession.  To Steve's family, friends, and loved ones my prayers are with you.  And all I really want to tell Steve is a simple "Thank You" for giving me t he courage and inspiration to one day complete my dream like you did.&nbsp;
Dear Steve,  I don’t know where to begin. While this letter is nothing more than a self-indulgent form of catharsis, I feel as though I must write it. I’m in my third year of undergraduate studies; I’m studying Computer Science and Theatre Arts. Your work, as CEO of Apple and as a human being, is a strong reason why I took up the former and eventually the latter.  I’ll keep my remarks short. Apple computers, iPods, iPhones, and iPads are the kinds of things that drove me to go into Computer Science. These devices are near magic and science fiction, yet somehow because of your vision and the collective vision of everyone at Apple, they’re reality. I went into undergraduate thinking I was going to be a Computer Scientist the whole way through, but then I stumbled across a commencement speech you made at Stanford in 2005. “Your time is limited,” you said. ”So don’t waste it living someone else’s life. … Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.” I remembered all the self-expression, all the joy I found in the theatre, and decided to take on the Theatre Arts major.  I have you to thank so much for your inspiration, and I know I’m not the only one. Your legacy won’t be that of iPhones and MacBooks, but of inspiration and an idea that you can change the way things are with one “crazy” idea.
I just counted up all the apple products we have at home and it's 16! I'm typing on a macbook pro right now and I have Steve to thank for that. He was a visonary and I looked up to him for letting his ideas change the world, and they will continue to change the world from now on. My first laptop I ever typed on was my Dad's old powerbook. I loved it and we still have it, though it no longer turns on and it's in two pieces, I love the memories it has. I have always stood by apple and will always buy Apple. They are the creative, fun, colourful side of an ever-greying world of technology and business. They are a ray of sunshine and I will always remember Steve as the person who taught me to love technology and the joy it can bring to our lives! APPLE FOREVER! 
 To Steve Jobs' family and friends - Working with technology is probably the most up to date job. Because of Mr. Jobs' wonderful ideas, I can, from my iPad, send my condolences to all his relatives. Steve Jobs wrote his history in the computers, tablets, cell phones, gadgets , but most of all, he wrote his history in our lives, through his amazing mind. He was defeated by some illness, unfortunately, but his legacy will last forever.  Our best regards. Rest in peace, Mr. Jobs.&nbsp;
Hello All I can say is that I admired him since he create Apple. Not only he was a great visionary and a great CEO, he was a person that made you believe that everything he did was the best out there.  Thank you Steve jobs for everything you have giving us and for everything you left us. I lost my dad at 56 years old now I lost my boss at the same age. I am truly sad and hurt from that news I would like to offer my condolences to his family, to my fellow coworker at apple and to the world for a great lost. May you rest in peace.  Joseph&nbsp;
A very sad day...  Steve changed the world and was a true visionary and his creativity and energy will be really missed. RIP 
I am one of the lucky ones who had the pleasure and experience to work for Apple...he truly changed my life...
It's hard to comprehend that such a marvel is gone He was such a  visionary.  Now every day, every person who owns a little piece of his  magic will look back and say "Now this truly is.. magic." 
I one time wrote a speech on Steve. We were supposed to write about someone who we looked up to and write a biography. I wrote it like I was interviewing him. Steve was definitely a visionary person and provided so many ideas to Apple and influenced so many people.&nbsp;
What this man has given the world is beyond exceptional... truly a   wonderful human being who gave so very much to humanity to help   advance us on this technical journey... thank you seems inadequate-   but Thank you Steve -  my 1st computer was the old Apple II E- what a wonderful brain it had,   even back in the early 80's... 
You gave us the tools. Thanks to you Mr. Jobs  YOU helped me in school as student and now you are helping me at work as an architect. Being active and embrace the time we have is the lesson. Make your wildest dreams a tangible reality is the work of a true visionary. Thank you for helping me to evolve professionally and reach my dreams. I'll go for more...   Thank You Mr. Jobs&nbsp;
I work for Apple but never had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Jobs. I want  to take a second to thank him for never backing down, for never giving  in, and for having the courage to innovate and design what people wanted  even when they didn't know it themselves. His passion and drive are  incredibly inspiring and he has left a legacy that will touch our world  forever. He changed the world and now its up to us to honor what he has  done and continue inspiring, innovating and imagining. You will be  greatly missed. Rest in peace.
My Grandmother, she is now 83, told me after using her new iPad that she  thinks with this device she could actually live on for some years more  because of it. She never used a computer before and did always regret this missed  opportunity. Your products, Steve, they even made my Grandmother an  iPad-User after 80 years never touching such a thing because she wasn't  scared. No, because she was excited about it!  I always wanted to tell you this, but never did - until it's too late.  May your seeds grow on in this company you build and may the happiness  you spread all over the world be a comfort for those who stood close to  you. My love to you Steve, you, who I think it's safe to say defined the  beginning of the 21st Century.    Rest in Peace.
I have no tears in my eyes but my heart is crying out loud that this is not true. Steve Jobs you will be reminded as a visionary and the only man who brought the value of "I" to the world.&nbsp;
I write down in a paper and put on my wall, his speech back in 2005.  His last words : Stay hungry! Stay foolish.     Thanks Steve
He was one of&nbsp;three&nbsp;great&nbsp;entrepreneurs&nbsp;of our time! Someone to be inspired by. <br>
Our  deepest  sympathies  in  these  very  sad  moments  for  family   and  friends.
Before working at Apple I had never not used an Apple product for nearly 15 years.  I had never owned an iPod or iPhone, nor did I own a Mac.  But I knew who Steve Jobs was.  He was one of the biggest reasons why I took the job with Apple Retail.  Now I can't imagine working anywhere else.  Thank you Steve for your guidance and leadership.  I hope to make half the impact you made on the world.
I just want to give my support and say that Steve was a true visionary. As he once said "Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower." 
It's 3.17 in France and i just read one of the sadest news of the year.  Today, the world looses one of its genius.  Sadly yours
Very sad. Thank you Steve and Apple for your contribution to the world of communication. It's much appreciated.
. Steve. Thank you for your inspiration, for showing us what could be.   You were the original crazy one.   You were the genius.   You dared to be different.   You dared to fail.   You dared to succeed.   You dared to tell us what we wanted - most definitely against marketing tradition which says give 'em what they want.   You knew we didn't know what we wanted until you thought it into existence.   and then built it.    and showed it to us, like a proud parent.   You were. and always will be.   Insanely great.&nbsp;
  On behalf of all the orphans of the intelligence of Mr. Steve Jobes, I send my condolences and thanks! 
I'm apple user from Malaysia . So sad to know that Steve jobs was left us today. But he does give us a lot of inspiration and motivation. Thanks to bring us iPhone, iPad, iPod and mac. My life become more meaningful and convenie nt because of you and your team. We will love you and remember you. Your spi rit will always lead the whole apple team to another higher level. I believe ! RIP.
As someone diagnosed with cancer at 21 years old, Steve's drive, determination, strength and willpower through his cancer has given me hope for my future. What an inspiration he's been to every person who has ever dreamed. You will be missed, but not forgotten. Your amazing legacy will live on!
A true genius and pioneer. The world will miss him! 
To Steve's family, friends, and colleagues, It deeply saddens me to hear of Steve's passing. He was an inspiration for me and all of us in the tech industry. His was a bright example of what can be done by those who do not accept the status quo.  I know there is nothing that can be done to bring him back, but please let me know if there is any way I can help to make his passing any more bearable. Steve will forever be fondly remembered by me! With my utmost condolences.
He was an inspiration to us all. I know I'll miss him; I only hope those he inspired will be able to continue his dreams. 
Steve,   Thank you for changing our world. From Malaysia   
For the countless empowering words, I am writing today. I'm working in a family business that focuses on printing. Times can be rough for this industry, but your ideas and beliefs have given  me hope. There were times where I solidly believed, that it was because of technology  that this company was having a difficult time; however, over time it made me  realize that was a mistake. It was the lack of innovation, mundane tasks  that forbid creativity to be unleashed. Your company, your methods, your work has given me the inspiration to move  forward. The ability to recover from rock bottom, presentations that gets the world  go wild, products that actually changes people's lives... it's not something  everyone can do, but your most important message of all was to being passion  driven with what we do. I love my job, and I have to give some credit to Apple for making me feel  this way. Thank you, and may you rest in peace.&nbsp;
In memory of his passing why not name the new iphone the iphone Jobs. RIP mate from a loyal apple fan&nbsp;
    Steve was a great man that changed the world of computing both worldwide and for me personally. His products have dominated my spaces. He was truly a unique visionary and will forever be missed.&nbsp;
My creativity as a child through today would not have been possible without you. Thank you, Steve Jobs
The world is forever a different place... difficult to measure the impact of loss of such genius and vision. My condolences to family and friends.
Steve Jobs, que gran vaco deja en este mundo la partida de uno de los grandes seres que han revolucionado nuestras vidas, una gran pena el saber que se va pero un bonito recuerdo de lo que nos deja, descanse en paz.&nbsp;
I cannot imagine life without all that Steve Jobs has contributed to our world. &nbsp;I remember my uncle showing me the new Apple computer he had just got for his bank in Hastings, NE. &nbsp;He was able to show me, at the tender age of 11 or 12, that if I saved a certain amount of money each year, that I could have millions for retirement. &nbsp;Well I didn't exactly follow my uncle's advice, but I have been an Apple Mac user ever since. &nbsp;I was an early adaptor and always had Mac computers from the first time I could ever buy my own computer. &nbsp;I certainly was the first among my friends to own an Apple computer. The iPod was revolutionary, and then the iPhone, life changing. &nbsp;I can only dream of what Steve may have been able to dream up and create had he been able to live longer.&nbsp; My sympathy to his family and coworkers at Apple.
    You were an incredible man with an incredible vision of the future. You had such a passionate connection with technology in such an artistic way. I always saw you as a musician of technology  and no one else will ever come close to that.  My thoughts are going out to your family and wish them all the Love comfort possible. Rest in Peace Steve Jobs, and thank you so much for all that you have done.
My mom went to work for Apple when the Apple 2 first came out. We were so excited when you gave her our first computer. Later she worked on the Macintosh program.We were even more excited when you gave her one of the prototypes. It still works today! Thank you for everything you have done for my family by creating this great company.&nbsp;
Part of me went with him. He is, and forever will be, an integral  part of my daily life.  My vote for the greatest CEO America has  been cast.  My tears for the loss of a most extraordinary person.&nbsp;
I never met the man but feel such a deep loss. I can't stop thinking about how he helped make our world wonderful and magical. I'm just so extremely sad right now. He was a personal hero of mine.&nbsp;
Sending my very sincere condolences to the Jobs family (as well as the Apple family). Watching a loved one fall ill is an indescribable pain - thoughts and prayers to everyone who knew him personally, especially his wife and kids. Steve's professional legacy lives on in my daily life and that of so many others. His creative and innovative achievements are beyond inspiring and impressive. He was a genius and will be missed. 
Dear Apple As many, Steve had a huge influence of what I am today and how I work today and I feel sad he had to leave so early. I will try to keep his way of thinking in my live and will support Apple with all I can. I'm sorry and I'm with you in these hours.&nbsp;
To the Jobs family and the employees of Apple,   My condolences on the loss of Mr. Jobs.     Truly a visionary and obviously a great leader I am grateful to him for taking the risk and having the brilliance to create breathtaking technology. From graphical computers, to Pixar, to the stunning iPhones and iPads, the world is a better, more connected, more fun and far more beautiful place because of Steve.   It is a sad day for all of you but equally for the United States, the world and certainly for me.   My thoughts and prayers are with you.&nbsp;
I write this note with a heavy heart. I feel like I have lost a dear friend.  I remember my childhood days looking in the shop windows at the magical Apple II computers on display. Today, I have numerous Apple products that became possible because of Steve's vision and leadership.  I hope the path he blazed at Apple will continue to be one that leads by shifting paradigms, and changing the game by creating platforms that are entirely new.  Thank you Steve for your vision to wow me with that Apple II; for my first Apple LC II, for my PowerBook, and now for my MacBook, for my MacBook Pro, my iPad 2, my Apple TV, and that ingenious iPhone. Thank you!
Very few deaths have moved me, and even fewer of these are of a celebrity status. This one moved me. Rest in peace. &nbsp;
Steve Jobs left an indelible market not only on the computing or electronics industries, but really on contemporary human life. I have never been a gadget geek but I came to love and use and thread Apple products into my personal life. &nbsp;Through his products, I took and viewed the first photos of my daughter, connected to family through video, shared stories and laughter with friends while texting and walking through my neighborhood. &nbsp;The confidence Apple and Steve had in creating and delivering upon everyday people's needs has changed the way that I interact every minute of the day. &nbsp;His vision, his discipline, his passion and his appreciation for aesthetics within technology have truly touched my life. Thank you to Steve and his family and my greatest hopes that the company will continue to fulfill his vision and be true to his dreams.
My condolences to the entire Apple family for the loss of such a wonderful leader.&nbsp;   Thank you Steve for literally thinking outside of the box and for being such a great innovator.&nbsp; You will truly be missed.
I just wanted to send my deepest condolences to the family, friends and  co-workers of Steve. My roommates and I all just agreed we feel a  precious being is now gone. As I type this on my macbook, with music  from my iPod blasting, I really can feel the impact.&nbsp;
APPLE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME..to family and close friends, I'm extremely  sorry for your loss, even for me, a complete stranger to him from Costa  Rica, it hurts too much. 
You never knew me, but you changed my life in a way most people who do know me never did.&nbsp;
There is no easy way to say or write this letter, first and foremost my prayers go out to Steve Jobs' family and friends. I would like to give thanks for everything and everyone involved in Steve Jobs life and without the tech that has been inspired by Steve Jobs and everyone else involved, I could not see any other way to stay connected to my family and friends as easy without the iDevices of todays generation and to be part of Steve's Jobs tech era, i'm just glade to have lived in this time era and to be able to own the products that came from Steve Jobs heart and soul.   We will miss you and your inspiration, from the words of Steve Jobs (it just works)  everything will work out and the love out there for you is undoubting enormous, you will be missed.
Steve Jobs was the pinnacle of the Apple company, his a true inspiration, and will be truly missed.
Estoy muy impactado por esta noticia tan grande!!! Aqui en Costa Rica estoy muy conmovido y muy dolido por esta perdida tan grande.... donde quiera que estes Steve jobs you change my LIFE!!!! APPLE 4 EVER!!!
